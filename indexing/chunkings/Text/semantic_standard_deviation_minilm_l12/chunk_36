how many partner laboratories does your practice have in total? mean: 2,6 labs the presence of the laboratory in the dental practice is a specific feature of the german market, less frequent in other countries (less than 10%). the peculiarities of spain is due to legislative issues: the laboratory must be separated from the practice by law (even when the activities are in the same location, they must have separate entrance). only 20% of dental practices collaborate with a single laboratory (31% in uk), about one in two clinics has at least 3 laboratory partners. clinic base: 1.061 cases base: 1.061 cases specialization of the clinic does your clinic specialize in only a few disciplines, or does it develop almost all treatments? 7 if it is specialized: in which disciplines? in general, although 13% of dental practices can be considered multi-disciplinary, the dental sector - in the analyzed countries - is almost entirely made up of general practices. 54% of those reporting specializations perform orthodontics (this accounts for 7% of the total number of clinics surveyed, from which those performing exclusively orthodontics have been excluded). the sample do not include practices exclusively specialized in orthodontics clinic cases 256 224 200 201 180 germany france italy spain uk implantology 75% 68% 66% 82% 48% surgery 71% 53% 79% 76% 36% orthodontics 53% 35% 50% 64% 82% periodontology 56% 46% 50% 51% 36% prosthetics (fixed / mobile) 51% 19% 67% 49% 54% aesthetics 53% 28% 34% 56% 50% restorative 53% 28% 25% 48% 60% endodontics 35% 25% 59% 49% 54% pediatric dentistry 49% 14% 34% 36% 42% cases 256 224 200 201 180 number of treatments per month considering a standard working month in 2021, how many of the following treatments are performed in your clinic overall? 8 the here shown overall mean values of the monthly production (among the surveyed sample), although they should be used as an indication only, allow to retrieve very useful data on the weight for some of the key treatments in the dental practices. by considering the performance heterogeneity in the surveyed countries (due to the average size of the centers and the characteristics of the demand for dental treatments), the following slide shows the breakdown by geographical area. please note, the indirect restorations (veneers, inlays and onlays), are not included in the new cases of fixed prosthetics. it should be noted that the used opinion poll approach, which does not include the responses of \"non clinic owners, is not totally representative of the actual stratification of the reference universe with regard to the type and size of the dental practices. therefore, this methodology does not allow for the projection of the mean values of the sample on the reference universe in order to assess the total market. 4,3 18,6 84,7 average 73,2 9,6 9,0 6,8 clinic although the focus of the research is the digital flow, in light of a possible integration of the use of technologies and the different restorative, prosthetic and orthodontic therapies, it has been decided to investigate the number of treatments carried out in the clinic regarding fillings/restoration, oral hygiene/scaling, fixed protheses, implants, veneers, inlays/onlays and professional whitening. base: 1.061 cases treatments summary 9 in addition to the analysis of the production mean values by geographic area, it is very important to consider the penetration of the different therapies (kind of therapy performed: yes / no). nevertheless, the averages are calculated on the total sample: the practices not performing a given treatment have been considered with value = it should be noted that the used opinion poll approach, which does not include the responses of \"non clinic owners, is not totally representative of the actual stratification of the reference universe with regard to the type and size of the dental practices. therefore, this methodology does not allow for the projection of the mean values of the sample on the reference universe in order to assess the total market. clinic mean 5,4 dental technicians 12,7 served practices 1999 10 sample segmentation demographic and structural clusters - all labo base: 594 cases 11 sample segmentation demographic and structural clusters labo germany france italy spain uk employee 13% 7% 2% 4% 13% manager or director 30% 34% 6% 15% 45% owner 57% 60% 93% 82% 42% i influence the decision 44% 33% 30% 14% 49% i decide by myself 56% 67% 70% 86% 51% 1 or 2 12% 26% 54% 46% 18% 3 or 4 26% 32% 29% 20% 34% 5 or 6 23% 17% 8% 20% 18% more than 6 37% 25% 9% 14% 30% 5,4 7,5 5,3 3,3 4,4 6,1 up to 5 18% 18% 40% 20% 18% from 6 to 9 30% 28% 25% 22% 27% from 10 to 15 31% 23% 15% 28% 28% more than 15 14% 25% 18% 24% 17% 12,7 11,5 15,8 10,8 13,7 12,0 before 2000 41% 37% 75% 58% 31% from 2000 to 2010 39% 40% 18% 21% 37% from 2011 to 2021 21% 22% 7% 21% 32% 1999 1999 2002 1992 1998 2003 no 84% 90% 67% 55% 58% yes 16% 10% 33% 45% 42% cases 137 114 125 113 105 dental lab association profession role number of dental technicians number of served dental practices laboratory opening year overall production of treatments - breakdown considering a standard working month, how many of the following cases are performed in your lab overall?
