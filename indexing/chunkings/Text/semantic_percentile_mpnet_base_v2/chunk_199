overall production please, note that a given share of in-house production is produced for third party laboratories, therefore the below table also shows the production for dentists, thus excluding the production for third parties. this is the relevant information to calculate the breakdown of the production by channel. percentage of laboratories 111 the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. trend analysis 2018 2017 2016 2015 2013 2012 18-17 up to 10 36% 39% 55% 58% 57% 72% 2,2% more than 10 64% 61% 45% 42% 43% 28% 2,2% total (providers of cad-cam elements) 405 310 319 312 338 316 average number of elements per week 25,1 22,7 15,2 17,1 15,8 21,1 production for dentists only 23,5 22,0 14,4 16,6 15,3 19,0 total (providers of cad-cam elements) 405 310 319 312 338 312 average number of cad-cam elements east (33,2) age of the laboratory owner >55 aos (36,3) 1 technician (10,4) 3 or more technicians (34,7) served practices <=5 (14,5) served practices >10 (36,3) monthly purchases <=500 (10,1) monthly purchases >1000 (31,6) a steep increase in the average number of cad- cam elements can be noticed, if the last three years are considered. in-house production share considering all the elements produced with your milling unit, what percentage is produced for dental surgeries and what percentage for other dental labs? in-house this information is crucial to calculate the breakdown of the production, because the share of production towards other laboratories must be excluded from the overall production to extrapolate the one related to dentists only. percentage of elements 112 the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. trend analysis 2018 % 2017 % 2016 % 2015 % 2013 % 2012 % 18-17 in-house elements 28,3 100,0% 31,5 100,0% 23,3 100,0% 32,0 100,0% 27,9 100,0% 38,3 100,0% production for dentists 23,8 84,2% 28,8 91,5% 18,4 78,9% 28,4 88,8% 24,7 88,5% 29,3 76,5% 7,3% production for other laboratories 4,5 15,8% 2,7 8,5% 4,9 21,1% 3,6 11,3% 3,2 11,5% 9,0 23,5% 7,3% total (milling units owners) 153 77 55 49 53 70 materials for in-house production considering all the elements produced with your milling unit, what percentage is produced with blocks and what percentage with discs?
