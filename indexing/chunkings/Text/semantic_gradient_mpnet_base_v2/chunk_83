47 base: 411 cases focus on digital restoration providers among digital technology users, the most used technology is scanner, followed by the in lab milling unit. the most used way to provide digital restorations is to send scans to a manufacturer or milling center. processing without don't know 55% is the percent of scanner owners, out of the total digital restorations providers, who use the scanner to send the files outside for milling. the total % of scanner owners, including those used with the in-lab milling units is 84%, as shown in the following slides. scenario: digital technology use - breakdown by technology how do you provide digital restorations in your laboratory? 48 base: 411 cases focus on digital restoration providers the highest percentage of respondents stating to use a scanner is in uk, while the lowest one is spain, which also shows the highest percentage of full outsourcing users. processing without don't know scenario: digital technology use - breakdown by channel how do you provide digital restorations in your laboratory? 49 base: 411 cases focus on digital restoration providers with regard to the channels used, the manufacturer/milling center is the most used one, followed by the partner lab. processing without don't know scenario: digital technology use - breakdown by channel how do you provide digital restorations in your laboratory? 50 base: 411 cases focus on digital restoration providers germany, on par with uk, shows the highest percentage of respondents stating to use the manufacturers to produce digital restorations, while spain shows the highest percentage in the use of a partner lab. processing without don't know scenario: digital technology use - technologies and channels how do you provide digital restorations in your laboratory? 51 for example, among those using a scanner, 11% of them also have an in-lab milling. for example, those sending their restorations to a partner lab, 60% of the cases have a scanner for sending scans outside and 11% of the cases also have an in-lab milling. base: 411 cases the chart allows to evaluate the percentage of users of different technologies, in comparison with the same technologies and the different channels used. please, see the example on the right. focus on digital restoration providers processing without don't know technologies scenario: digital technology use - channels and technologies how do you provide digital restorations in your laboratory? 52 for example, among those performing full outsourcing, 42% of them send the models to a manufacturer and 84% of them send the models to a partner lab. for example, those sending their restorations to a partner lab in 11% of the cases they also have an in-lab milling and in 48% of the cases they also send the restorations to a manufacturer/milling center. base: 411 cases the chart allows to evaluate the percentage of users of different technologies, in comparison with the same technologies and the different channels used. please, see the example on the right. focus on digital restoration providers processing without don't know channels brand numeric distribution and intention to buy brand numeric distribution: scanners (scans sent outside only) what is the brand of your scanner?
