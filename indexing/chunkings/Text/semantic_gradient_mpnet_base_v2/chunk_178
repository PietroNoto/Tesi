base: 588 cases (whole sample) the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. younger technicians show a greater propensity to spend. in the most recent and largest laboratories, spending grows significantly. 7 mean 1.823 1.686 1.358 1.567 1.796 543 1.285 2.613 666 1.342 2.700 trend analysis 2018 2017 18-17 less than 500 23% 18% 5,27% from 501 to 1000 16% 18% 1,99% more than 1000 31% 24% 7,62% don't know / no answer 29% 40% 10,90% total 588 590 mean (euros) 1.659 1.533 total 415 352 it use customized laboratory management software do you use a management software in your laboratory? 9 base: 588 cases (whole sample) 67% of the interviewed laboratories use a management software. the use is higher among younger technicians, in the most recent labs and in the largest ones. also among those technicians who perceive the future of the laboratory in a positive way, the use of these programs is more frequent. customized laboratory management software 38% of laboratories use a digital cloud. the majority of them use it to store the data (35%), followed by those who use it to exchange information with their clients (23%) and 19% who use it for other reasons. although the technical or laboratory profile changes slightly depending on the use they make of these technologies, it seems that their implementation prevails in laboratories in the north and between those with three or more employees. digital cloud for professional purposes do you use a digital cloud for professional purposes? 10 base: 588 cases (whole sample) customized digital cloud for professional purposes to store data to exchange data other purposes madrid center (23%) 1 technician (23%) 3 or more technicians (47%) monthly purchases <=500 (27%) madrid center (14%) north (34%) 1 technician (12%) 3 o ms tcnicos (32%) madrid center (10%) north (33%) 1 technician (6%) 3 or more technicians (27%) served practices <=5 (11%) served practices >10 (26%) macro trends the following analysis shows the perceived market trend stated by the interviewees. the resulting trend is a feeling of the interviewees, and it is not the result of a quantitative evaluation of the production. the psychological component may have, therefore, a strong influence on the results. business trend of the laboratory - past 12 months considering the overall business of your laboratory in the last 12 months, what was the trend compared to the previous period? base: 588 cases (whole sample) 12 the segmentation by geographic areas shows a quite heterogeneous situation with respect to the perceived trend, although the positive perception of those located in the madrid center area, is more statistically significant. it also seems that younger technicians seem to be more optimistic. finally, the analysis reveals that the most recent and larger laboratories more frequently claim to have had an increase in their business. business trend of the laboratory - expectations about the next 12 months what trend do you think will be, in your laboratory, in the next 12 months? 13 base: 588 cases (whole sample) 13 with regard to the expected future trend, once again young technicians are more optimistic than average, and so is for the most recent and largest laboratories. analysis of confidence perception of current situation vs. perception of the future base: 588 cases (whole sample) perception of current situation perception about the future in this section, a confidence index is shown, based on the evaluation of the responses. the method consist of a comparison between the perception of the situation over the last 12 months versus the forecast for the future. the chart on the left shows that the majority of the respondents perceive a stable situation (38%). however, 41% of respondents perceived an increase in their business, while about 20% perceived a decrease. in the future trend forecast, the majority of the responses are neutral, in fact, 54% foresee an unchanged situation, while 38% of respondents think that the future business will increase, while 7% states there will be a decrease. 14 analysis of confidence perception of current situation vs. perception of future situation base: 588 cases (whole sample) the answers regarding the current and future trend of the practice certainly are affected by the psychological component. in order to objectively assess the level of confidence in the future, it may be useful to put in relation the 2 variables. in fact, the answer it will remain stable does have a negative value if the respondent perceived a reduction, while it becomes a positive answer when the respondent experienced a development of the business. in order to obtain an unbiased confidence index, we assume that when the current situation is considered negative, the confidence index will be considered positive only when a consistent increase is the forecast for the future. vice versa, if theres a current positive situation, a stable forecast will be considered a positive forecast too. the model highlights a generalized optimism. 66% of the respondents shows a positive confidence index, 22% is neutral and 12% show a negative index. thus, the global index is positive (54%). 15 it will decrease a lot it will decrease slightly it will remain stable it will increase slightly it will increase a lot increased a lot 0,0% 0,1% 1,3% 2,6% 0,8% 33% 66% increased slightly 0,0% 0,2% 13,6% 22,7% 3,9% 33% stable 0,0% 0,7% 17,6% 18,6% 1,6% 22% 54% decreased slightly 0,1% 0,8% 8,5% 4,6% 0,8% 9% decreased a lot 0,3% 0,2% 1,1% 0,0% 0,0% 2% 12% future situation current situation analysis of confidence perception of current situation vs. perception of future situation base: 588 cases (whole sample) thanks to the cooperation with a psychologist expert in behavioral techniques and market dynamics, a socio-psychologic interpretation has been given to each cluster.", "type": "Document"}}
