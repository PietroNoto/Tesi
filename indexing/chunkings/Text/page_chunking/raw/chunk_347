As for the dental laboratories, the performance of Sirona faces the presence of other brands \nlike 3shape, Dental Wings, Zirkonzahn and Amann Girrbach. The factor analysis highlighted a possible \npositioning of the mentioned brands according to two main factors, the Nearness and the Reputation \npossibly affecting the recommendation. While on the sample of dental practices the positioning \nresulted to be rather affected by the performance of Sirona, whose position was not distinctive, the \nanalysis performed on the dental laboratories highlighted Kavo positioning to be more related to the \nNearness, and so was for Bego, while other brands like Ivoclar Vivadent, 3shape and Zirkonzahn have \nbeen more linked to the Reputation. \nThe use of the different equipment is more widespread among the dental laboratories, whose \npenetration resulted to be far higher than the dental practices. The fact that the technical market may \nbe considered rather more mature than the clinical one, is proved by the intention to buy digital \nequipment in the future, whose value was just 12% versus 21% of the dental practices. \nThe brand numeric distribution highlighted a higher number of competitors present in the technical \nsegment than the clinical one, and the distribution highlighted the same brands mentioned in the \nawareness analysis. \nThe most important reasons to use mentioned by the respondents were related to ease of use, comfort, \nquality and efficiency, other than the possibility offered by this kind of technology to shorten the \nproduction workflow and increase the productivity, but the multivariate analysis performed on the \nsatisfaction highlighted some critical items related to the service and support from the manufacturers, \nwhich didn\u2019t receive fully satisfactory scores, but whose importance in the assessment of the overall \nsatisfaction was above average. \n \n \n", "type": "Document"}}
