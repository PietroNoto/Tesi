For example, a confidence level of 95% means that the phenomenon\nidentified by the research is certain in 95% of cases.\n\u2022\nThe confidence interval indicates how much the research data may deviate from reality. In the current study, with a 95% \nconfidence level, the maximum error (confidence interval) is +/- 5,1%.\nThe sample (thus the survey) does not represent the overall market but rather the segment of \nthose who intend to purchase an IOS device\n", "type": "Document"}}
