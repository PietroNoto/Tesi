The linear regression requirement is that a linear relationship exists between the \nvariables so that this relationship can be explained with a straight line.\nThe linear regression allows to understand the intensity of the relationship between the independent and the dependent variables and to what extent each factor affects the overall \nsatisfaction. The linear regression model shows a value \u201cR2=0,777\u201d (R-squared), this means that about 78% of the satisfaction is explained by this model. \nOWNERS SAMPLE\nOVERALL \nSATISFACTION\n22%\nCustomer support services \n46%\nProduct quality\nRunning cost\n19%\nTraining\n14%\n", "type": "Document"}}
