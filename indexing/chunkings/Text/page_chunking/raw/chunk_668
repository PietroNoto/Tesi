According to the results, the reputation lies at the \nheart of reliability and the second factor\nFactor 2 (LEADERSHIP): the second factor is closely linked to the \nleadership of the brand from an awareness point of view. However, \nthis factor totally lacks of objective elements related to product or \nservice performance.\nFactor 3 (NEARNESS): it includes items related to the company's \ncloseness to the technician / dentist and its ability to facilitate the \ndaily practice and provide a good service as a whole. This is a distinct \nfactor in the minds of the interviewees and it is also a component of \nthe more general concept of quality.\nCLINIC+LABO\nRELIABILITY\nLEADERSHIP\nNEARNESS\nTrustworthy\n0,794 \nReliable\n0,735 \nRecommendable to colleagues\n0,734 \nInnovative and at the forefront\n0,656 \nHighly reputable\n0,619 \n0,571 \nWorldwide reknown\n0,882 \nLeading company\n0,729 \nMakes daily practice easier\n0,867 \nCustomer service oriented\n0,561 \nFACTOR ANALYSIS\nThe factor analysis\u2019 main purpose is to summarize the information of several items \ncontained in a questionnaire results into few, synthetic  factors. The main goal is to \nfind out an underlying structure to a set of observed variables summarizing it in a \nsmaller number of latent variables.\nThanks to the factor analysis, some perceived image drivers are identified with \nregard to the known brands in the CAD-CAM digital world.\n59\nIn order to better understand the main positioning drivers in the \ntarget's imagery, a three-factor reduction of all the investigated \nitems was carried out, with the aim of summarizing and explaining \nhow this phenomenon is perceived in the sample imagery.\nIn general, the analysis shows a profound difference in the brand perception between the two different targets (dentists and dental technicians). The first ones \nare mostly in an initial phase of approach to the market, with a still very low incidence of users, and recognize to the brands elements linked to the image \n(leadership) above all. On the contrary, dental technicians, with a user rate of around 50%, prefer to mention and value practical elements of product reliability \nand close relationship.\n", "type": "Document"}}
