With specific regard to the dentists, the \nmost used way to provide digital restorations is to send impressions to a third party to produce the \ndigital restorations.  \nHowever, according to the opinion of all respondents, the digital technologies will have a relevant role \nin the future of prosthetics, despite some grade of discomfort, mostly due to the lack of information \nand training. By looking at the most relevant features required by a digital technology provider, the \n(economic) convenience appears to be one of the most important factors to work on, in order to speed \nup the propagation of the new technologies. \nThe UK and Germany represent two opposite situations, where UK shows a lower than average \npenetration in the use of digital technologies and Germany shows a rather higher than average \npercentage. However, German respondents seem to be rather conservative, as both, dentists and \ntechnicians show higher penetration rates, but still are the respondents who feel more uncomfortable \nwith the technology. \nIt is interesting to evaluate the position of Spain, Italy and France as countries that they firmly believe \nthe digital technologies are the future of prosthetics and foresee a future tightening of the relationship \nwith the industry due to the increase in the demand for case specific manufactured products. \n \n \n \n", "type": "Document"}}
