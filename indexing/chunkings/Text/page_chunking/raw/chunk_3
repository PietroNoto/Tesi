The fieldwork has been carried out from March to April 2023. \nWith a confidence level of 95% the maximum error (confidence interval) is +/- 2,9%.\nThe data was processed using EXCEL, R. \nThe data have been processed with the most suitable and advanced statistical techniques.\nGLOSSARY \nThe confidence level tells how sure the results can be. It is expressed as a percentage and represents how often the true\npercentage of the population who would pick an answer lies within the confidence interval. The 95% confidence level means \nyou can be 95% certain. \nThe confidence interval indicates how much the research data diverge from reality. As the sample results, even if \nrepresentative, cannot be perfectly correspondent to those obtainable interviewing the entire population, each research has \nan approximation degree which represents the maximum error of the research. For example, a confidence interval of \u00b1 3% \nindicates that if the research result is equal to 60%, the result can change, in comparison with reality, of an extra 3% or a minus \n3% and in this way it is included between 63% (60%+3%) and 57% (60%-3%).\nSTATISTICAL NOTE\n3\n3\n", "type": "Document"}}
