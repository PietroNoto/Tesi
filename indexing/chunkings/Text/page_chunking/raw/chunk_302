The items have a different meaning according to the point of view with which they are \nconsidered: the satisfaction related to the whole market or the satisfaction related to a single \nproduct/brand.\nSatisfaction related to a specific company/product\nHere the scheme is the same, but we can highlight the strength points in the upper-right side of \nthe map, which can determine inefficiency or low differentiation if placed in the left side of the \nmap. In the lower-right we can note an improvement area, where we can find the weak points \nof a certain company.\nSatisfaction related to the whole market\nHere we can highlight some prerequisites (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the \ncompetitors satisfy the market), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, \nwhere companies are not always able to satisfy customers with regard to strategic issues), and \nindifference areas (lower-left side of the map) which become waste/not efficient areas when a \ncompany decides to invest in those items belonging to the upper-left side of the map since, \nthey tends to satisfy the market but they actually don\u2019t affect the overall satisfaction at all.\n", "type": "Document"}}
