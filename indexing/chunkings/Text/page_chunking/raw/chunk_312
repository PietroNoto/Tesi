The report aims \nto highlight the information about how dentists and dental technicians are dealing with the new dental \ndigital technologies in Europe. The goal is to understand the key aspects of the role of these new \ntechnologies in the offices and laboratories daily work and how the respondents feel about the digital \ndentistry today. \n \nIntroduction \nThe first digital revolution in the dental market took place years ago with dental restorations such as \nveneers, inlays, crowns and bridges using dental CAD-CAM systems and new, improved systems appear \non the market at very high growth rates. The dentistry market is currently experiencing a very exciting \ntime for both dental practices, laboratory owners and professionals. New digital technologies, even if \nyet way behind compared with other areas such as engineering, medicine, biomedical, and others in \nterms of technologies, are being developed by the main manufacturers of the dental industry. The \ndevelopment of the digital technologies applied in dentistry will simplify the workflows and take the \nindustry - that formerly existed on a purely analog environment - on another level in terms of \nproduction and automation. \nAs the cost of a partner laboratory work is one of the major factor in dentistry, some partner\u2019s \nlaboratories and milling centers are adopting digital technologies in order to reduce costs and set \nthemselves to another level of quality. In other hand, as laboratories and milling centers keep improving \npractices and procedures, the main manufacturers also keep investing in research and developing the \nnext generation of products, systems, and technologies to meet the expectations and needs of the \ncustomers. \n \n \n \n \nThis report and the information contained therein are believed to be accurate at the time of publishing.
