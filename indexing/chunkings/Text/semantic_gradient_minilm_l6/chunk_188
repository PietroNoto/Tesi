base: 588 cases (whole sample) 36 the comparison between the \"unaided awareness\" and the \"top of mind\", highlights relevant differences in the prominence index: a higher index value indicates the brand's ability to represent a product family. example: 3shape is known by 14% of the respondents as a brand and 55% of those who know this brand have mentioned it as the first one. trend analysis digital equipment brands: unaided awareness 37 spontaneous awareness (unaided): it represents the entire group of brands of a certain product family, recalled by the interviewed sample. within the boundaries of spontaneous awareness, the consumer reasonably decides to make a purchase. top of mind: it represents the number of times a certain brand was mentioned as the first one by a respondent. due to the reduced number of cases of year 2015, this comparison is meant to be taken as an indication only. 3shape shows a reduced awareness level, but still is the leading brand. dentsply sirona resulted to be less mentioned as well, while 3m moves at the bottom of the ranking. besides, new competitors are growing, such as exocad, zirkonzahn and roland. unaided awareness top of mind overlap index: 1,59 1,31 (588 cases) (39 cases) digital equipment brands: unaided awareness vs. prominence index map thinking about the equipment to produce restorations/prosthesis with digital workflow (such as scanners, cad-cam, 3d printing, etc.), what brands come to your mind? high quantity of awareness with less immediate association to the product category high quantity of awareness with high immediate association to the product category the map puts into relation the quantitative data (unaided awareness) with a qualitative index meaning the brand attitude to be promptly associated to the product category (prominence). in the upper right side of the map there are brands with above the average unaided awareness and a higher ability to be immediately associated to the product category. 3shape is the brand that is more associated with digital workflow equipment, followed by exocad. other brands like zirkonzahn and ivoclar vivadent show a lower unaided awareness, but a higher prominence index, so that they are more often considered to be representative of this category by the respondents who have mentioned them. 38 unaided awareness + prominence + digital equipment brands: total awareness for each of the following brands, please state if you know it. base: 588 cases (whole sample) 39 total awareness represents a consolidation between aided awareness and unaided awareness. it is interesting to notice that some brands like kavo, ivoclar vivadent and bego show a high percentages of quotes related to the awareness due to other product categories. zirkonzahn, dentsply sirona and 3shape show among the highest values of awareness related to the manufacturing of cad-cam equipment. digital equipment brands: total awareness in digital segment for each of the following brands, please state if you know it (as a cad-cam manufacturer). base: 588 cases (whole sample) 40 the relevance index is important because highlights the capability of a brand to be recalled spontaneously to mind by respondents, thus potentially, when they need to take a decision for purchase. it is interesting to note the quite high total awareness of brands like zirkonzahn, dentsply sirona and 3shape, which show a very high total awareness in the digital segment. - total awareness digital + relevance + digital equipment brands: total awareness vs. relevance map for each of the following brands, please state if you know it (as a cad-cam manufacturer). base: 588 cases (whole sample) 41 the map showing the total awareness and the relevance highlights that 3shape, while not having the highest total awareness value, is the brand showing the highest ratio between the total digital awareness and the unaided awareness. zirkonzahn and dentsply sirona show a higher total awareness value, but less frequently are mentioned in a spontaneous way. other cad-cam specific brands such as roland and open technologies, while being less known, show higher values of relevance. digital equipment brands: total awareness vs. total awareness digital map for each of the following brands, please state if you know it. base: 588 cases (whole sample) 42 the map shows on the vertical axis the total awareness generally speaking, not strictly related to the digital segment, while on the horizontal one there is the ratio between the total awareness broadly speaking and the total awareness focused on the digital segment. the results show some brands whose total awareness in the digital segment has a high weight on their total awareness broadly speaking. this is true for those brand traditionally related to the digital world (right portion of the map), like zirzonzahn and 3shape. for other ones, such as kavo, ivoclar vivadent and bego, the incidence of the total awareness in the digital segment is lower than average. - total awareness + incidence total awareness digital on total awareness + brand positioning items score brand positioning: overall brands with regard to the brands that im going to read, could you tell me please what is your opinion about the following statements?

overall brands 53 the charts show the weight that the items evaluated have on the propensity to recommend a given brand, and on the right, their individual score. trust, reliability, and customer orientation are the items showing the highest correlation with the recommendation. regarding the items related to the pricing, it seems like if a brand is affordable, this characteristic has a remarkable impact on the recommendation, but when the price rises, it loses its impact and other items affect more the propensity to recommend a brand. items importance average score brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis map 54 how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? overall brands the map is the visual result of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. on the horizontal axis there is the weight on the recommendation of each item, and on the vertical axis is the average score of each item. the items are arranged on the map in a way as that at the top right are the items that are very important to the recommendation and that received a high score. at the bottom right there are the items very relevant to the recommendation but with a lower than average score. this map shows the items evaluated in overall and serves as a reference for the comparison with the performance of each brand. (low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) prerequisites waste/inefficiency indifference key success factors its interesting to note that customer service oriented and affordable are important items in the definition of the recommendation, but they received lower than average scores, and they are positioned in the key success factors. brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis 55 items importance average score how much are worth the single items on the recommendation?

zirkonzahn 57 items importance average score apart from reliability and trust, the ability to be an innovative and highly reputable brand seems to be important, in the perception of zirkonzahn, for the construction of the recommendation. not significant (low) items score (high) waste/inefficiency indifference strength points critical area for improvement (low) weight on recommendation (high) brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis map how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? zirkonzahn 58 the map is the visual result of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. on the horizontal axis there is the weight on the recommendation of each item, and on the vertical axis is the average score of each item. the items are arranged on the map in a way as that at the top right are the items that are very important to the recommendation and that received a high score. at the bottom right there are the items very relevant to the recommendation but with a lower than average score. there is only one item clearly in the critical area: customer service oriented. however, it is worth to note that trustworthy and reliable, the most important items in the construction of the recommendation in zirkonzahn model, are very close to this area. brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? exocad 59 items importance average score for exocad, the items related to price have less impact on the recommendation, while being a worldwide renown company is the most relevant feature in its recommendation model. however, the correlation analysis shows that several items seem to have a high weight on the recommendation. not significant not significant (low) items score (high) waste/inefficiency indifference strength points critical area for improvement (low) weight on recommendation (high) brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis map how much are worth the single items on the recommendation?

dentsply sirona 61 items importance average score its interesting to note that in dentsply sirona correlation analysis model, a good price quality ratio belongs to the most relevant items in the definition of the recommendation. the fact that even the item affordable is present among the most important ones, leave room to think that the price factor becomes important, in the brand perception of dentsply sirona, for the definition of the recommendation. not significant brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis map how much are worth the single items on the recommendation?
