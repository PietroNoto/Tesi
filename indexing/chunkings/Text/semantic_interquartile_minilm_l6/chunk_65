(15% vs 7% overall). key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 20 digital technology acceptance in dental laboratories stance versus digital technologies at this stage, the level of acceptance of the digital technologies was evaluated, with specific regard to how much the technicians feel comfortable with the new technologies. chart laboratories stance to digital technologies europe vs. breakdown per country there is a relevant difference between dentists and technicians, as the former mostly think that it is necessary to get closer to digital technologies because they are the future, while the latter clearly state to be comfortable in using it (42% overall). only 21% stated to feel uncomfortable. much lower than the result of the clinical sample (21% vs 38% of the clinical sample). germany stands out with its positive stance versus the digital technologies. the majority of the respondents in the other countries (france and uk on top) is getting closer to the digital technologies, typical of the development phase of a new market. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 21 relationship among dentists, technicians and the industry in the future of digital technologies chart change in the relationship among dentists, technicians and the industry europe vs. breakdown per country while the most quoted answer is, in overall, the same seen in the clinical sample (the relationship with the industry will become tighter) unlike it happened with the dentists sample, the second most quoted answer is that the relationship with the technicians will become blander, due to the fact that dentists are not required to get specific expertise about cad processing. this clearly is the technicians point of view, perhaps, this is affected by the worries that the chairside cad-cam may replace all or part of the activities once performed solely by the laboratories. in particular, italy and france show higher than average percentages for this option. while spain and germany give great importance to the strengthening of the relationship with the industry, the uk is higher than average in the statement related to the tightening of the relationship between dentists and technicians. required features from digital technology providers chart what technicians expect from a digital technology provider, in order to improve and enhance the way they perform restorations and prosthetics europe key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 22 basically, the conclusions about the required features from a digital technologies provider are on par with the dentists sample: convenience, training and information are the most mentioned ones. and the conclusions may well be the same: those elements could improve the users experience and attract new users, when the need for information and support is met. macro trends / scenario 3d printing this chapter analyses the awareness and the stance about the availability of 3d printing and in specific its availability in the dental sector. chart awareness of 3d digital printing - europe the awareness among dental practices clearly is different from the laboratories (82% vs 92%), nevertheless it can be considered very high in both cases. while in the clinical market there is no relevant difference among the countries, on the laboratory side the awareness is lower in italy, france and spain. the percentage of awareness is almost the same with regard to the availability of 3d printing in dentistry, but in this case, uk shows the lowest percentage of awareness both in the clinical and technical segments. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 23 chart most suitable indications for 3d printing - europe its interesting to note that the first mentioned indications quoted by the respondents are the same for both samples, but the third one in the clinical sample, surgical guides has been quoted as the first one in the technical sample. crowns & bridges look to be relevant in both samples. chart main consequences in dentistry brought by 3d printing - europe both samples agreed on the most relevant change brought by 3d printing in dentistry would be the increase in the kinds of materials available and of the digital procedures available. in comparison to the overall results there are no relevant differences among the evaluated countries. the reduction in the price of the restorations is not seen to be a major change. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 24 macro trends / scenario conclusions the penetration of the digital technologies is higher among the dental technicians than among the dental practices, especially in the use of digital equipment. with specific regard to the dentists, the most used way to provide digital restorations is to send impressions to a third party to produce the digital restorations. however, according to the opinion of all respondents, the digital technologies will have a relevant role in the future of prosthetics, despite some grade of discomfort, mostly due to the lack of information and training. by looking at the most relevant features required by a digital technology provider, the (economic) convenience appears to be one of the most important factors to work on, in order to speed up the propagation of the new technologies. the uk and germany represent two opposite situations, where uk shows a lower than average penetration in the use of digital technologies and germany shows a rather higher than average percentage. however, german respondents seem to be rather conservative, as both, dentists and technicians show higher penetration rates, but still are the respondents who feel more uncomfortable with the technology. it is interesting to evaluate the position of spain, italy and france as countries that they firmly believe the digital technologies are the future of prosthetics and foresee a future tightening of the relationship with the industry due to the increase in the demand for case specific manufactured products. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 25 brand awareness and positioning the analysis on digital technologies went deeper with the investigation of the main brands of this segment. in specific, the brand awareness focused on the most quoted brands. the unaided awareness has shown that, among dental practices, there are a few well-known brands whose performance is very high. on the other hand, when considering the technical market, the brands mentioned by the respondents are several, to testify that the digital technologies in the laboratory are a more mature market. chart unaided brand awareness- europe sirona and 3m are the brands to be mentioned among the most relevant ones in both samples, in particular, the former is among the top three brands in both samples. the laboratory market shows several brands whose longtime presence in the laboratory market is unquestionable, and the rather low number of brands mentioned by the clinical sample testifies the relatively young business. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 26 chart brand positioning, items average scores - europe when it comes to consider the brand positioning, it must be said that the relative scores quoted by both samples are rather consistent, showing almost the same behavior. both samples gave lower than average scores for the item too expensive, good price/quality ratio and affordable, while the performance of other items related to the brand reputation and reliability received higher scores. when considering the brands individually, in the clinical market, while sirona is rather on average, its interesting to note that kavo performed better than the competitors with regard to affordability and customer service oriented, while 3m is more than other brands associated with too expensive and worldwide renowned. on the technical side, it is worth to mention bego, which is higher than average in trustworthy, but far below for too expensive, and sirona, whose performance on affordability and customer service oriented, is not on par with the other brands. zirkonzahn showed higher scores for recommendation and innovation, while amann girrbach is higher than average in good price quality ratio. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 27 chart brand positioning, bivariate correlation analysis: weight of items on the recommendation - europe the bivariate correlation analysis takes into account the relative weight of the single items on a pre- determined dependent variable, which is the recommendation. its a useful analysis which goes beyond the plain and rational score given by the respondents, and tries to assess the actual importance of the different items on the recommendation. the charts show that, apart from the item trustworthy, whose importance is unquestionable, the main ones are rather different, according to the sample considered. among laboratories, given the relative longtime presence of this kind of technologies, the recommendation seems to be mostly affected by items related to the daily practice and innovation. on the clinical side, perhaps due to the fact that the market is less mature, some items strictly linked to the reputation prevail, as if the users, or the potential users, should be mostly concerned by the confidence in the brand first. affordability, for both samples, doesnt affect the recommendation at all.", "type": "Document"}}
