9 base: 588 cases (whole sample) 67% of the interviewed laboratories use a management software. the use is higher among younger technicians, in the most recent labs and in the largest ones. also among those technicians who perceive the future of the laboratory in a positive way, the use of these programs is more frequent. customized laboratory management software 38% of laboratories use a digital cloud. the majority of them use it to store the data (35%), followed by those who use it to exchange information with their clients (23%) and 19% who use it for other reasons. although the technical or laboratory profile changes slightly depending on the use they make of these technologies, it seems that their implementation prevails in laboratories in the north and between those with three or more employees. digital cloud for professional purposes do you use a digital cloud for professional purposes? 10 base: 588 cases (whole sample) customized digital cloud for professional purposes to store data to exchange data other purposes madrid center (23%) 1 technician (23%) 3 or more technicians (47%) monthly purchases <=500 (27%) madrid center (14%) north (34%) 1 technician (12%) 3 o ms tcnicos (32%) madrid center (10%) north (33%) 1 technician (6%) 3 or more technicians (27%) served practices <=5 (11%) served practices >10 (26%) macro trends the following analysis shows the perceived market trend stated by the interviewees. the resulting trend is a feeling of the interviewees, and it is not the result of a quantitative evaluation of the production. the psychological component may have, therefore, a strong influence on the results. business trend of the laboratory - past 12 months considering the overall business of your laboratory in the last 12 months, what was the trend compared to the previous period? base: 588 cases (whole sample) 12 the segmentation by geographic areas shows a quite heterogeneous situation with respect to the perceived trend, although the positive perception of those located in the madrid center area, is more statistically significant. it also seems that younger technicians seem to be more optimistic. finally, the analysis reveals that the most recent and larger laboratories more frequently claim to have had an increase in their business. business trend of the laboratory - expectations about the next 12 months what trend do you think will be, in your laboratory, in the next 12 months? 13 base: 588 cases (whole sample) 13 with regard to the expected future trend, once again young technicians are more optimistic than average, and so is for the most recent and largest laboratories. analysis of confidence perception of current situation vs. perception of the future base: 588 cases (whole sample) perception of current situation perception about the future in this section, a confidence index is shown, based on the evaluation of the responses. the method consist of a comparison between the perception of the situation over the last 12 months versus the forecast for the future. the chart on the left shows that the majority of the respondents perceive a stable situation (38%). however, 41% of respondents perceived an increase in their business, while about 20% perceived a decrease. in the future trend forecast, the majority of the responses are neutral, in fact, 54% foresee an unchanged situation, while 38% of respondents think that the future business will increase, while 7% states there will be a decrease. 14 analysis of confidence perception of current situation vs. perception of future situation base: 588 cases (whole sample) the answers regarding the current and future trend of the practice certainly are affected by the psychological component. in order to objectively assess the level of confidence in the future, it may be useful to put in relation the 2 variables. in fact, the answer it will remain stable does have a negative value if the respondent perceived a reduction, while it becomes a positive answer when the respondent experienced a development of the business. in order to obtain an unbiased confidence index, we assume that when the current situation is considered negative, the confidence index will be considered positive only when a consistent increase is the forecast for the future. vice versa, if theres a current positive situation, a stable forecast will be considered a positive forecast too. the model highlights a generalized optimism. 66% of the respondents shows a positive confidence index, 22% is neutral and 12% show a negative index. thus, the global index is positive (54%). 15 it will decrease a lot it will decrease slightly it will remain stable it will increase slightly it will increase a lot increased a lot 0,0% 0,1% 1,3% 2,6% 0,8% 33% 66% increased slightly 0,0% 0,2% 13,6% 22,7% 3,9% 33% stable 0,0% 0,7% 17,6% 18,6% 1,6% 22% 54% decreased slightly 0,1% 0,8% 8,5% 4,6% 0,8% 9% decreased a lot 0,3% 0,2% 1,1% 0,0% 0,0% 2% 12% future situation current situation analysis of confidence perception of current situation vs. perception of future situation base: 588 cases (whole sample) thanks to the cooperation with a psychologist expert in behavioral techniques and market dynamics, a socio-psychologic interpretation has been given to each cluster. therefore, the following interpretations can be presented. the overall confidence index is positive (54%). 16 the negatives : they experienced some decrease in their practice, somehow relevant, and they dont expect an improvement. they face the future challenges with frustration and impotence and its strong the feeling that the situation will not recover, or even expecting a further decrease. the optimists : they stated both an increase in the business of the practice or a surely stable situation. the positive cautious : they state a stable situation, and manage the business with a good portion of optimism and confidence in the future recovery. the neutral-confidents : they mostly show a stable situation. about the future, the prevalence is a stable condition. the moderate pessimists : the majority of them experienced a decrease in the number of patients and they foresee this situation to persist in the future, without exception. 12% 10% 8% 7% 6% 6% 5% 5% 4% 3% 3% 3% 3% 3% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 67% 11% 9% 8% 3% 4% 2% 4% 4% 1% 3% 1% 2% 1% 2% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 0% dental club new galletti&rossi henry schein nuova gerh revello astidental dental torino laboshop nordental master tecnik alegiani bixio dentale toscana elident blu dental group dentalcomm vs dental dentaurum metaldent alberti barca medical nobil metal altro non sa, non risponde numeric distribution top used pqi index dental dealers: numeric distribution what are your main suppliers in order of importance? base: 588 cases (whole sample) 17 the total sum of 237% (excluding dont know answers) demonstrates that spanish labs quote on average about 2,4 dealers as common suppliers. percentage of customers declaring to use a given product or dealer, not necessarily in an exclusive way. the question has a multiple choice answer. pqi index is the ratio between \"top used and overall penetration and actually indicates the quality of the penetration, or rather how many times, in percentage, a certain dealer has been used as the first/most important one among all dealers used by a respondent. in general, the fragmentation of the distribution is due to a strong presence of small local dealers working in small areas. dental dealers: numeric distribution what are your main suppliers in order of importance? the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. during the last years, proclinic and casa schmidt continue to maintain a leading position, although the \"followers\" garzn and dental everest are growing quite a lot. there is also an increase in the \"other\" category, which together with the increase in the overlap index, confirms the increased market fragmentation. 18 trend analysis 2018 2017 2016 2015 2013 2012 18-17 proclinic 46% 44% 37% 35% 26% 38% 2,7% casa schmidt 41% 50% 45% 37% 57% 59% 8,7% garzn 8% 6% 7% 7% 3% 5% 2,1% dental everest 7% 5% 5% 4% 2% 1% 1,9% labo shop 5% 8% 6% 4% 3% 5% 2,1% dt&shop 5% 7% 6% 6% 8% 9% 2,0% moltodent 5% 3% 2% 2% 1% 3% 2,1% dent-thel 4% 6% 5% 4% 1% 1% 1,8% henry schein 3% 1% 2% 1% 1% 2% 2,2% linerden 3% 2% 2% 2% 0% 0% 1,2% dentival 3% 4% 2% 3% 3% 4% 0,8% dental madrid 3% 2% 3% 2% 2% 4% 1,2% dentaurum 3% 3% 3% 5% 2% 2% 0,4% dental 7 3% 1% 1% 2% 1% 2% 1,7% proxdental asturias 3% 1% 1% 1% 0% 0% 1,3% bit dental 2% 4% 2% 1% 1% 0% 1,7% hiperdental 2% 2% 2% 1% 2% 2% 0,7% bnb 2% 0% 0% 2% 0% 2% 1,9% garcia torres 2% 4% 1% 0% 4% 2% 1,2% dentared / dentaltix 2% 5% 0% 0% 0% 0% 2,9% catalana dental 2% 1% 2% 2% 4% 5% 0,5% kedientes 2% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 2,0% jucadent 2% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1,3% other 77% 56% 60% 69% 72% 86% 21,5% overlap index 2,37 2,14 1,96 1,91 1,94 2,32 total (whole sample) 513 530 528 553 584 624 processing without \"don't know / no answer\" dental dealers: numeric distribution what are your main suppliers in order of importance?

base: 588 cases (whole sample) 20 scenario use of digital technologies in dental laboratories do you provide your customers with fixed prosthetics elements produced with digital technologies (also in full outsourcing)? base: 588 cases (whole sample) 22 percentage of laboratories 69% of the respondents declare to provide their clients with fixed prosthetics elements produced with digital technologies. when analyzing the evolution of the digital process, it emerges an increase that mainly affects the largest laboratories with a higher number of served practices. the use of digital technologies also is higher in the northeast and barcelona area (84%) and in the labs ran by younger owners (85%). it is also significant that the percentage increases (89%) among those declaring a very positive expected future trend and among those more inclined to use management technologies (79%) and the digital cloud (83%). cad-cam users 1 technician (45%) 3 or more technicians (83%) served practices <=5 (53%) served practices >10 (80%) the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. digital prosthesis provider 2015: 77 cases digital prosthesis provider role of digital technologies on prosthetics in the future how do you feel the new digital technologies (cad-cam and 3d printing) will affect the way the prosthetics is carried out in your country? base: 588 cases (whole sample) in comparison to the past edition, the percentage of users stating that digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics increased slightly. by deepening the analysis by segments, a significant difference emerges, between digital technologies users and providers of traditional prosthetics. besides this, its interesting to note the high percentage (63%), among the users of partner-lab channel for the production of digital prosthetic elements, for the statement digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. 23 2015: 77 cases 2015: 75 cases stance versus digital technologies what is your stance versus the digital technologies? base: 588 cases (whole sample) the situation changed a lot in comparison to 2015: the confidence in digital technologies increased considerably. it is more evident the difference in the stance versus digital technologies between those using it already and feeling comfortable. the difference is more evident when considering the comparison between full outsourcing digital prosthesis providers and the other digital prosthesis providers. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. 24 role of dentists and technicians in the future how do you think dentists and technicians role will change with the new digital technologies? base: 588 cases (whole sample) the perception about the evolution of the role of dentists and technicians changed as well, in comparison to year its interesting to note a higher percentage of quotes related to the need of cooperation between dentists and technicians, and this statement is true especially for the respondents providing digital prostheses already. among full outsourcing users, the percentage of those stating that there will be no change is remarkably higher. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. 25 2015: 76 cases required features from digital technology providers what should your digital technology provider offer you, to improve and enhance the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your laboratory? in comparison to 2015, training and information shows a relevant increase: those items are felt to be more and more important and functional to an effective approach to the digital technologies. a convenient price still is important but to a lesser extent.", "type": "Document"}}
