Product quality: the factor is characterized by those items that relate on one side to the practical usage of Cad-Cam and, on the other, the aspects of the \nsoftware and the ease of use of the interface. It partially includes the operating costs that are partially experienced as an integral part of quality.\n2. Customer support services : includes all aspects of the relationship between the company and the user regarding the technical service and after sales.\n3. Running cost: Refers to the aspects not related to the purchase cost but to the overall running costs for the use of the equipment and the software over \ntime.\n4. Training: the factor refers to the education and training of the dentist and the support in the use of the equipment after the purchase. \nOWNERS SAMPLE\nThe factor analysis is a multi-variate statistical \nanalysis used to investigate and give explanation of \nthe correlations among a given number of \nvariables. Thanks to a given number of known \nvariables (in this case the reasons to buy), the \nfactor analysis finds out some latent factors being \nable to statistically summarize the explicit variables.\n", "type": "Document"}}
