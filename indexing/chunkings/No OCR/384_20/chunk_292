This \nkind of analysis, has a relevant advantage: the here defined set of 2 \ndrivers allows to design a positioning map, explained by the following \nslide.\nFactor 1 (Nearness) it is driven by items like Affordability, Customer service \noriented, Makes daily practice easier, clearly related to the nearness, \nwhose concept is reinforced by Reliability and Good price quality ratio.\nFactor 2 (Reputation) it is driven by items clearly related to the reputation, \nsuch as Leading company and Worldwide renowned on top of all. Too \nexpensive may be part of the Reputation as brand with high reputation are \noften seen as more expensive than the average.\nFACTOR ANALYSIS\nIts goal is to reduce the information contained in several variables by synthesizing a few \nfactors. It aims to identify a substructure underlying a group of variables, and resume this \nsubstructure with a reduced number of latent variables.\nThanks to the factor analysis, some positioning drivers can be identified, that, as a matter of \nfact, represent the brand image analysed.\nTwo Factors\nNearness\nReputation\nAffordable\n0,764\nGood price quality ratio\n0,684\nCustomer Service oriented\n0,633\nMakes daily practice easier\n0,631\nReliable\n0,602\nTrustworthy\n0,589\n0,485\nLeading company\n0,800\nWorldwide renowned\n0,714\nInnovative and at the forefront\n0,628\nHighly reputable\n0", "type": "Document"}}
