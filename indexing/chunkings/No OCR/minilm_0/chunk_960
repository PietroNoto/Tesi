( scores from 1 \u201c definitely will not be using \u201d to 10 \u201c definitely will be using \u201d ) the possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores. the clustering is the following : \u25aa high risk : the scores grouped in this cluster are from 1 to 3. \u25aa medium risk : the scores grouped in this cluster are from 4 to 6. \u25aa low risk : the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to 10. the defection risk derives from the assumption that a low value of repurchase intention may mean a risk that in the future the product will not be used anymore. lower scores in the repurchase intention bear a higher defection risk, while higher scores mean that a current customer will probably still be using that product also in the future. mean : 6, 5 2015 : 25 cases mean : 7, 5 base : 30 cases the repurchase intention score highlights a remarkable decrease for the \u201c low risk \u201d cluster and a subsequently increase of the \u201c high risk \u201d and \u201c medium risk \u201d clusters. due to the lower number of cases, these figures should", "type": "Document"}}
