for all the investigated brands. however, the following can be noticed: due to the fact that the top three brands already had very high aided awareness in 2018, the increase in spontaneous awareness in the 2023 edition results in better relevance compared to the last edition. as observed for unaided awareness, the prominence value of dentsply sirona is on par with that of 3m. as for ivoclar, while its prominence value was similar to kerr in 2018, in this years edition is now significantly higher. note: the relevance index is important because highlights the capability of a brand to be recalled spontaneously to mind by respondents. base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) dental products in general: unaided awareness vs. total awareness map unaided: what company brands come to your mind,

represents those brands that have an above-average ability to be spontaneously remembered by respondents and are also mentioned more frequently than the average in aided awareness. the main differences compared to the 2018 map are that dentsply sirona now shares the same position as 3m. furthermore, while in the last edition the other brands appeared much distant from the two mentioned brands, the current map includes ivoclar, kerr, and gc in the same quadrant of 3m and dentsply sirona. ivoclar, in particular, shows a better positioning regarding both unaided and aided awareness.

that ivoclar has improved its performance, especially in terms of relevance. gc, in particular, stands out as it surpasses the 2018 results and performs above average in both the relevance and the prominence indexes. 23 the top-right quadrant highlights those brands that are more frequently remembered spontaneously by respondents (high relevance) and, due to a higher frequency as a top of mind, are better able than other brands to represent the product segment which they relates to (high prominence). key take aways 24 significant increase in the average number of brands mentioned. this generally results in a decrease in the prominence index, as with a greater number of brands mentioned, the probability of being mentioned as the first one decreases. in terms of overall brand awareness, dentsply sirona demonstrates a performance on par with 3m, thus no longer holding absolute leadership. furthermore, it is worth noting the increased overall brand awareness of ivoclar.

base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) attribute associations: summary 40 for each brand, the table summarizes to 100% the number of quotes received for the given attributes. it is not a frequency distribution among all brands, but for each brand, a frequency distribution of all attributes is shown. for example: out of 3m total quotes, scientific represents 9%. in dentsply sirona distribution, the attribute with the highest number of quotes is digital company, while for gc is excellent/the best. key take aways 41 in several cases, dentsply sirona is mentioned more frequently compared to various attributes, closely approaching - and in some cases surpassing - the performance of 3m. this is true, for example, for the attributes \"high reputation, \"innovative / cutting edge, flexible / versatile, young and modern. it is worth noting an improvement in ivoclar performance: \"innovative / cutting edge, \"friendly / intimate,\" and \"easy to use\" are some examples where the percentage of respondents mentioning this brand has significantly increased. there is an increase in brand awareness for companies in the digital world. although this may not be evident in overall brand awareness, it becomes clear when analyzing specific attributes. for example, align technology is mentioned in the attributes \"innovative / cutting edge,\" \"young and modern,\" and \"reliable.\" regarding digital brands, it is also worth highlighting their significant presence in the attribute \"innovative / cutting edge,\" a phenomenon not observed in a separate mention should be made for the attribute \"digital company\": apart from the obvious presence of brands in this area, it is interesting to note the clear positioning of dentsply sirona, which aligns well with the strategic change undertaken several years ago, making it the top brand mentioned in this context. key take aways 42 regarding the price positioning, there is a noticeable shift in dentsply sirona performance, as it not the first quoted brand anymore for the item very affordable\" while it is the first quoted one in the items more related to a premium price area. there is a significant improvement for ivoclar in the attribute \"ideal quality/price ratio,\" making it the third most mentioned brand in this edition after 3m and dentsply sirona. analyzing the frequency distributions of the items by individual brand, the following phenomena can be observed: for 3m, the item \"scientific\" is mentioned more frequently compared to \"high reputation\" in for dentsply sirona, the focus on the digital field is confirmed, but in terms of price, the most mentioned item is \"too expensive\" instead of \"good but expensive\" in for ivoclar, the scientific and innovative areas are mentioned more frequently, along with ease of use and flexibility. it is interesting to note the shift from \"good but expensive\" to \"ideal quality/price ratio.\" for kulzer, the most mentioned items are \"effective / concrete\" and \"flexible / versatile.\" correspondence analysis it is a descriptive statistical technique applicable to qualitative variables, whose purpose is to summarize and plot the relationships expressed by a frequency table. the analysis allows to represent as points of the same space (typically a plane) the considered variables, i.e. the rows and columns of the frequency table. with this system, the similarities / differences between rows and / or columns are processed respectively in proximity / distance of the points from one another. through the use of this statistical technique, it is possible to highlight the perception of the respondents and make a comparison among the brands under analysis. depending on the position of the attributes on the plan (active variables) and the proximity of the passive variables (represented by the brands), the perceived positioning in the imagery of the sample can be better understood. statistical note 43 correspondence analysis: positioning drivers 44 sustainable value and convenience this concept encompasses the effectiveness and practicality of the brand, social responsibility and environmental awareness, ease of use, flexibility and versatility, as well as a friendly and intimate approach in the customer experience. the perception is a convenient offering while respecting sustainability and user needs. those brands provide dentists with everything they need in a 360-degree approach. premium authority this definition summarizes the attributes present in this area: a high reputation based on a solid scientific foundation, excellence and superior quality, inspiring trust, a brands history and tradition. however, the attribute too expensive indicates that it may be considered a high-end or luxury brand with a higher price compared to the average. tech-forward leadership this area represents brands that stand out for their innovation, advanced digital presence, and the young and modern image they convey. these attributes indicate that the brand is at the forefront of new technologies, digitally oriented, and targeting a young and modern audience. tech- forward leadership emphasizes leadership in the technological field and the companys modern approach in providing innovative solutions. unlike the map proposed in 2018, the correspondence analysis in this edition does not clearly present two main axes. however, it is possible to identify certain positioning areas that are characterized by the presence of specific attributes that give rise to the names of these areas, as described below: correspondence analysis: positioning drivers 45 sustainable value and convenience premium authority tech-forward leadership correspondence analysis: complete map 46 correspondence analysis: brands only 47 sustainable value and convenience premium authority tech-forward leadership key take aways 48 first and foremost, it is interesting to note the positioning of orthodontic companies, which are primarily those belonging to the world of invisible aligner manufacturers. their positioning is perfectly compatible with the belonging area on this map. as observed in the past, catalog sales/mail-order businesses are positioned in the convenience area. straumann's positioning is heavily focused on performance, excellence, and the premium concept. it is noteworthy the positioning of dentsply sirona in the perception of dentists: it is close to the digital technology area but also relevant to the concept of being premium, as previously observed in the frequency distribution of attributes that have been analyzed. ivoclar and ultradent are positioned close to the concepts of effectiveness, practicality, and ease of use, with the brand gc being particularly close to the latter. kulzer's positioning is closely associated with the concepts of flexibility and versatility, voco with good value for money, and zhermack is closer to the convenience area. 49 brand image: items score brand positioning mean all brands (1.142 quotes) brand image: focus on brands - all brands in your opinion, how do you rate the mentioned brands in the following

brand positioning bivariate correlation analysis the bivariate correlation analysis is a technique that helps to identify and measure the influence of the independent variables (in this case, current users) on the dependent one (in this case, the recommendation). the bivariate correlation analysis has been used to quantify the relation between the score on the single items and the rating on the recommendation. therefore, it is possible to retrieve a hierarchy of importance from the individual statements and to display them in a chart, and then on a map. the vertical axis always shows the scores that the different items have received, on average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence on the recommendation. in this way, its obtained an estimated importance of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a bit different from the score explicitly stated. the analysis of the weight of each of the statements, and not only of the declared importance, allows for some interesting considerations. the items have a different meaning according to the point of view with which they are considered: statistical note recommendation related to the whole market here we can highlight some prerequisites (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors perform positively), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, where companies are not always able to meet the expectations with regard to strategic issues), and indifference areas (lower-left side of the map) which become waste/not efficient areas when a company decides to invest in those items belonging to the upper-left side of the map, since they show a lower weight on the recommendation. recommendation related to a specific company/product here the scheme is the same, but we can highlight the strength points in the upper-right side of the map, which can determine inefficiency or indifference if placed in the left side of the map. in the lower-right we can note an improvement area, where we can find the weak points of a certain company (higher than average item weight on the recommendation but lower than average item score). 63 items importance average score brand image vs recommendation: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? overall 64 the charts show the weight that the items evaluated have on the propensity to recommend a given brand, and on the right, their individual score. high quality, trust and innovation are the items showing the highest correlation with the recommendation. brand image vs

correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? dentsply sirona 69 focus on brands while it is true that the most significant items in determining the recommendation also receive ratings above the average, it is still interesting to note that customer orientation, which still holds above-average weight on the recommendation, does not receive ratings in line with
