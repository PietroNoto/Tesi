New digital technologies, even if \nyet way behind compared with other areas such as engineering, medicine, biomedical, and others in \nterms of technologies, are being developed by the main manufacturers of the dental industry. The \ndevelopment of the digital technologies applied in dentistry will simplify the workflows and take the \nindustry - that formerly existed on a purely analog environment - on another level in terms of \nproduction and automation. \nAs the cost of a partner laboratory work is one of the major factor in dentistry, some partner\u2019s \nlaboratories and milling centers are adopting digital technologies in order to reduce costs and set \nthemselves to another level of quality. In other hand, as laboratories and milling centers keep improving \npractices and procedures, the main manufacturers also keep investing in research and developing the \nnext generation of products, systems, and technologies to meet the expectations and needs of the \ncustomers. \n \n \n \n \nThis report and the information contained therein are believed to be accurate at the time of publishing.
