Nevertheless, this was enough to highlight Sirona dominant \nposition by a relevant margin. The analysis by country saw Sirona as the most mentioned brand \neverywhere and Planmeca as the main follower. \nWith regard to the sample of the laboratories, the most quoted brand was Amann Girrbach, followed \nby Zirkonzahn and Sirona. The analysis by country showed rather diverse situations: Amann Girrbach \nwas the first one only in Germany, while Sirona was the top brand in Italy and the UK. France saw \nZirkonzahn to be the most relevant one and in Spain the first one was Roland. Additionally, the analysis \non the dental laboratories also covered the numeric distribution of the manufacturers/milling centers \nused to send scan files or models. The most quoted one resulted to be Bego, followed by Heraeus \nKulzer, Dentsply-Atlantis, Nobel Biocare and CADdent.", "type": "Document"}}
