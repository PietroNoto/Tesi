Therefore, these factors are used as a basis for a further analysis, called \u201cMultiple regression \nanalysis\u201d that aims to understand how they explain the recommendation. The figure \"R2 = 0,645\" means that about 65% of the recommendation is explained and \nit is based on the given factors.\nThe overall model shows that the weight of the \u201cCustomer orientation\u201d factor is about 49%, therefore the importance of this factor is relevant. The second most \nimportant factor is the \u201cReputation\u201d and \u201cExpensiveness\u201d show the lowest weights.\nRECOMMENDATION\n(R2=0,645)\n57\n", "type": "Document"}}
