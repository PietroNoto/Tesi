This value should be \nconsidered as an indication only as the number of cases is very low, so is not statistically relevant. As \nan indication, the average number of technicians working at the practice - when this is the case - is not \nmuch different from the overall (1,4 UK vs 1,6 overall). \n \n \n \n", "type": "Document"}}
