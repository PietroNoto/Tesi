If we \nassume that the number of dental practices is a reliable indication \nof the weight of a given country, we need to make sure that each \ncountry\u2019s sample weights as much as the number of the surgeries \nfor that country, out of the total evaluated countries.\nIn this case, since the natural weight of the interviews in each \ncountry is different from the weight of the parameter considered, \nwe have to apply a multiplying factor (it can be more or less than \n1) to the number of performed interviews in each country, so that, \nonly for the overall results, the weighted interviews are consistent \nwith the parameter used.\nThe resulting number of weighted interviews is then shown at (C).\nIt is", "type": "Document"}}
