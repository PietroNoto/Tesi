6 macro trends / scenario dental practices this chapter analyses the dental practices statements about digital technologies, the offer in the clinics, the use, the acceptance and the impact in the results. also, the investigation took into consideration the feeling about the future development and attitude towards the digital technologies. the dental practices were invited to describe how they think the restoration results will change, about the future role of their job, the relationship with the technicians and the main players involved in the new technologies market. presence of dental technicians in the practice and partnership with laboratories technicians working at the dental office chart penetration of dental practices with technicians europe vs. breakdown per country as shown in the graphics, in germany the penetration of technicians in the lab is the highest in europe with 31% of the dental offices with at least one dental technician. followed by italy (9%) and france (7%). 5% only of uk practices state to have at least a technician working at the practice. this value should be considered as an indication only as the number of cases is very low, so is not statistically relevant. as an indication, the average number of technicians working at the practice - when this is the case - is not much different from the overall (1,4 uk vs 1,6 overall). key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 7 cooperation with external laboratories chart cooperation with external laboratories - europe vs. breakdown per country uk and spain are the countries that tend to be provided by more than one laboratory. this means that in those countries, the competition between laboratories can be higher or the laboratories are more specialized in certain types of treatments. use of digital technologies in practices indirect restorations performed with digital technologies chart digital technologies offer europe vs. breakdown per country analyzing the use of digital technologies and the european mean (32%), spain, italy and germany seem to be the countries where digital indirect restorations are performed the most. in other hand, in comparison to the european average, where 68% of the dental practices do not offer digital technologies, uk in specific looks to be an important exception, showing some resistance in the use of this kind of technology. at the same time, this topic can be regarded as a relevant development potential of the digital market in those countries. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 8 use of digital technologies breakdown by channel and technology in overall, for the remaining 32% of dental practices in europe offering digital restorations, they were invited to specify how they offer this service. chart use of digital technologies breakdown by channel the most frequent way to provide digital restorations is through partner laboratories, possibly located close to the practice, by sending them either the impressions or the scans. 16% of respondents send their impressions (or scans) to a manufacturer/milling center, while a relevant 14% of the sample provides digital restorations through their own chairside-milling unit. chart use of digital technologies breakdown by channel europe vs. breakdown per country key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 9 with regard to the analysis by channels, spain and france show the highest percentages of use of the manufacturer/milling center as the preferred channel, while italy shows the highest percentage of respondents owning a chairside-milling unit. uk shows a higher than average percentage of respondents stating to use a chairside milling and so is for the respondents stating to send their impressions/scans to a manufacturer/milling center. this result may mean a higher use of more advanced technologies by uk dentists, besides the low sample. considering the reduced number of cases, this information can be only considered as an indication.", "type": "Document"}}
