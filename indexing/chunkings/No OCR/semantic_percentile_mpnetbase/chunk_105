among milling systems users, the most quoted brand is by far dentsply sirona. when a milling unit is present in the practice, the production of cad-cam indirect restorations is quite high, accounting for slightly less than 50% of the total produced indirect restorations. the chairside milling penetration is higher in germany for historical reasons (in the past, the licensing of dental technicians to practise dentistry has been promoted), while it is less developed in spain, due to regulatory barriers (it is forbidden to have an in-house laboratory). indirect restorations average production*: 49% considering only the single indirect restorations (single crowns, inlays, onlays, veneers) what percentage do you produce them directly with your chairside milling system?

29 past surveys carried out by key-stone on 3d printing suggest a quick development of the adoption of this technology in dental practices. as regards the analysis on the year of purchase, especially in more recent years a high procurement activity has been made. it is worth to underline the higher-than-average penetration in germany and uk, while a lower-than-average intention to buy can be noted in italy and france. sales of 3d printers have shown a steep increase in recent years (75% of purchases have been made since 2019), mainly due to improvements in precision, production times and function of use. clinic year of purchase average: 2019 base: 1.061 cases until a few years ago 3d printers were used exclusively for printing individual impression trays and surgical guides; now they are also quoted to be used for printing temporaries and the production of the surgical guides has increased considerably; in addition, some models are capable of processing zirconia or lithium disilicate, thus potentially competing with milling units in the future. germany france italy spain uk yes, and we use it often 13% 2% 4% 5% 16% yes, but we rarely use it 5% 3% 6% 4% 6% no, but we plan to buy it 27% 19% 0% 26% 20% no, and we don't plan to buy it 13% 2% 2% 2% 1% no, and we don't know if we will buy it 43% 74% 88% 62% 57% cases 256 224 200 201 180 3d printers brands what are the brand and the year of purchase of your 3d printer? 30 base: 1.061 cases as regards the indications for use of the 3d printers, past surveys also indicate a slight shift in the procedures: while a few years ago the most suitable indication was related to temporary c&b, today the most quoted production procedure is surgical guides, followed by aligners. among practices equipped with a 3d printer, formlabs is the leading brand in penetration, followed by anycubic. as regards the use of the machines, it seems that in germany, and partially in the uk, there is a more transversal use across all applications. in italy and spain, the technology is mainly used for the fabrication of surgical guides and temporary elements. it is worth mentioning that in these two countries in 2018, the 3d printer penetration in dental practices was around 1%. what are the main processes you carry out with the 3d printer you have in your clinic?

cad-cam milling unit penetration: 53% intention to buy: 13% desktop scanner penetration: 81% intention to buy: 6% 3d printer penetration: 66% intention to buy: 15% labo desktop scanners are the cad-cam technology that first entered the laboratory and therefore they have the highest penetration rate. 3d printers have been in use in laboratories in more recent years but show a faster growth rate as they require a significantly lower financial investment. when analyzing the results, it should be considered that the analysis has been carried out in laboratories that produce fixed prostheses, thus the penetration shown in the charts might be slightly higher. base: 594 cases 137 114 125 113 105 137 114 125 113 105 137 114 125 113 105 desktop scanner brands is your lab equipped with a desktop scanner?", "type": "Document"}}
