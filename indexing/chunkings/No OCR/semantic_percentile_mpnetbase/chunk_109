(open answer, not consolidated) labo base: 594 cases learning new techniques and digital workflow are the most sought-after topics. digital workflow and techniques for using cad-cam are among the main topics researched in the courses, along with improving knowledge of new techniques and materials. *big labs with more than 15 technicians employed all big labs * de fr it es uk procedures new techniques and materials 24% 4% 31% 19% 31% 15% 21% cad-cam techniques and methods 14% 19% 11% 11% 10% 14% 20% cad design 13% 17% 13% 25% 17% 10% 0% digital workflow in general 13% 5% 12% 9% 12% 13% 15% in-depth knowledge of the software / equipment 12% 3% 13% 5% 6% 16% 16% 3d printing techniques and materials 5% 15% 5% 10% 3% 3% 3% improvement of the productivity 5% 12% 6% 2% 0% 6% 8% business / marketing management 3% 11% 1% 2% 6% 3% 2% customized training for my lab 3% 6% 3% 0% 0% 4% 7% live demo/hands on 1% 6% 2% 0% 0% 3% 0% other 2% 1% 0% 1% 4% 1% don't know / no answer 6% 2% 11% 6% 6% 3% nothing 4% 4% 1% 6% 6% 4% 2% time and money per year to dedicate to education 48 how much time are you willing to dedicate to your own and your staff education (number of days per year)? how much money are you willing to spend (per year) on your own and your staff education? 13,3 10,9 11,4 13,4 11,2 2.252 1.850 1.353 1.626 1.633 average number of days per year 12,1 expected average budget per year average number of technicians 5,4 7,5 5,3 3,3 4,4 6,1 the original answer regards the total number of days per year for laboratory staff. the data on the average number of technicians in the laboratory has been added later to derive the number of hours per capita to be spent on training. while the overall total number of hours is not very different between countries, introducing the average number of technicians, it can be seen that the hours per capita are lower in countries where there is a higher density of technicians per laboratory, while they are higher where the number of technicians per laboratory is lower. spain and italy are still the least digitized countries, but they are growing rapidly: more training and education needs are present. average number of days / technician / year 2,2 1,8 2,1 3,5 3,0 1,8 labo base: 594 cases cases 137 114 125 113 105 italy: torino - roma +39 011 3119430 +39 011 3118669 www.key-stone.it key-stone@key-stone.it powered by", "type": "Document"}}
