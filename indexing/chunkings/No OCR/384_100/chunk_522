We are now in the phase where both the number of users is steadily \nincreasing and sales of additional machines in already digitalised practices are being recorded. \nThe market is in a full development phase, with more than 20% of clinics already using IOS, and  \npenetration growing rapidly over time.\nWhen about half of the potential market (about 80% of clinics) is covered (i.e., about 40% of clinics is \ndigitalised), the weight of sales of replacement units will start to increase (also taking into account that \nthe average obsolescence of models is about 7 years). This moment will represent the trade-off of the \nmarket, which will develop at a slower pace with an increase in the weight of the software component \non the total business.\nCLINIC\nBase: 1.061 cases\nGermany\nFrance\nItaly\nSpain\nUK\nYes, and we use it often\n22%\n17%\n24%\n20%\n20%\nYes, but we rarely use it\n7%\n2%\n3%\n3%\n7%\nNo, but we plan to buy it\n34%\n44%\n41%\n53%\n29%\nNo, and we don't plan to buy it\n36%\n", "type": "Document"}}
