The bivariate correlation analysis has been used to quantify the relation between the score \non the single items and the rating on the recommendation.\nTherefore, it is possible to retrieve a \u201chierarchy of importance\u201d from the individual statements and to display \nthem in a chart, and then on a map. The vertical axis always shows the scores that the different items have \nreceived, on average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence on the recommendation. In this way, its \nobtained an \u201cestimated importance\u201d of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a bit different \nfrom the one explicitly stated. The analysis of the weight of each of the factors, and not only of the declared \nimportance, allows for some interesting considerations. The items have a different meaning according to the \npoint of view with which they are considered:\nSTATISTICAL NOTE\n\u25aa\nRecommendation related to the whole market\nHere we can highlight some prerequisites (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors \nperform positively), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, where companies are not \nalways able to meet the expectations with regard to strategic issues), and indifference areas (lower-left side \nof the map) which become waste/not efficient areas when a company decides to invest in those items \nbelonging to the upper-left side of the map, since they show a lower weight on the recommendation.\n\u25aa\nRecommendation  related to a specific company/product\nHere the", "type": "Document"}}
