In specific regard to this statement, the \npercentage (70%) is higher than dental practices (54%). Interesting the position of UK, different from the other countries, where a more relevant \npart of respondents believe that digital technologies will not have a relevant role.\nClearly the German market, given its weight, influences the overall \nresults, but it\u2019s interesting to note how the most mature market \nregarding digital technologies, the German one, believes the new \ntechnologies will have a relevant role, nevertheless, the traditional \nprosthetics will be relevant in the future anyway. \n", "type": "Document"}}
