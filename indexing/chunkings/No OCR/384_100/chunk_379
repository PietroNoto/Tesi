Both factor analyses worked at their best \nwhen the output consisted in two factors, whose meaning and names have been the same for both \ngroups. The first factor was \u201cNearness\u201d and the second one was \u201cReputation\u201d. Even though the driving \nitems are not exactly the same, both analysis may have the same meaning: \u201cNearness\u201d is the factor \ndriven by items clearly related to the close relationship that a company may show, like customer \nservice, affordability, reliability, while the second factor named \u201cReputation\u201d is made up of items in \nclose relation to the image and reputation of a brand. \nChart 31. Brand positioning, Factor analysis map - Europe \n \nDespite the factor analysis showed the same factors for both groups, the positioning maps had rather \ndifferent results. The map of the dental practices sample was clearly influenced by the high weight of \nSirona in the analysis, whose position was in the middle of the map. A bit more scattered the map of \nthe sample made up of dental laboratories. In the analysis on the laboratories, Sirona has no central \nposition and its brand image looks not to be related neither to the Nearness, nor to the Reputation. \nKavo brand image looks to be almost the same in both analysis, that is, more linked to the Nearness \nand on average with regard to the Reputation. Other relevant topics worth to be mentioned are the \nposition of Dentsply in the analysis on the dental practices, very much related to", "type": "Document"}}
