Only in some clusters like Dentsply brand, the Nearness seems to have a \nhigher weight in determining the recommendation.\nMULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS\nThe regression analysis is a multi-variate statistical technique whose main aim is to find out the existing relationship between a target variable (dependent variable, in our case, the \nrecommendation) and a group of independent variables (each single factor derived from the factor analysis).\nOne of the main focus of the multiple regression is to assess how much part of the dependent variable (recommendation) is explained by the independent variables (corner stone \nfactors of the recommendation which have been previously indicated: Nearness, Reputation), i.e. how much these factors are influencing the behavior of the dependent one.\n", "type": "Document"}}
