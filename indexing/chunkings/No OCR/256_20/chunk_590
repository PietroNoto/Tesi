In this case, the items showing the highest weights on the \nsatisfaction are two: \u201cProduct quality\u201d and \u201cSupport and assistance\u201d. It will be interesting to see if the same weight on the overall satisfaction is shown in the analysis \nperformed on the single brands.\nThe other factors are the same of the analysis performed on dental practices. \u201cManagement costs\u201d and \u201cCompatibility\u201d again shows almost the same weight (18% the former, \n17% the latter).\n(R2=0,777)\nOVERALL\nSATISFACTION\n32%\n18%\nProduct quality\nManagement", "type": "Document"}}
