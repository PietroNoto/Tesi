The clustering is the following:\n\u25aa\nHigh Risk: the scores grouped in this \ncluster are from 1 to 3.\n\u25aa\nMedium Risk: the scores grouped in this \ncluster are from 4 to 6.\n\u25aa\nLow Risk: the scores grouped in this \ncluster are from 7 to 10.\nThe defection risk derives from the \nassumption that a low value of repurchase \nintention may mean a risk that in the future \nthe product will not be used anymore. \nLower scores in the repurchase intention \nbear a higher defection risk, while higher \nscores mean that a current customer will \nprobably still be using that product also in \nthe future.\nMEAN", "type": "Document"}}
