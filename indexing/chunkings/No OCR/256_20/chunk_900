Therefore, these factors are used as a basis for a further analysis, called \u201cMultiple regression \nanalysis\u201d that aims to understand how they explain the overall satisfaction. The figure \"R2 = 0,629\" means that more than 60% of the total satisfaction is \nexplained and it is based on the given factors, which is a remarkable result.\nThe overall model shows that the weight of the \u201cPerformance\u201d factor is slightly less than 50%, therefore the importance of this factor is relevant. The second \nfactor is the \u201cRelationship and support\u201d, then \u201cOperating costs\u201d shows the lowest weight. It is interesting to look at the following slides, when the same analysis is \ncarried out on the single brands.\nOVERALL\nSATISFACTION\n(R2=0,629)\n45%\n22%\nPerformance\nOperating costs\n33%\nRelationship and support\nLABO\n", "type": "Document"}}
