If we assume \nthat the parameters considered (number of laboratories and Fast Track Europe* business) are a reliable \nindication of the weight of a given country, we need to make sure that each country\u2019s sample weights \nas much as the parameters indicated for that country, out of the total (number of laboratories and Fast \nTrack business) evaluated countries. \nIn this case, since the natural weight of the interviews in each country is different from the weight of \nthe parameters considered, we have to apply a multiplying factor (it can be more or less than 1) to the \nnumber of performed interviews in each country, so that, only for the overall results, the weighted \ninterviews are consistent with the parameters used. \nThe resulting number of weighted interviews is then shown at (C).  \n \nIt is important to underline that the weights are applied only when the overall results are considered.", "type": "Document"}}
