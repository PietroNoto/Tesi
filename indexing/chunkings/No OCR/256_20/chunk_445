Brand positioning, items average scores - Europe \nWhen it comes to consider the brand positioning, it must be said that the relative scores quoted by \nboth samples are rather consistent, showing almost the same behavior. Both samples gave lower than \naverage scores for the item \u201cToo expensive\u201d, \u201cGood price/quality ratio\u201d and \u201cAffordable\u201d, while the \nperformance of other items related to the brand reputation and reliability received higher scores. When \nconsidering the brands individually, in the clinical market, while Sirona is rather on average, it\u2019s \ninteresting to note that Kavo performed better than the competitors with regard to Affordability and \nCustomer service oriented, while 3M is more than other brands associated with Too expensive and \nWorldwide renowned. On the technical side, it is worth to mention Bego, which is higher than average \nin Trustworthy, but far below for Too expensive, and Sirona, whose performance on Affordability and \nCustomer service oriented, is not on par with the other brands.
