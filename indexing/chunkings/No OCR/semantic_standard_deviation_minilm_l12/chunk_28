and it is fully representative of the population of the laboratories in the investigated countries. the interviews were performed between july and september of 2015 through a cati system made by our team of specialists. 4 introduction the omnivision digital europe 2015 is an omnibus, multi-client descriptive research, analyzing the performances in europe of the main international manufacturers both in clinical and technical markets evaluated with regard to the new digital technologies, such as intraoral scanners, chairside milling, table top scanners, in lab milling and 3d printing. the number of interviews performed for the research is 722 dental laboratories; it results fully representative of the population of the european dental laboratories. with a confidence level of 95% the maximum error (confidence interval) is +/- 3,5%. the data was processed using excel, spss, statistica. due to the objectives of knowledge and the types of questions, the data was processed: contingency tables significance test glossary the confidence level indicates the reliability level of the research. for example, a confidence level equal to 95% means that the phenomenon pointed out by the research is correct for the 95% of the cases. the confidence interval indicates how much the research data diverge from reality. as the sample results, even if representative, cannot be perfectly correspondent to those obtainable interviewing the entire population, each research has an approximation degree which represents the maximum error of the research. for example, a confidence interval of 3% indicates that if the research phenomenon is equal to 60%, the result can change, in comparison with reality, of an extra 3% or a minus 3% and in this way it is included between 63% (60%+3%) and 57% (60%-3%). . 5 introduction - statistical note introduction - sample composition 1/2 6 country weighted cases % germany 366 51% france 98 14% italy 139 19% spain 77 11% united kingdom 42 6% total 722 100% the sample consists of 722 dental laboratories stratified by nielsen areas. the number of interviews conducted in each country were about 150 (increased in germany and slightly lowered in uk), but in order to accurately represent the market made up of the investigated countries, the cases have been properly weighted. the weight has been calculated by considering two main parameters. the number of dental laboratories the fast track analysis business its quite clear how relevant is the weight of germany in the dental lab market and in this research. please, refer to the next slide for the details of the weighting process. introduction - sample composition 2/2 7 country weighted cases % germany 366 51% france 98 14% italy 139 19% spain 77 11% united kingdom 42 6% total 722 100% the number of interviews conducted in each country were about 150 as shown here on the right (a). the average weight of the surveyed countries regarding 2 parameters: number of dental laboratories and business collected from a panel of major manufacturers in europe for the consumable market (the fast track analysis europe) is shown at (b). the overall results (only the overall ones) must be representative of the total universe (all countries investigated) which the sample refers to, as if we were to interview the whole universe. if we assume that the parameters considered (number of laboratories and fast track business) are a reliable indication of the weight of a given country, we need to make sure that each countrys sample weights as much as the parameters indicated for that country, out of the total (number of laboratories and fast track business) evaluated countries. in this case, since the natural weight of the interviews in each country is different from the weight of the parameters considered, we have to apply a multiplying factor (it can be more or less than 1) to the number of performed interviews in each country, so that, only for the overall results, the weighted interviews are consistent with the parameters used. the resulting number of weighted interviews is then shown at (c). it is important to underline that the weights are applied only when the overall results are considered. the charts showing the data of the single countries, are always referred to the actual interviews performed (a).
