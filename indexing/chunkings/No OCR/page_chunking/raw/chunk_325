Germany \nand Spain are the countries showing the highest percentages. Again, German laboratories are the ones \nproviding more often than others prostheses made with digital technologies: 37% of laboratories (vs. \n31% overall) provides this service on a regular basis. Like in all investigated countries, the percentage \nof laboratories providing digital restorations is higher than the percentage of practices doing so. Again \nthe percentage in UK is considerably lower than the overall result. \nChart 14.
