The data on the \naverage number of technicians in \nthe laboratory has been added later \nto derive the number of hours per \ncapita to be spent on training.\nWhile the overall total number of \nhours is not very different between \ncountries, introducing the average \nnumber of technicians, it can be \nseen that the hours per capita are \nlower in countries where there is a \nhigher density of technicians per \nlaboratory, while they are higher \nwhere the number of technicians \nper laboratory is lower. \nSpain and Italy are still the least \ndigitized countries, but they are \ngrowing rapidly:\nmore training and education needs \nare present.\nAverage number of days / technician / year\n2,2\n1,8\n2,1\n3,5\n3,0\n1,8\nLABO\nBase: 594 cases\nCases                 137                        114                         125                        113                  \n105\n", "type": "Document"}}
