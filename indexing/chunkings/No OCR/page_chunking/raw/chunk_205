This allowed for the \ndefinition of a statistically significant segment of 89 cases. During the \nanalysis, it was noted that Dentsply Sirona\u2019s customers (implants and \naligners) also represent a statistically significant segment, as do the 171 \nInvisalign users.\nThe segmentation questions conducted on the sample allowed for the \nidentification of customers from three companies, whose statistical \nrepresentativeness is considered sufficient to attempt to identify \npotential differences in purchase behavior perception. For convenience, \nthese three companies are referred to in the charts with the following \nabbreviations: Align Technologies (ALT), Straumann (STR), and \nDentsply Sirona (DS).\nThis segmentation explicitly excludes owners of Itero or Dentsply \nSirona scanners because the same parameter cannot be used for \nStraumann, which has not yet been mentioned as a scanner brand \n(the 39 Itero owners and 43 DS Scanner owners were nonetheless \nisolated for possible considerations).\n", "type": "Document"}}
