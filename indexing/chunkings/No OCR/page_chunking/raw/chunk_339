In specific, the investigation took into consideration the brands used for scanning and for \nmilling. \nChart 32. Equipment use: Scanners - Europe \nThe analysis proved that the penetration of this kind equipment varies widely, according to the sample \ntaken into consideration. The sample of dental practices made up of digital technologies users stated \nto use an intraoral scanner in 20% of the cases, while the corresponding sample of laboratories stated \nto use a scanner in 84% of the cases. For the former sample, the penetration of dental scanners related \nto those laboratories having a scanner for either sending outside scan files (in this case, the percentage \nis 55%) or to be used with an in-lab milling center. \nChart 33.
