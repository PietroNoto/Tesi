With this system, the similarities / differences between rows and / or columns are \nprocessed respectively in proximity / distance of the points from one another.\nThrough the use of this statistical technique, it is possible to highlight the perception of the respondents and make a \ncomparison among the brands under analysis.\nDepending on the position of the attributes on the plan (active variables) and the proximity of the passive variables \n(represented by the brands), the perceived positioning in the imagery of the sample can be better understood.\nSTATISTICAL NOTE\n43\n", "type": "Document"}}
