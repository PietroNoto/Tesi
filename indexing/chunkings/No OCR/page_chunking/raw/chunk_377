(Multiple answer)\n25\nBase: 722 cases\nAccording to the opinion of the respondents the main consequence brought by 3D printing is related to the wider range of materials available. \nThis is by far the most quoted one with 88% of \u201cYes\u201d, higher than the sample of dental practices. The least mentioned possible consequence \nbrought by 3D printing is a reduction in the costs of the restorations, which received only 45% of positive responses, not so far from the \nresults of the clinical sample (40%). It will be interesting to evaluate in the following slides, option by option, the different behaviour in the \nevaluated countries.\nA) The kind of materials and procedures produced digitally \nwill broaden (Kind of materials will broaden)\nB) The efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase\n(Efficiency/Flexibility will increase)\nC) The costs of the restorations will decrease because of the \nlower price of the materials used compared to the CAD-\nCAM blocks (Costs of restorations will decrease)\n", "type": "Document"}}
