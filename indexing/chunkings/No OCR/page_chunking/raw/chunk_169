It \nwas used to quantify the ratio between score and individual factors and evaluation over recommendation. \nTherefore, it is possible to retrieve an \"importance hierarchy\" of individual demonstrations and to show them \nin a chart and, then, in a map. The vertical axis always shows the rating that the different instructions have \nreceived, in an average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence over the global recommendation. Thus, \nwe get an \"estimated importance\" of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a little different of \nthat explicitly declared. The analysis of each factor's weigh, and not only the stated importance, allows some \ninteresting considerations. The items have a different meaning according with the viewpoint with which they \nare considered:\n56\nSTATISTICAL GRADE\n\u25aaRecommendation before the whole market:\nHere we can emphasize some prerequisites (each upper right corner of the map, where almost all the \ncompetitors are before the market), some key factors to success (lower right corner of the map, where the \ncompanies are not always able to be recommended regarding strategical matters), and indifference areas \n(lower left corner), that constitute waste/inefficiency areas when a company decides to invest in such items \nbelonging to the upper left corner of the map, since they are prone to meet the market, but they really do not \naffect the overall recommendation.\n\u25aaRecommendation regarding a specific company:\nHere the scheme is the same, but the strong points are highlighted in the upper right corner of the map, \nwhere we can establish the inefficiency or low differentiation when placed in the left side of the map. In the \nlower right corner we can notice an improvement area, where we can meet the weak points of a given \ncompany.\n", "type": "Document"}}
