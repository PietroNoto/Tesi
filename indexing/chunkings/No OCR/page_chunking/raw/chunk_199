Spain has a high proportion of intensive implant users, indicative of a well-\ndeveloped market. Although the sample of potential intraoral scanner buyers is not representative of the entire implantology market, it is useful for evaluating the value \nproposition of the new scanner compared to the leading brands.\nSample Segmentation: Aligners Users\nIn France, orthodontics, and specifically aligners, is a niche market due to regulatory factors. This data helps evaluate the use of aligners in Italy and Spain and is valuable \nfor analyzing related responses. Align Technology, Dentsply Sirona, and Straumann are key players in the scanner market, with their customers analyzed for differences in \npurchasing behavior and perception.\nNew prospects profile\nAmong potential buyers of intraoral scanners, nearly 40% are potential future owners, 45% are current owners looking to purchase another scanner, and 16% own \nmultiple scanners but plan to acquire more. In Spain, there is a higher proportion of non-owners considering a purchase (50%), while in Italy, there are more scanner \nowners among potential buyers. Non-owners are also more common among those over 54 years old and in smaller practices.\nSample Segmentation: Consumable Customers\nTo separately evaluate the results for Straumann customers, a statistically significant segment was created by grouping users of Straumann, Neodent, Anthogyr implants, \nand ClearCorrect. The analysis also revealed that customers of Dentsply Sirona (implants and aligners) and Invisalign users are statistically relevant segments. The sample \nsegmentation identified customers of three companies (Align Technologies, Straumann, and Dentsply Sirona) whose statistical representativeness is sufficient to analyze \npotential differences in purchasing behavior perception.\nDrivers of Choice\nThe most important factors in choosing an intraoral scanner include high reading accuracy, scan resolution, and affordable price. In France, economic accessibility is less of \na priority, but product training is highly valued. In Spain, affordability and flexible scanning are crucial, while wireless charging is appreciated in both Italy and France.\nCompatibility with Invisalign: Concerns and Priorities\nCompatibility with Invisalign has emerged as a significant concern in focus groups. Among the 15% who consider compatibility with aligners important, two-thirds \nspecifically value compatibility with Invisalign, indicating that 60% of those who view \"compatibility with clear aligners\" as important see it as a major issue. This translates \nto 9% of the overall sample. This concern is less pronounced in France due to a more specialized market, while in Italy and Spain, where the market is broader, the concern \nis around 9-10%. Among IOS owners, 10% consider compatibility with Invisalign crucial, compared to 7% of non-owners.\n", "type": "Document"}}
