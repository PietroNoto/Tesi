(multiple choice) training / education and support are most quoted needs for additional services. dedicated lab support is more often quoted by bigger sized labs (64%) and in general by labs receiving higher than average scan files from clients and those equipped with milling unit (59%). lab-to-doctor education support is more often quoted by labs attributing a high importance to training and education (44%), by those receiving high shares of models/impression works to digitize (48%) and by smaller sized labs (46%). access to restorative design services is more often quoted by labs receiving a higher share of scan files (37%) and those producing a higher number of ortho cases with aligners (37%). access to modelling and interpretation services are more often quoted by labs with higher share of clients sending scan files (34%) and by those performing higher production of ortho cases with aligners (41%). commercial partnership is more often quoted by labs with high share of clients sending scan files (33%) and those less involved in traditional techniques (31%). labo in the uk the issue of dedicated laboratory support and access to restorative design services are the most relevant. in some countries more elements are mentioned, for example in spain and italy both training and support in providing a synergistic training path between laboratory and clinic is very important. in fact, dentists often turn to the laboratory for guidance on digital flow management. base: 594 cases lab needs in terms of training importance of training and education 45 how do you rate the importance of training and education? mean: 4,5 importance of training / education is very high throughout, even more so in southern europe. training / education is higher than average very important among smaller labs (65%). and so is for less recently open labs (64%) and for those receiving a lower share of scan files (70%). again, it is higher than average very important for those who think that ios scans have had a positive impact on the laboratory business (62%). where digitalization rate is lower, the perception that training is very important increases (expansion phase). labo base: 594 cases cases 137 114 125 113 105 4,4 4,1 4,7 4,7 4,3 attended type of trainings 46 what types of trainings do you attend? how often (no. of days)? average days per year (base: respondents attending training events) almost all respondents attend training sessions. training penetration is over 90% in all countries, with peaks in uk and germany, where it is over 95%. training days dedicated to learning new techniques or training on sw and equipment are higher than lectures at industry events. bigger sized labs and those performing ortho cases with aligners do spend more days than average. more digitized labs are those spending higher than average days. smaller labs, being them also less digitized, spend less days a year. those considering digitization of the lab has an impact on the lab staff, are also spending more days than average on training. labo base: 594 cases 137 114 125 113 105 desired types of training 47 what types of trainings would you be interested in? (open answer, not consolidated) labo base: 594 cases learning new techniques and digital workflow are the most sought-after topics. digital workflow and techniques for using cad-cam are among the main topics researched in the courses, along with improving knowledge of new techniques and materials. *big labs with more than 15 technicians employed all big labs * de fr it es uk procedures new techniques and materials 24% 4% 31% 19% 31% 15% 21% cad-cam techniques and methods 14% 19% 11% 11% 10% 14% 20% cad design 13% 17% 13% 25% 17% 10% 0% digital workflow in general 13% 5% 12% 9% 12% 13% 15% in-depth knowledge of the software / equipment 12% 3% 13% 5% 6% 16% 16% 3d printing techniques and materials 5% 15% 5% 10% 3% 3% 3% improvement of the productivity 5% 12% 6% 2% 0% 6% 8% business / marketing management 3% 11% 1% 2% 6% 3% 2% customized training for my lab 3% 6% 3% 0% 0% 4% 7% live demo/hands on 1% 6% 2% 0% 0% 3% 0% other 2% 1% 0% 1% 4% 1% don't know / no answer 6% 2% 11% 6% 6% 3% nothing 4% 4% 1% 6% 6% 4% 2% time and money per year to dedicate to education 48 how much time are you willing to dedicate to your own and your staff education (number of days per year)? how much money are you willing to spend (per year) on your own and your staff education? 13,3 10,9 11,4 13,4 11,2 2.252 1.850 1.353 1.626 1.633 average number of days per year 12,1 expected average budget per year average number of technicians 5,4 7,5 5,3 3,3 4,4 6,1 the original answer regards the total number of days per year for laboratory staff. the data on the average number of technicians in the laboratory has been added later to derive the number of hours per capita to be spent on training. while the overall total number of hours is not very different between countries, introducing the average number of technicians, it can be seen that the hours per capita are lower in countries where there is a higher density of technicians per laboratory, while they are higher where the number of technicians per laboratory is lower. spain and italy are still the least digitized countries, but they are growing rapidly: more training and education needs are present. average number of days / technician / year 2,2 1,8 2,1 3,5 3,0 1,8 labo base: 594 cases cases 137 114 125 113 105 italy: torino - roma +39 011 3119430 +39 011 3118669 www.key-stone.it key-stone@key-stone.it powered by", "type": "Document"}}
