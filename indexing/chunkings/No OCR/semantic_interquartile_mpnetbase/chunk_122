38 labs digitization is considered to be very important. a lower importance is recorded for smaller labs, while the opposite is true for bigger sized labs. in addition, when training and education is considered very important, importance of digitization of the lab is high too (62%). moreover, among itero platform users and when lab business has increased, the opinion that importance of digitization of the lab is very high increases (59% and 63% respectively). even the interest in increasing the share of scans from dentists is high*: in overall 82% of interviewees are interested. the interest is lower for smaller labs (72% for yes). labo what impact do you feel the acceptance of the ios scans has had on your dental laboratory business? positive impact is widely quoted overall. again, smaller sized labs quote a lower-than-average positive impact (55%). respondents attributing a high importance to training and education do quote a more than average positive impact (73%). the same is for bigger sized labs (73%). in addition, labs performing ortho cases with aligners do feel more than average an overall positive impact (72%) and those performing a higher number of simple fixed prosthesis cases too (73%). *would you be interested in increasing the % of intra-oral scans received vs.", "type": "Document"}}
