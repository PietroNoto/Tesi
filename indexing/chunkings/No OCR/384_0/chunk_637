The bivariate correlation \nanalysis has been used to quantify the relation between the score on the single satisfaction items and the \nrating on the overall satisfaction.\nTherefore, it is possible to retrieve a \u201chierarchy of importance\u201d from the individual statements and to display \nthem in a chart, and then on a map. The vertical axis always shows the satisfaction ratings that the different \nfactors have received, on average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence on the overall satisfaction. In \nthis way, its obtained an \u201cestimated importance\u201d of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a \nbit different from the one explicitly stated. The analysis of the weight of each of the factors, and not only of \nthe declared importance, allows for some interesting considerations. The items have a different meaning \naccording to the point of view with which they are considered:\n63\nSTATISTICAL NOTE\n\u25aa\nSatisfaction related to the whole market\nHere, some prerequisites are highlighted (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors \nsatisfy the market), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, where companies are not \nalways able to satisfy customers with regard to strategic issues), and indifference areas (lower-left side of the \nmap) which become waste/not efficient areas when a company decides to invest in those items belonging to \nthe upper-left side of the map, since they tend to satisfy the market but they actually don\u2019t affect the overall \nsatisfaction at all.\n\u25aa\nSatisfaction related", "type": "Document"}}
