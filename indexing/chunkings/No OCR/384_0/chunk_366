On the \nother hand, with regard to the \u201cchannel\u201d users, out of the total \u201cPartner lab\u201d users (blue circled data, \nrespondents sending their models or scan files to a partner lab), 48% of them also send their models or \nscan files to a \u201cManufacturer/Milling center\u201d and 11% of them also have an in-lab milling.

Influence of digital technologies on prosthetics performance \u2013 Europe vs. breakdown per \ncountry \n \nThe approach of the laboratories is not very different from that of dental practices, as the majority of \nthe respondents state to believe the digital prosthetics will have a relevant role but the traditional \nprosthetics will be relevant in the future, too. In specific regard to this statement, the percentage (70%) \nis higher than that of the dental practices (54%). \nIn comparison to the overall result, clearly, the German market, given its weight, influences the overall \nresults, but it is interesting to note how the most mature market regarding digital technologies, the \nGerman one, believe the new technologies will have a relevant role, but the traditional prosthetics will \nbe relevant in the future anyway.
