It is worth to highlight that, apart the clear leading position of IPS e.max CAD, the other \nproducts, namely IPS Empress CAD, Lava Ultimate and Vita Enamic are very close one to each other. \nThe further data processing (chart 48 on the right) sums up to 100% all responses (thus becoming a \nsingle option question), and the numeric distribution has been then shown by number of responses. \nThe main information is the same seen on the left sided chart, that is, the predominance of Ivoclar \nVivadent products, according to the responses of the sample.
