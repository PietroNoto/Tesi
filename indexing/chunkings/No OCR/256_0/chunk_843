The main goal is to \nfind out an underlying structure to a set of observed variables summarizing it in a \nsmaller number of latent variables.\nThanks to the factor analysis, some perceived image drivers are identified with \nregard to the known brands in the CAD-CAM digital world.\n59\nIn order to better understand the main positioning drivers in the \ntarget's imagery, a three-factor reduction of all the investigated \nitems was carried out, with the aim of summarizing and explaining \nhow this phenomenon is perceived in the sample imagery.\nIn general, the analysis shows a profound difference in the brand perception between the two different targets (dentists and dental technicians).
