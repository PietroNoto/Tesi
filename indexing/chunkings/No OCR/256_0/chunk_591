This is the case of Amann Girrbach, where the \u201cProduct quality\u201d and the \u201cManagement costs\u201d show a higher than average weights. Zirkonzahn \nand 3M show a very high weight of \u201cProduct quality\u201d, while then overall satisfaction of Sirona, Dentsply and Dental Wings look to be mostly affected by the factor \u201cSupport \nand assistance\u201d.\nMULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS\nThe regression analysis is a multi-variate statistical technique whose main aim is to find out the existing relationship between a target variable (dependent variable, in our case, the overall satisfaction) \nand a group of independent variables (each single factor derived from the factor analysis).\nOne of the main focus of the multiple regression is to assess how much part of the dependent variable (satisfaction) is explained by the independent variables (corner stone factors of the satisfaction \nwhich have been previously indicated", "type": "Document"}}
