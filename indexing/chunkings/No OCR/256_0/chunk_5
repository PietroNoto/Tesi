In order to fully \nrepresent the market, the cases have been properly weighted. The \nweight has been calculated considering the distribution of dental \npractices in the given countries.\nPlease keep in mind that the sample size in each country is limited \n(approximately 200 cases per country), resulting in a statistical error \nranging from 6% to 8%. Therefore, the data pertaining to individual \ncountries should be regarded as indicative.\n4\nAlthough the results of the overall sample are \nobtained by summing weighted cases, it is \nimportant to highlight that at the country \nlevel, the results are obtained using the \nunweighted sample, making them fully \nrepresentative of each individual country. For \nexample, even though the UK contributes 8% \nto the overall result, the results obtained for \nthe UK are based on 200 cases.\nCountry\nReal \ncases\n%\nWeighted \n%\nFrance\n200\n20%\n23%\nGermany\n224\n22%\n29%\nItaly\n200\n20%\n24%\nSpain\n194\n19%\n15%", "type": "Document"}}
