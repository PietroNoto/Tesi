overall 64 the charts show the weight that the items evaluated have on the propensity to recommend a given brand, and on the right, their individual score. high quality, trust and innovation are the items showing the highest correlation with the recommendation. brand image vs recommendation: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? overall 65 (low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) the overall correlation analysis reveals certain prerequisites, such as high reputation, high quality, trust, and innovation. these can be regarded as attributes that users generally expect to find in a brand they use. this map shows the items evaluated in overall and serves as a reference for the comparison with the performance of each brand. prerequisites waste/inefficiency indifference key success factors brand image vs recommendation: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the recommendation?
