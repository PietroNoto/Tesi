(low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) strength points waste/inefficiency indifference critical area for improvement the overall analysis highlights that affordable and makes daily practice easier could be considered as strategic factors in the recommendation, because despite a higher than average weight on it, they resulted to perform lower than average. 52 brand positioning factor analysis brand positioning: factor analysis the factor analysis is a multi-variate statistical analysis used to investigate and give explanation of the correlations among a given number of variables. it relies on the concept that the correlations among the variables are not random, because they are due to some existing common factors. the aim is to identify and quantify the above said common factors. the factor analysis is a psychometric analysis, and it is used in the behavioural sciences, like social sciences, marketing, product management and other environments where a big amount of data is present. in this case, we have used the factor analysis to identify the main recommendation drivers for the main brands stated in the unaided awareness. the best results of the factor analysis have been achieved with 3 main factors: reputation customer orientation expensiveness factor 1 (reputation): this factor includes the items related to the image of the company, its ability to be a leading and highly reputable brand and its attitude towards innovation. factor 2 (customer orientation): this factor is made up of those items referring to a certain ability of the company to be customer oriented, not only in terms of customer service, but also with all those aspects regarding the ability to make the daily practice easier and its value for money. factor 3 (expensiveness): this factor is clearly related to the pricing policy and it shows a positive high correlation with the expensiveness, suggesting that a higher price could be a warranty of quality. 3 factors reputation customer orientation expensiveness leading company 0,893 worldwide reknown 0,853 highly reputable 0,782 innovative and at the forefront 0,688 trustworthy 0,625 good price quality ratio 0,813 makes daily practice easier 0,760 affordable 0,696 reliable 0,596 customer service oriented 0,551 too expensive 0,931 54 the displayed values represent the evaluation score of those factors, with a value ranging from -1 to +1 where 0 represents the overall mean value. for each investigated factor, the horizontal bars represent how much the performance differs from the overall mean (vertical axis). brand positioning: factor analysis - difference from mean + evaluation score dentsply sirona got a higher than average evaluation on reputation and the performance on the expensiveness factor is on par with the overall analysis. the other follower brands got a lower performance in terms of reputation. 55 brand positioning multiple regression analysis brand positioning : multiple regression analysis 39% 12% reputation expensiveness 49% customer orientation in order to complete the factor analysis, it is important to also assess the weight of these factors on the recommendation to understand if an improvement in one of them can also affect the way a particular brand is recommended. therefore, these factors are used as a basis for a further analysis, called multiple regression analysis that aims to understand how they explain the recommendation. the figure \"r2 = 0,645\" means that about 65% of the recommendation is explained and it is based on the given factors. the overall model shows that the weight of the customer orientation factor is about 49%, therefore the importance of this factor is relevant. the second most important factor is the reputation and expensiveness show the lowest weights. recommendation (r2=0,645) 57 brand positioning : multiple regression analysis the chart highlights the weight of the analyzed factors on the recommendation, for dentsply sirona and for the other brands in overall, with the aim to understand if an improvement in one of them can also affect the way a given brand is recommended. in comparison to the overall breakdown, dentsply sirona is characterized by a lower than the average weight of customer orientation and a higher weight of expensiveness. 58 intention to buy technology intention to buy: intraoral scanner are you willing to purchase an intra-oral scanner to take digital impressions within 2 years?
