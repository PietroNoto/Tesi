(multiple answer) 36 base: 1000 cases according to the opinion of the respondents the main consequence brought by 3d printing is related to the wider array of materials available. this is the most quoted one with 76% of yes. the least mentioned possible consequence brought by 3d printing is a reduction in the costs of the restorations, which received only 40% of positive responses. it will be interesting to evaluate in the following slides, option by option, the different behaviour in the evaluated countries. a) the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden (kind of materials will broaden) b) the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase (efficiency/flexibility will increase) c) the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad- cam blocks (costs of restorations will decrease) scenario: main consequences in dentistry brought by 3d printing which of the following statements do you agree on, with regard to the main consequences that 3d printing will bring to the dentistry? (multiple answer - analysis on: the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden) 37 base: 1000 cases its interesting to note the slightly lower positive opinion of the german respondents, about the fact that the 3d printing may bring a wide range of materials available. very high the percentage of yes for france, italy and spain. scenario: main consequences in dentistry brought by 3d printing which of the following statements do you agree on, with regard to the main consequences that 3d printing will bring to the dentistry?

(multiple answer - analysis on: the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks) 39 base: 1000 cases the sample of dental practices shows a rather low percentage of positive responses, as the average is 40% of respondents thinking that 3d printing will bring a reduction in the cost of the restorations. the lowest percentage comes from germany (32%), but france and spain are on the same level. uk and italy are the most positive ones (46% and 54% respectively, of yes answers). scenario: main consequences in dentistry brought by 3d printing which of the following statements do you agree on, with regard to the main consequences that 3d printing will bring to the dentistry? focus on yes answers 40 base: 1000 cases the answers yes belonging to all 3 possible options were summed up. the charts shown in this slide resumes the weight that the yes responses of each option has out of the total yes answers from all three options. the charts highlight that the consequence indicated to be the most probable one is an improvement in the range of materials and procedures available, which will become broader with the development of 3d printing. no relevant differences can be highlighted in the countries evaluated. brand awareness brand awareness: unaided what manufacturers of the new digital technology world (as scanners, cad-cam, 3d printing, etc.) come to your mind? 42 among the listed brands, sirona can be considered the only true digital technology brand, as the awareness of the other ones is rather related to their presence in the market, regardless of the new digital technologies. spontaneous awareness (unaided): it represents the entire group of brands of a certain product family, recalled by the interviewed sample. within the boundaries of spontaneous awareness, the consumer reasonably decides to make a purchase. base: 988 cases processing without don't know brand awareness: unaided what manufacturers of the new digital technology world (as scanners, cad-cam, 3d printing, etc.) come to your mind? 43 uk, where the digital technologies penetration is rather low, is the only country where sirona is not the leader. germany shows a co-leadership of sirona and kavo. awareness and association with the digital technologies of carestream and planmeca are affected by their presence in the x-ray digital market. total de fr it sp uk sirona 34% sirona 51% sirona 28% sirona 34% sirona 11% 3m 33% kavo 13% kavo 30% 3m 12% 3m 19% 3m 10% dentsply 20% 3m 12% 3m 4% planmeca 4% carestream 7% carestream 6% sirona 18% carestream 4% dentsply 3% kavo 2% kavo 6% planmeca 3% kavo 15% planmeca 3% planmeca 1% carestream 2% planmeca 5% kavo 2% carestream 9% dentsply 3% ios technologies 1% nobel biocare 2% nobel biocare 2% nobel biocare 2% dental wings 2% nobel biocare 1% heraeus 1% straumann 1% mht 2% zirkonzahn 2% ios technologies 2% zirkonzahn 1% dental direkt 1% lyra 1% dentsply 1% dentsply 1% biolase 2% straumann 1% henry schein 1% zirkonzahn 1% straumann 1% planmeca 1% other 5% other 0% other 0% other 0% other 0% other 0% total 988 total 324 total 190 total 261 total 134 total 79 processing without don't know brand positioning brand positioning: overall brands in your opinion, how do the brands that i am going to read out to you rate in the following areas?", "type": "Document"}}
