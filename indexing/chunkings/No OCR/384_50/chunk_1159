In order to objectively assess the level of \nconfidence in the future, it may be useful to put in relation the 2 variables. In fact, the answer \u00abIt will remain stable\u00bb does have a negative value if the respondent \nperceived a reduction, while it becomes a positive answer when the respondent experienced a development of the business. In order to obtain an unbiased \nconfidence index, we assume that when the current situation is considered negative, the \u201cconfidence index\u201d will be considered positive only when a consistent \nincrease is the forecast for the future. Vice versa, if there\u2019s a current positive situation, a stable forecast will be considered a positive forecast too.\nThe model highlights a generalized optimism. 66% of the respondents shows a positive confidence index, 22% is neutral and 12% show a negative index.\nThus, the global index is positive (54%).\n15\nIt will \ndecrease a lot\nIt will \ndecrease \nslightly\nIt will remain \nstable\nIt will \nincrease \nslightly\nIt will \nincrease a lot\nIncreased a lot\n0,0%\n0,1%\n1,3%\n2,6%\n0,8%\n33%\n66%\nIncreased slightly\n0,0%\n0,2%\n13,6%\n22,7%\n3,9%\n33%\nStable\n0,0%\n0,7%\n17,6%\n18,6%\n1,6%\n22%\n54%\nDecreased slightly", "type": "Document"}}
