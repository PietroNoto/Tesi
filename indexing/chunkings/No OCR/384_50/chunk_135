As an example, a 95% confidence level means that the data acknowledged by the research is secure in 95% \nof the cases. \nConfidence interval\nIndicates how much the research data deviate from reality. Though the research results are representative, they may not perfectly match those that \nwould be obtained if the entire population was considered, each probing has an approximation degree that makes up the research's maximum \nerror. In this case, the confidence interval of +-4% indicates that if data in the research equals 50%, the actual result may vary in +4% or -4%, i.e, it \nshould be considered between 64%(60%+4%) and 56% (60%-4%).\nCalculation basis for contingency data\nGenerally, the development presented here is calculated based on the responses of interviewees (usually the charts are blue colored) and indicate \nthe percentage of dentists that  achieve a given result. In other cases, certain questions have a quantitative nature (number of fillings, number of \nchairs, number of patients, etc.) and in this case, the reference base is the total amount in respect to the analyzed subject. (% of fillings, % of chairs, \n% of patients, etc.), in this case, the charts are usually green colored.\nOther types of sample are indicated separately (e.g., % or average of fillings with amalgam in the full probing or only related to those that used \namalgam).\nTypes of questions\nThe research was completely developed with close-ended questions, which would result a single answer (therefore, the total of answers with a \n100% result) or multiple answers (in this case, the sum of answers above 100% because the", "type": "Document"}}
