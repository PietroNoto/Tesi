Internet connectivity and digital reliability are minor concerns. Price sensitivity varies by \ncountry: 20% in France view price as a significant barrier, while nearly 50% in Spain see it as such. Full arch scanning is less problematic in France but more relevant in \nSpain. In Spain, team mindset and compatibility with laboratories are also significant concerns, along with some issues related to compatibility with aligner brands.\nUsefulness of IOS\nThe perceived usefulness of the scanner is high in all analyzed situations, with particular emphasis on time optimization, clinical effectiveness, and internal planning. In \nSpain, the scanner is considered less useful for time optimization compared to other countries, while in Italy it is positively evaluated across all areas. In France, the focus is \nprimarily on optimization and clinical effectiveness, with less attention given to communication and marketing. Differences between owners and non-owners are evident, \nespecially regarding the use for communication and marketing.\n", "type": "Document"}}
