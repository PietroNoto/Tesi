(% of fillings, % of chairs, % of patients, etc.), in this case, the charts are usually green colored. other types of sample are indicated separately (e.g., % or average of fillings with amalgam in the full probing or only related to those that used amalgam). types of questions the research was completely developed with close-ended questions, which would", "type": "Document"}}
