This \nkind of analysis, has a relevant advantage: the here defined set of 2 \ndrivers allows to design a positioning map, explained by the following \nslide.\nFactor 1 (Nearness) it is driven by items like Good price quality ratio, \nAffordability, Customer service oriented, clearly related to the nearness, \nwhose concept is reinforced by Trustworthy, Makes daily practice easier \nand Reliable.\nFactor 2 (Reputation) it is driven by items clearly related to the reputation, \nsuch as Worldwide renowned and Highly reputable on top of all. Too \nexpensive may be part of the Reputation as brand with high reputation are \noften seen as more expensive than the average, but, although the item \nbelongs to this area, it\u2019s not as strong as shown in the analysis on dental \npractices.\nFACTOR ANALYSIS\nIts goal is to reduce the information contained in several variables by synthesizing a few \nfactors. It aims to identify a substructure underlying a group of variables, and resume this \nsubstructure with a reduced number of latent variables.\nThanks to the factor analysis, some positioning drivers can be identified, that, as a matter of \nfact, represent the brand image analysed.\nTwo Factors\nNearness\nReputation\nGood price quality ratio\n0,754\nAffordable\n0,738\nCustomer Service oriented\n0,647\nTrustworthy\n0,598\nMakes daily practice easier\n0,595\nReliable\n0,581\nWorldwide", "type": "Document"}}
