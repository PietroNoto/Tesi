( scores from 1 \u201c definitely will not be using \u201d to 10 \u201c definitely will be using \u201d ) the possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores among the brands evaluated. the clustering is the following : \u25aa high risk : the scores grouped in this cluster are from 1 to 3. \u25aa medium risk : the scores grouped in this cluster are from 4 to 6. \u25aa low risk : the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to 10. the defection risk derives from the assumption that a low value of repurchase intention may mean a risk that in the future the product will not be used anymore. lower scores in the repurchase intention bear a higher defection risk, while higher scores mean that a current customer will probably still be using that product also in the future. mean 86 base : 538 quotes base : 50 quotes base : 30 quotes base : 26 quotes still comparing the spanish results to the italian ones, it is worth to note the higher perception of risk in spain, where all investigated brands show a certain percentage of very low scores below 4.", "type": "Document"}}
