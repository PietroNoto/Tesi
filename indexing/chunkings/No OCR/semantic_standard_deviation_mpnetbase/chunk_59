75 18% of those not performing fixed prosthetics using digital technologies plan to start within a year. this percentage increases among laboratories with three or more technicians (31%) and among those declaring a positive perception with respect to the future of their business (27%). if, on one hand, the intention to buy have increased remarkably in recent years - in 2012 only 7% of those not providing digitally produced prosthesis declared they would have done - with the wide spreading of the digital technology, still there seem to be a hard socket of those somehow adverse to it, as the very slight change from 2015 (16%) to 2018 (18%) demonstrates. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. base: 159 cases (not providing digital restorations) 2015: 25 cases intention to buy intention to buy technology intention to buy: why not are you planning to start providing fixed prosthesis elements produced with digital technologies (cad-cam / 3d printing) within the next year? if not, why? 76 base: 131 cases (not willing to provide digital restorations) the most relevant reasons still are related to a low demand for this kind of technology / no need, or because it requires what is considered to be a too high investment. intention to buy 2015 customer experience and loyalty metrics overall satisfaction the overall experience with a company and the extent to which their needs are met. perceived value the utility and benefit of a product relative to the cost paid for that product. advocacy a users willingness to recommend a company to colleagues is a key driver of revenue and profit growth in most industries. repurchase intention the likelihood a user will continue to use a companys products in the near future. net promoter score respondents are categorized as either advocates, neutrals, or detractors of each brand. for each brand overall, the nps subtracts the percent share of detractors from the percent share of advocates, to show net impact on word-of- mouth referrals. loyalty metrics overall satisfaction loyalty metrics perceived value likelihood to recommend repurchase intention detractors neutrals advocates brand advocacy score 78 satisfaction score: overall brands lets consider now each one of the used cad-cam brands, please rate your satisfaction concerning the following factors.

(scores from 1 strongly disagree to 10 strongly agree) the possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores among the brands evaluated. the clustering is the following: low value/price ratio: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 1 to medium value/price ratio: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to high value/price ratio: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 9 to 10. 84 mean base: 538 quotes base: 50 quotes base: 30 quotes base: 26 quotes open technologies shows a relevant performance in perceived value score, while 3shape mean value is below average. mean n.p.s base: 538 quotes base: 50 quotes base: 30 quotes base: 26 quotes net promoter score: main brands how likely are you to recommend the following cad-cam company brands to a colleague? (scores from 0 extremely unlikely to 10 extremely likely) it is interesting to note that, according to the literature, generally speaking, the nps value should be above 20 to be considered satisfactory. certainly this value may differ according to the market segment under analysis, but its just interesting to note that the highest nps score in this case is 13 by amann girrbach. it is also worth to compare the spanish results from italy, where the values of the leading brands were all above the possible answers have been further clustered. the clustering is the following: detractor: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 0 to neutral: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to advocate: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 9 to 10. 85 repurchase intention score: main brands 5 years from now, how likely are you to still be using the cad-cam equipment of the following company brands? (scores from 1 definitely will not be using to 10 definitely will be using) the possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores among the brands evaluated. the clustering is the following: high risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 1 to medium risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 4 to low risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to the defection risk derives from the assumption that a low value of repurchase intention may mean a risk that in the future the product will not be used anymore. lower scores in the repurchase intention bear a higher defection risk, while higher scores mean that a current customer will probably still be using that product also in the future. mean 86 base: 538 quotes base: 50 quotes base: 30 quotes base: 26 quotes still comparing the spanish results to the italian ones, it is worth to note the higher perception of risk in spain, where all investigated brands show a certain percentage of very low scores below overall satisfaction bivariate correlation analysis bivariate correlation analysis the bivariate correlation analysis is a technique that helps to identify and measure the influence of the independent variables (in this case, current and former users) on the dependent one (in this case, the overall satisfaction). the bivariate correlation analysis has been used to quantify the relation between the score on the single satisfaction items and the rating on the overall satisfaction. therefore, it is possible to retrieve a hierarchy of importance from the individual statements and to display them in a chart, and then on a map. the vertical axis always shows the satisfaction ratings that the different factors have received, on average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence on the overall satisfaction. in this way, its obtained an estimated importance of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a bit different from the one explicitly stated. the analysis of the weight of each of the factors, and not only of the declared importance, allows for some interesting considerations. the items have a different meaning according to the point of view with which they are considered: statistical note satisfaction related to the whole market here we can highlight some prerequisites (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors satisfy the market), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, where companies are not always able to satisfy customers with regard to strategic issues), and indifference areas (lower-left side of the map) which become waste/not efficient areas when a company decides to invest in those items belonging to the upper-left side of the map, since they tend to satisfy the market but they actually dont affect the overall satisfaction at all. satisfaction related to a specific company/product here the scheme is the same, but we can highlight the strength points in the upper-right side of the map, which can determine inefficiency or indifference if placed in the left side of the map. in the lower-right we can note an improvement area, where we can find the weak points of a certain company (higher than average weight on the company satisfaction but lower than average satisfaction score). 88 the charts shows the weight that the items evaluated have on the overall satisfaction and on the right, their individual satisfaction score. reliability, handiness and accuracy show the highest correlation scores, while the items related to the software updates, technical support and assistance have less impact on the overall satisfaction. its interesting to note the differences in the importance of the attributes when different topics are considered: in overall, it looks like the recommendation is dependent from confidence in the brand, reliability and the fact that the brand is customer oriented, while when it comes to evaluate the overall satisfaction in the use of this kind of equipment, the most relevant items are referred - more than the simple reliability - to the ease of use, increased productivity and the possibility to make the daily practice easier. also, although the cost of sw updates seems not to be a relevant issue, the overall running costs look to have an impact on the overall satisfaction. overall satisfaction: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the overall satisfaction? overall brands 89 items importance satisfaction score overall satisfaction: correlation analysis map how much are worth the single items on the overall satisfaction? overall brands 90 the map is the visual result of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. the horizontal axis represents the weight of each item on the overall satisfaction, while the vertical axis shows the satisfaction rating of each item. at the top right of the map there are the items that are very correlated to the overall satisfaction and the respondents stated to be more than average satisfied. at the bottom right there are the items that are very correlated to the overall satisfaction, but with lower than average satisfaction scores. it is interesting to see that the company availability and flexibility, the overall running costs and the start-up training are key items in the construction of the overall satisfaction. (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) (low) satisfaction score (high) waste/inefficiency indifference prerequisites key success factors overall satisfaction: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the overall satisfaction? open technologies 91 items importance satisfaction score the charts shows the weight that the items evaluated have on the overall satisfaction and on the right, their individual satisfaction score. the correlation analysis on open technologies highlights that accuracy, reliability the ability to make the daily practice easier are very important items for the construction of the satisfaction. not significant not significant not significant overall satisfaction: correlation analysis map how much are worth the single items on the overall

the visual result of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. the horizontal axis represents the weight of each item on the overall satisfaction, while the vertical axis shows the satisfaction rating of each item. at the top right of the map there are the items that are very correlated to the overall satisfaction and the respondents stated to be more than average satisfied. at the bottom right there are the items that are very correlated to the overall satisfaction, but with lower than average satisfaction scores. the start-up training, as seen in the overall analysis map, seems to be important in the construction of the satisfaction among open technologies users, while its satisfaction score looks to be very low indeed. overall satisfaction: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the overall satisfaction? amann girrbach 93 items importance satisfaction score opposite to the overall results, the most relevant items in the construction of amann girrbach satisfaction seems to be related to the company availability and flexibility and to the technical assistance and support areas, in addition to the overall running costs and the software updates. overall satisfaction: correlation analysis map how much are worth the single items on the overall satisfaction? amann girrbach 94 (low) satisfaction score (high) waste/inefficiency indifference strength points critical area for improvement (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) the map is the visual result of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. the horizontal axis represents the weight of each item on the overall satisfaction, while the vertical axis shows the satisfaction rating of each item. at the top right of the map there are the items that are very correlated to the overall satisfaction and the respondents stated to be more than average satisfied. at the bottom right there are the items that are very correlated to the overall satisfaction, but with lower than average satisfaction scores. there is plenty of items in the critical area for improvement in the amann girrbach map, given that almost all items showing a higher than average weight in the construction of the overall satisfaction do show a lower than average satisfaction score. overall satisfaction: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the overall satisfaction? 3shape 95 items importance satisfaction score 3shape correlation analysis shows a quite different situation in comparison to the overall brands. the most important items for the construction of the satisfaction are company availability and flexibility, frequency of sw updates and start-up training. not significant overall satisfaction: correlation analysis map how much are worth the single items on the overall satisfaction? 3shape 96 (low) satisfaction score (high) waste/inefficiency indifference strength points critical area for improvement (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) the map is the visual result of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. the horizontal axis represents the weight of each item on the overall satisfaction, while the vertical axis shows the satisfaction rating of each item. at the top right of the map there are the items that are very correlated to the overall satisfaction and the respondents stated to be more than average satisfied. at the bottom right there are the items that are very correlated to the overall satisfaction, but with lower than average satisfaction scores. as seen in the map of amann girrbach, a lot of items are placed in the critical area for improvement of 3shape map. among them, start up training, frequency of sw updates and overall running costs are those with the highest weight on the overall satisfaction. overall satisfaction factor analysis customer satisfaction: factor analysis the reduction into factors allowed us to obtain 3 main factors performance support operating costs factor 1 (performance) it is about everything related to the performance of the equipment, not only in terms of accuracy, quality and reliability, but also in terms of letting the laboratory perform at its best, having an easier daily practice and an increased productivity. other relevant items featuring this factor are related to a wide range of procedures and materials available. factor 2 (support) it is interesting to note that among the items included in this factor, there is business development support, which is not very closely related to the technical area, whose items are indeed part of this factor, but is felt to be important in the support provided by the brands, especially regarding this kind of equipment. factor 3 (operating costs) the third factor actually is related to the impact that the operating costs of such kind of equipment may have in the daily practice, especially when, sometimes, the software updates come at a certain price level. 98 3 factors performance support operating costs accuracy and overall quality of the restorations 0,831 makes daily practice easier 0,819 productivity increase 0,814 reliability 0,813 wide range of procedures available 0,798 handiness / ease of use 0,769 wide range of materials available 0,728 compatibility with other brands 0,681 start-up training 0,580 company availability and flexibility 0,560 technical assistance in case of repair 0,834 technical support from the company 0,779 business development support 0,549 cost of sw updates 0,861 overall running costs 0,625 + satisfaction level customer satisfaction: factor analysis - difference from mean level of satisfaction by brand on the factors resulting from the factor analysis. the displayed values represent the satisfaction level of those factors, with a value ranging from -1 to +1 where 0 represents the overall mean value. for each investigated factor, the horizontal bars represent how much the satisfaction performance differs from the overall mean (vertical axis). the significant differences from the mean are marked with a red circle, so that it is possible to focus on the most interesting topics. with this regard, it is worth to note the higher than average performance of amann girrbach and 3shape regarding the factor performance, while it is significant the below average performance of 3shape in the factor operating costs. 99 overall satisfaction multiple regression analysis customer satisfaction: multiple regression analysis 101 in order to complete the factor analysis, it is important to also assess the weight of these factors on the overall satisfaction to understand if an improvement in one of them can also improve the satisfaction of a particular brand. therefore, these factors are used as a basis for a further analysis, called multiple regression analysis that aims to understand how they explain the overall satisfaction. the figure \"r2 = 0,878\" means that more than 80% of the total satisfaction is explained and it is based on the given factors, which is a remarkable result. the overall model shows that the weight of the performance factor is slightly less than 50%, therefore the importance of this factor is relevant. the second factor is the support, then operating costs shows the lowest weight. it is interesting to look at the following slides, when the same analysis is carried out on the single brands. overall satisfaction (r2=0,878) 46% 25% performance operating costs 29% support customer satisfaction: multiple regression analysis 102 apart from open technologies, showing a relevant weight for the factor performance, it looks like the regression models of the other investigated brands is predominantly driven by the operating costs, meaning that this factor highly affects the overall satisfaction of amann girrbach and 3shape, while for open technologies it has a marginal weight. as a matter of fact, for amman girrbach and 3shape, the items included in this factor emerged as key items to improve the overall satisfaction in the correlation analysis and the factor analysis highlighted the need to improve this topic. especially in the case of 3shape, looking back at its satisfaction scores in the factor analysis, it now looks more important strategically the weaker performance on the operating costs factor, more than the strong results on the performance factor.
