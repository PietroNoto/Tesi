how many partner laboratories does your practice have in total? mean: 2,6 labs the presence of the laboratory in the dental practice is a specific feature of the german market, less frequent in other countries (less than 10%). the peculiarities of spain is due to legislative issues: the laboratory must be separated from the practice by law (even when the activities are in the same location, they must have separate entrance). only 20% of dental practices collaborate with a single laboratory (31% in uk), about one in two clinics has at least 3 laboratory partners. clinic base: 1.061 cases base: 1.061 cases specialization of the clinic does your clinic specialize in only a few disciplines, or does it develop almost all treatments? 7 if it is specialized: in which disciplines? in general, although 13% of dental practices can be considered multi-disciplinary, the dental sector - in the analyzed countries - is almost entirely made up of general practices. 54% of those reporting specializations perform orthodontics (this accounts for 7% of the total number of clinics surveyed, from which those performing exclusively orthodontics have been excluded). the sample do not include practices exclusively specialized in orthodontics clinic cases 256 224 200 201 180 germany france italy spain uk implantology 75% 68% 66% 82% 48% surgery 71% 53% 79% 76% 36% orthodontics 53% 35% 50% 64% 82% periodontology 56% 46% 50% 51% 36% prosthetics (fixed / mobile) 51% 19% 67% 49% 54% aesthetics 53% 28% 34% 56% 50% restorative 53% 28% 25% 48% 60% endodontics 35% 25% 59% 49% 54% pediatric dentistry 49% 14% 34% 36% 42% cases 256 224 200 201 180 number of treatments per month considering a standard working month in 2021, how many of the following treatments are performed in your clinic overall? 8 the here shown overall mean values of the monthly production (among the surveyed sample), although they should be used as an indication only, allow to retrieve very useful data on the weight for some of the key treatments in the dental practices. by considering the performance heterogeneity in the surveyed countries (due to the average size of the centers and the characteristics of the demand for dental treatments), the following slide shows the breakdown by geographical area. please note, the indirect restorations (veneers, inlays and onlays), are not included in the new cases of fixed prosthetics. it should be noted that the used opinion poll approach, which does not include the responses of \"non clinic owners, is not totally representative of the actual stratification of the reference universe with regard to the type and size of the dental practices. therefore, this methodology does not allow for the projection of the mean values of the sample on the reference universe in order to assess the total market. 4,3 18,6 84,7 average 73,2 9,6 9,0 6,8 clinic although the focus of the research is the digital flow, in light of a possible integration of the use of technologies and the different restorative, prosthetic and orthodontic therapies, it has been decided to investigate the number of treatments carried out in the clinic regarding fillings/restoration, oral hygiene/scaling, fixed protheses, implants, veneers, inlays/onlays and professional whitening. base: 1.061 cases treatments summary 9 in addition to the analysis of the production mean values by geographic area, it is very important to consider the penetration of the different therapies (kind of therapy performed: yes / no). nevertheless, the averages are calculated on the total sample: the practices not performing a given treatment have been considered with value = it should be noted that the used opinion poll approach, which does not include the responses of \"non clinic owners, is not totally representative of the actual stratification of the reference universe with regard to the type and size of the dental practices. therefore, this methodology does not allow for the projection of the mean values of the sample on the reference universe in order to assess the total market. clinic mean 5,4 dental technicians 12,7 served practices 1999 10 sample segmentation demographic and structural clusters - all labo base: 594 cases 11 sample segmentation demographic and structural clusters labo germany france italy spain uk employee 13% 7% 2% 4% 13% manager or director 30% 34% 6% 15% 45% owner 57% 60% 93% 82% 42% i influence the decision 44% 33% 30% 14% 49% i decide by myself 56% 67% 70% 86% 51% 1 or 2 12% 26% 54% 46% 18% 3 or 4 26% 32% 29% 20% 34% 5 or 6 23% 17% 8% 20% 18% more than 6 37% 25% 9% 14% 30% 5,4 7,5 5,3 3,3 4,4 6,1 up to 5 18% 18% 40% 20% 18% from 6 to 9 30% 28% 25% 22% 27% from 10 to 15 31% 23% 15% 28% 28% more than 15 14% 25% 18% 24% 17% 12,7 11,5 15,8 10,8 13,7 12,0 before 2000 41% 37% 75% 58% 31% from 2000 to 2010 39% 40% 18% 21% 37% from 2011 to 2021 21% 22% 7% 21% 32% 1999 1999 2002 1992 1998 2003 no 84% 90% 67% 55% 58% yes 16% 10% 33% 45% 42% cases 137 114 125 113 105 dental lab association profession role number of dental technicians number of served dental practices laboratory opening year overall production of treatments - breakdown considering a standard working month, how many of the following cases are performed in your lab overall? 12 laboratories are starting to work significantly on the invisible aligners production (48% of laboratories state to produce aligners). as regards spain, it should be considered that it is the country with highest number of produced cases and where align has a very significant share (it has been estimated that around 150.000 cases have been made during 2021). practicing laboratories (treatments penetration) % of cases (base: total treatments, whole sample) simple fixed prostheses cases 96% complex fixed prostheses cases 93% removable prostheses 87% orthodontics (invisible aligners) 48% 100% 91% 97% 96% 98% 95% 89% 91% 90% 97% 96% 84% 93% 75% 87% 53% 63% 29% 26% 69% labo base: 594 cases cases 137 114 125 113 105 intraoral scanners technology and brands penetration in the practice intraoral scanner penetration do you have an intraoral scanner for taking optical impressions? 14 slightly less than 25% of practices do own an ios, with high intention to buy in spain, italy and france. also, it is worth to note the difference in the frequent use of the ios between aligners providers (25%) vs non providers (10%). in the countries where key-stone manages panels from the industry and distribution, there is a consistent growth in ios sales. we are now in the phase where both the number of users is steadily increasing and sales of additional machines in already digitalised practices are being recorded. the market is in a full development phase, with more than 20% of clinics already using ios, and penetration growing rapidly over time. when about half of the potential market (about 80% of clinics) is covered (i.e., about 40% of clinics is digitalised), the weight of sales of replacement units will start to increase (also taking into account that the average obsolescence of models is about 7 years). this moment will represent the trade-off of the market, which will develop at a slower pace with an increase in the weight of the software component on the total business. clinic base: 1.061 cases germany france italy spain uk yes, and we use it often 22% 17% 24% 20% 20% yes, but we rarely use it 7% 2% 3% 3% 7% no, but we plan to buy it 34% 44% 41% 53% 29% no, and we don't plan to buy it 36% 35% 32% 24% 44% no, and we don't know if we will buy it 1% 2% 1% cases 256 224 200 201 180 intraoral scanners age what are the brand and the year of purchase of your intraoral scanner?

labs receiving intra-oral scan files if never, why? smaller labs bigger labs when the impact of ios scans on the lab business is positive, labs approach doctors more frequently. labs approaching dentists for the practice digitization is quite high, lower than average in the mediterranean countries. in spain, the development of digital technologies in the dental sector has accelerated significantly in the last two years, which is the reason why the percentage of laboratories approaching studies on this subject is high. the reason for not recommending varies with the size of the laboratories: small laboratories do not recommend because they do not feel adequate, while large laboratories, which are the most digitalised ones, are also the ones that can spend less time on this activity. bigger labs higher than average for a frequent approach (46% often). the frequency of the approaches to dentists is higher as the lab overall business trend is positive (43% often). labo base: 524 cases cases 123 108 101 91 101 full digital workflow 21 main arguments to convince doctors about digitization when discussing with your doctors about starting/furthering the digitization process of their practice with an intra-oral scanner, what argumentation do you use to convince them? - top 3 ranking the owner of the lab pays more attention to the workflow simplification (54%) and the improved perception of the practice (42%). lab managers talk more about the reduced number of remakes (41%). accuracy of the scan files is more often used by big sized labs (59%). improvement of the workflow is also more often quoted by respondents whose lab experienced an overall increase of their business (51%). technical, procedural and patients experience arguments are used the most. labo in italy, the proposed topics are significantly different from those of the rest of the countries. simplification of the workflow, improvement of the patient experience and of the perception of the practice among patients emerge as relevant, while the impact of the accuracy of the scans is low. some topics are very often listed in the top three as most relevant, resulting in better ranking averages. the items at the top right of the map, together with the item simplification of workflow suggest that there is a desire to improve the synergy between the practice and the laboratory and the management of the communication flow between them. base: 409 cases seldom and often quotes 22 frequency of doctors approaching labs about ios recommendation how often do you get approached by doctors about your recommendation on intra-oral scanner? 30% of dental labs are approached at least monthly. frequency of recommendation increases as the labs size and their digitization level increase. this is also true for labs performing a higher-than-average number of ortho cases with aligners. currently, spain is the country with the lowest penetration of ios but with higher growth rates and in full digitalization process. labo the laboratories state that they are approached by dentists with a certain frequency. a frequent approach is considered to be 'monthly' to 'daily'. although the frequency of approach is fairly homogeneous between countries, spain and france show a higher-than- average overall frequency of 'monthly/weekly/daily'. base: 594 cases cases 137 114 125 113 105 23 recommended intraoral scanner brands when asked by the clinician, do you recommend a specific intra-oral scanner brand? which intra-oral scanner brand do you recommend most often? 3shape is quoted more than average among big sized labs (49%), by the lab owners (39%), less recently open structures and those stating the business has decreased (40% and 46% respectively). itero is quoted more than average among more recently open labs (25%) and among labs receiving a high share of scan files (22%). less than average among labs performing a high share of prosthetic complex cases (12%). medit is quoted more than average among labs receiving a lower share of scan files (23%). dentsply sirona is quoted more than average among labs receiving scan files from more than half of clients (20%). labo recommendation is very high: on an overall basis, at least 90% of the laboratories approached by dentists recommend a brand. 3shape is the most recommended brand in spain and italy, while itero is most recommended in the uk. carestream has adopted a very widespread distribution and commercial strategy, which explains the high number of recommendations in italy (achieving a significantly higher penetration than in the other analysed countries). diverse recommended brands across the surveyed countries: 3shape is most quoted, itero is main follower. why do you recommend the mentioned ios brand? (multiple choice) scanner performance and clinic / lab integration are the most quoted reasons. brand reputation is quoted more often among bigger sized labs (62%) and those performing ortho cases with invisible aligners (58%). the latter also quote community more often than average (20%). integration is quoted more often by labs serving a higher number of practices (60%). service / post sales support is more often quoted by labs receiving a higher share of scan files (46%). base: 440 cases intraoral scanners brands when receiving scan files what are the top 3 brands of the intra-oral scanners that you receive files from? 24 3shape is top quoted brand for ios scan files received. carestream is very widespread in italy compared to the average in the other countries. 3shape is quoted more than average by bigger sized labs (73%) and so is for dentsply sirona (52%). again, 3shape is quoted more than average by labs equipped with a milling unit (62%) and 3d printer (60%). itero (52%) and medit (35%) are more often quoted among recently open labs. exocad users do show higher than average quotes for itero (46%). dentsply sirona is more than average quoted by labs receiving scan files from more than 50% of their clients (62%). full digital workflow labo base: 524 cases intraoral scanners brands: recommendation vs scan files reception when asked by the clinician, which intra-oral scanner brand do you recommend most often? what are the top 3 brands of the intra-oral scanners that you receive files from? 25 full digital workflow labo at overall level, a possible relationship between the brand of the ios from which the scan is received and the recommendation of the ios brand has been investigated. the results show that 3shape has the highest relationship between the brand from which the labs receive the scanner and the recommendation. it is also true that 3shape, due to its popularity and seniority in the ios market, has a high frequency of recommendation even in labs receiving scans from other brands. in fact, it is always cited as the second brand regardless of the brand of ios from which the labs receive scans (for carestream it is the first). this also shows that 3shape's reputation is very high. base: 524 cases 3shape dentsply sirona itero medit carestream planmeca 3shape 55% 26% 29% 24% 33% 17% dentsply sirona 12% 30% 9% 5% 7% 13% itero 13% 12% 37% 20% 16% 21% medit 8% 12% 8% 38% 8% 2% carestream 7% 9% 5% 8% 32% 8% planmeca 2% 7% 7% 2% 1% 35% ios brand: received files ios brand: recommendation other digital workflow components penetration chairside milling system penetration do you have a chairside milling system in your dental practice? 27 the penetration of the milling center in dental practices is rather low, but it is worth to underline that in germany this penetration of milling units is historically higher due to the presence of the so called practice lab. for both uk and germany, the higher presence of dentsply sirona make the penetration of this equipment higher than average. most of the installed equipment is rather old, with a slowdown in purchases in 2018 and 2019 and a subsequent growth in recent years (2020-2021). given the low sample base, the information is featured by a high statistical error, so it is recommended to use the information as a qualitative indication only. year of purchase average: 2016 clinic base: 1.061 cases germany france italy spain uk yes, and we use it often 12% 6% 6% 2% 8% yes, but we rarely use it 4% 1% 1% 3% no, but we plan to buy it 15% 9% 19% 22% no, and we don't plan to buy it 66% 83% 91% 75% 66% no, and we don't know if we will buy it 2% 2% 3% 3% 0% cases 256 224 200 201 180 chairside milling system brands what are the brands of your chairside milling system?", "type": "Document"}}
