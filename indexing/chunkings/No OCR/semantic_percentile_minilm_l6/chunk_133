labo percentage of elements 92% of the interviewed laboratories (which produce prostheses with digital workflow) perform prosthesis on implants. 83% of cad-cam elements are produced for prosthesis on implants, the remaining 17% for traditional prosthesis. percentage of laboratories prosthesis on implants cad-cam production share 2018 % elements produced with cad-cam 10,3 100,0% elements for prosthesis on implants 8,5 82,6% elements for traditional prosthesis 1,8 17,4% total (providers of cad-cam elements) 417 19 scenario stance and opinions about digital technologies in dentistry change in the way restorations are performed in your opinion, does the use of the digital technology change the type of restorations? if yes, which way? 21 clinic change in the way restorations are performed two predicted changes are more correlated with the arrival of the digital prosthesis: evolution of the materials or differentiation increase in the weight of the fixed prosthesis vs the removable one role of digital technologies on prosthetics in the future how do you feel the new digital technologies will affect the way the prosthetics is carried out in your country? dental practices laboratories clinic + labo the belief that digital technologies can totally replace analog ones is 73% for those who already supply digital prosthesis, compared to 44% of those who are still reluctant. for laboratories, the awareness of the total replacement of the traditional prosthesis with the digital one is much more widespread: 68% of those who already provide it and 56% of those who dont. 22 role of dentists and technicians in the future how do you think dentists and technicians role will change with the new digital technologies? 23 dental practices laboratories the feeling that dentists could over time acquire technician skills is widespread and transversal for 40% of the sample, however, it reduces to 25% for technicians who have a high level of technological equipment. clinic + labo more than a half of dentists are optimistic about improving the relationship with technicians, although around 30% believe that some processes (or phases) may overlap. this is especially true for chairside owners (46%), however, it drastically reduces among those who already send scans to the laboratory (8%). stance versus digital technologies what is your stance versus the digital technologies? 24 dental practices laboratories clinic + labo in the dental pratices that still dont provide digital prosthesis, the feeling of discomfort and attitudinal distance rises to 52%. the problem is even more noticeable in the laboratories that still dont provide digital works, even in outsourcing, with a feeling of unease that rises to 65%. the situation is completely different for those who already use the technologies which, unlike dentists, seem to be more at ease. required features from digital technology providers what should your digital technology provider offer you, to improve and enhance the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your laboratory?
