(low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) the items on the upper right side of the map, very close one to each other, will be further investigated on the regression analysis, in order to evaluate their importance on the recommendation. brand image vs recommendation - correlation analysis ranking 54 focus on weight on recommendation when the analysis is performed on the ranking based on the weight that the different items have on the recommendation of the main brands, its interesting to note how not all items are relevant to all brands. this is the case of 3m, where several items are not relevant, while its recommendation looks to be more affected by the fact that it makes the daily practice easier, reliability, innovation and reputation. overall ranking sirona kavo 3m others trustworthy 1 3 1 n.a 1 reliable 2 2 2 2 3 highly reputable 3 1 5 n.a 7 makes daily practice easier 4 4 9 1 5 worldwide renowned 5 5 3 3 8 innovative and at the forefront 6 8 4 4 2 leading company 7 7 6 n.a 4 customer service oriented 8 6 7 n.a 6 good price quality ratio 9 9 8 n.a 9 affordable 10 10 10 n.a 10 too expensive 11 11 n.a. n.a n.a brand image - multiple regression analysis 55 its interesting to note how it looks like in the process of the recommendation both factors are almost equally involved and important.", "type": "Document"}}
