30 base: 1.061 cases as regards the indications for use of the 3d printers, past surveys also indicate a slight shift in the procedures: while a few years ago the most suitable indication was related to temporary c&b, today the most quoted production procedure is surgical guides, followed by aligners. among practices equipped with a 3d printer, formlabs is the leading brand in penetration, followed by anycubic. as regards the use of the machines, it seems that in germany, and partially in the uk, there is a more transversal use across all applications. in italy and spain, the technology is mainly used for the fabrication of surgical guides and temporary elements. it is worth mentioning that in these two countries in 2018, the 3d printer penetration in dental practices was around 1%. what are the main processes you carry out with the 3d printer you have in your clinic?

cad-cam milling unit penetration: 53% intention to buy: 13% desktop scanner penetration: 81% intention to buy: 6% 3d printer penetration: 66% intention to buy: 15% labo desktop scanners are the cad-cam technology that first entered the laboratory and therefore they have the highest penetration rate. 3d printers have been in use in laboratories in more recent years but show a faster growth rate as they require a significantly lower financial investment. when analyzing the results, it should be considered that the analysis has been carried out in laboratories that produce fixed prostheses, thus the penetration shown in the charts might be slightly higher. base: 594 cases 137 114 125 113 105 137 114 125 113 105 137 114 125 113 105 desktop scanner brands is your lab equipped with a desktop scanner?

34 labo what is the brand of your 3d printer? formlabs is the most quoted brand overall, leading the penetration ranking in every country except italy. anycubic is the main follower overall, thanks to an affordable price and an intensive distribution. apart from a concentration for the top position, the rest of the penetration seems to be very fragmented. the market is made up mainly of players coming from outside the traditional dental market, or present in the dental market only for 3d printing systems. anycubic received a higher than average number of quotes among smaller sized labs (1-2 technicians: 33% vs 15% overall; less than 10 served practices: 22%). formlabs penetration is higher than average among labs receiving a higher share of scan files from dentists (more than 50% of practices sending scan files: 41% vs 29% overall). asiga is more quoted among bigger sized labs. germany france italy spain uk penetration 61% 78% 61% 58% 70% formlabs formlabs anycubic formlabs formlabs anycubic stratasys formlabs anycubic asiga asiga anycubic phrozen phrozen stratasys cases 137 114 125 113 105 installed base top 3 ranking cad systems brands 35 please, list the digital design (cad) systems that you use in your laboratory in order of preference. exocad is the undisputed leader in cad design brand penetration. exocad is more quoted among respondents stating training and education is very important (59%) and those stating the lab business has increased (57%). also, it is more quoted when the reception of physical models to digitize is high (59%). 3shape is more quoted among bigger sized labs (34%) and when the number of simple fixed prosthesis cases is high (25%). also, it is more often quoted among labs serving a high number of practices (26%). exocad users do more simple fixed prosthetic cases than average. those not equipped with a desktop scanner or a milling unit do more removable prosthetics. exocad appears to be the most widely used system overall. however, it should be noted that the brands reported are those declared by the respondents, and as exocad is a brand also used by other equipment manufacturers, it is not possible to assess how many of the other quoted brands refer to exocad itself. labo do you use a digital design (cad) system in your laboratory?", "type": "Document"}}
