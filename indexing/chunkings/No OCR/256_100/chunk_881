This is \ntrue for those brand traditionally related to the \ndigital world. \nIt is interesting to note how some brands, \nclearly identified as to belong to the digital \nworld, in order to increase their \nperformance, should work on the level of \ntheir total awareness broadly speaking (thus \nmoving from the lower to the upper side of \nthe map), and some others, already having a \nhigh total awareness, should increase their \nawareness in the digital world, thus moving \ntowards right in the here shown map.\n-                  ", "type": "Document"}}
