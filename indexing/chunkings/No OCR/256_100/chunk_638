For example, a confidence level equal to 95% means that the phenomenon pointed out by the research is correct for the 95% of \nthe cases. \nThe confidence interval indicates how much the research data diverge from reality. As the sample results, even if representative, cannot be perfectly correspondent to those obtainable \ninterviewing the entire population, each research has an approximation degree which represents the maximum error of the research. For example, a confidence interval of \u00b1 3% indicates that if \nthe research phenomenon is equal to 60%, the result can change, in comparison with reality, of an extra 3% or a minus 3% and in this way it is included between 63% (60%+3%) and 57% (60%-\n3%).\n", "type": "Document"}}
