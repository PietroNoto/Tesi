The clustering is the \nfollowing:\nHigh Risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 1 to \n3.\nMedium Risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from \n4 to 6.\nLow Risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to \n10.\nThe defection risk derives from the assumption that a low \nvalue of repurchase intention may mean a risk that in the \nfuture the product will not be used anymore. Lower \nscores in the repurchase intention bear a higher defection \nrisk, while higher scores mean that a current customer \nwill probably still be using that product also in the future.\n", "type": "Document"}}
