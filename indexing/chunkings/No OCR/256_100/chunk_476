Brand positioning, Bivariate correlation analysis: weight of items on the recommendation - \nEurope \nThe bivariate correlation analysis takes into account the relative weight of the single items on a pre-\ndetermined dependent variable, which is the recommendation. It\u2019s a useful analysis which goes beyond \nthe plain and rational score given by the respondents, and tries to assess the actual importance of the \ndifferent items on the recommendation. \nThe charts show that, apart from the item \u201cTrustworthy\u201d, whose importance is unquestionable, the \nmain ones are rather different, according to the sample considered. Among laboratories, given the \nrelative longtime presence of this kind of technologies, the recommendation seems to be mostly \naffected by items related to the daily practice and innovation. On the clinical side, perhaps due to the \nfact that the market is less mature, some items strictly linked to the reputation prevail, as if the users, \nor the potential users, should be mostly concerned by the confidence in the brand first. Affordability, \nfor both samples, doesn\u2019t affect the recommendation at", "type": "Document"}}
