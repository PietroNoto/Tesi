According to the statements of the interviewed laboratories, the following data processing allows to split the productions as \nindicated.\nBase: 405 cases (providers of CAD-CAM elements)\nThe trend analysis highlights an increasing share for \nthe in-house production, mostly at the expense of \nthe production made by the manufacturers / milling \ncenters.\nInterestingly, when considering the production from \nthe point of view of the technology, it is clear how \nthe trend is positive for the scans sent outside at \nthe expense of the full outsourcing mode. \n", "type": "Document"}}
