TECHNOLOGIES\nBase: 405 cases (digital restorations providers) \n66\nPercentage of laboratories\nAmong digital technology users, the most used technology is scanner and the \nmost used way to provide digital restorations is to send scans to a \nmanufacturer or milling center.\n63% is the percent of scanner owners, out of the total digital restorations \nproviders, who use the scanner to send the files outside for milling.\nIn comparison to year 2015, scanner owners increased remarkably, along with \nmilling center owners. On the other hand, the percentage of full outsourcing \nproviders showed a relevant decrease.\nSince laboratories may use different technologies and channels, the sum of \npercentages is higher than 100%.\n", "type": "Document"}}
