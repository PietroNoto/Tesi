(15% vs 7% overall). the image shows a comparative bar and pie chart illustrating the perceived influence of digital technologies on the prosthetics industry across five countries: germany (de), france (fr), uk, italy, and spain (sp). the data indicates various respondents' beliefs regarding the future of prosthetics technology and its potential overlap with traditional prosthetics. the pie and bar charts display the following insights: 1. **germany (de)** - a large blue pie slice indicates 70% believe that digital technologies will have a limited effect on traditional prosthetics. - a blue bar shows 91% indicate that traditional prosthetics will remain relevant in the future. - a blue section within a pie slice states 23% feel that digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics. - a small portion is", "type": "Document"}}
