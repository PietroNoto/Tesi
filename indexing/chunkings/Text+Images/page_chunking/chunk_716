(scores from 0 extremely unlikely to 10 extremely likely) compared to 2015, the net promoter score improves considerably, going from 0% to 38%, thanks to the increase in the percentage of advocates and the decrease in the percentage of detractors. mean: 8,0 n.p.s.: +38% clinic base: 36 cases - 45 quotes (owners) 2015 mean: 7,5 n.p.s.: 0% 99 the possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores. the clustering is the following: detractor: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 0 to neutral: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to advocate: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 9 to the image contains a 3d pie chart with different colored segments representing percentages. it appears to be a data visualization from the first image, showing the distribution of responses related to the net promoter score (nps) within various segments. here's a detailed breakdown: 1. **color classification**: - the largest segment is colored yellow, accounting for 53% of the pie chart. - the orange segment makes up 31% of the chart. - the smallest segment is blue, with 16%. 2. **labels and percentages**: - each colored segment has a percentage label next to it. the blue segment is clearly marked with 16%. - the orange segment is noted as 31%. - the largest segment is noted as 53%, corresponding to the yellow portion of the chart. 3. **overall impression**: - this pie chart is visualizing a distribution similar to that described in the context of net promoter scores. each color corresponds to the grouping of responses (neutral, detractor, advocate) as listed in the first image's cluster descriptions. 4. **comparative analysis (with first image)**: - given that the context provided by the first image discusses the net promoter score and highlights categories such as detractors (0-6), neutral (7-8), and advocates (9-10), it is likely that the pie chart is providing a specific distribution within one of these segments. - the percentages suggest the proportions of responses within one of the categories. in this case, the yellow (53%) segment could represent a significant portion of the neutral category in 2015 (the chart from 2015), highlighting a notable increase or concentration in this segment (neutral) compared to the detractors (0% in 2015). this pie chart, combined with the context from the first image, provides a visual and quantitative depiction of the distribution of responses, emphasizing a shift in sentiment or behavior over time. the image contains a pie chart that visually represents the distribution of a metric based on three differing subcategories. these subcategories are: the largest segment, colored yellow, accounts for 39% of the total. this makes it the most prevalent segment of the chart. the middle segment, colored blue, occupies 30% of the entire pie. it is notably smaller than the yellow segment, indicating a less frequent occurrence of its category. the smallest segment is colored orange and represents 30% of the chart. this segment is equidistant in frequency with the blue segment but stands out due to slight visual differences in color and position. in the context of the surrounding content of the first image, additional insights are provided. the larger pie chart in the first image suggests a comparative analysis spanning two years: the chart indicates that in 2015, the distribution was as follows: 30% detractor, 30% neutral, and 40% advocate, with a mean of 7,5 and a non-response rate (n.r.s.) of 0%. the chart for the current year (likely from 2018) shows increased positivity in the response, revealing an adjusted trend: 35% advocates now, whereas detractors are reduced to 25%, and neutral responses rose to 32%, with a significant increase in the mean score, now at 9. this comparative change indicates an improvement in the perceived quality or performance represented by the metric illustrated by both charts, reflecting a heightened preference or satisfaction among the respondents surveyed.", "type": "Document"}}
