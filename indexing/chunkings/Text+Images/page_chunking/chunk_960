illustrated with a pink bar. - represents 38% of the surveyed laboratories. 2. **scans sent to partner labs:** - indicated with a light pink bar. - accounts for 27% of digital restorations. 3. **scans sent to manufacturers/milling centers:** - shown with a medium pink bar. - represents the majority usage at 57%. 4. **plaster models sent to partner labs:** - displayed with a light pink bar. - accounts for 25% of applications. 5. **plaster models sent to manufacturers/milling centers:** - illustrated with a medium pink bar. - accounts for 27% of digital restorations. ### observations: the most dominant use of digital technology is in the scans sent to manufacturers/milling centers, comprising 57%. the next highest usage category is \"scans sent to partner labs\" at 27%, followed by \"plaster models sent to partner labs\" at 25%. milled in-house processes also significantly contribute, with 38% of digital restorations. plaster models send to either partner labs or manufacturers/milling centers each contribute 25% and 27%, respectively. ### additional information from image-1: the chart on the right side of image-1 provides additional insights on channel usage by year, showing a significant increase for the manufacturer channel from 2015 (19%) to 2018 (70%). below the stacked bar chart is legend for the years represented, showing 2015 with green and 2018 with pink to differentiate the data for both years. the base for the chart involves 405 digital restoration providers, as indicated at the bottom. ### detailed breakdown: **milled in-house**: the use of mills inside the laboratories for digital restoration stands at 38%, indicating that some restoration services either prefer on-site milling or lack access to external facilities for milling. **scans sent to partner labs:** represents 27%, suggesting collaboration with other laboratories for milling processes. **scans sent to manufacturers/milling centers:** this is the highest category, with 57%, showing a strong reliance on external milling facilities. **plaster models sent to partner labs:** indicating 25% of the plaster models sent to external partners, likely for detailed sculpting or creating templates before casting. **plaster models sent to manufacturers/milling centers:** shows 27%, indicating that a significant portion also collaborates directly with manufacturers or external milling centers for production of plaster models. the chart highlights the interconnectedness of the restoration process, showing varying levels of in-house capabilities versus outsourcing to partners or specialists. it also illustrates a shift towards enhanced collaboration and reliance on specialized external service providers.", "type": "Document"}}
