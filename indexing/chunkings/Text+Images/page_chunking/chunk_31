32 flexibility. also, the responses from the laboratories make understand that the increase in the productivity is felt to be an important feature that the digital technologies have to bring. chart reasons to use: milling units - europe efficiency, simplification of the procedures and overall increased quality over the traditional prosthetics procedures are among the most relevant reasons mentioned for use of a chairside milling, or a milling unit at the lab. in this case, the results of the dentists sample are not very different from those of laboratories. chart intention to buy: scanners/milling units - europe its interesting to note that the more mature technical market also shows a lower percentage of intention to by a scanner/milling unit than the dental practices. and again, when it comes to the evaluation of this indicator by country, germany shows the lowest percentages of intention to buy. the image contains bar charts titled \"reasons to use: milling units - europe.\" it provides a comparative analysis of the factors driving the adoption of dental milling units between dental practices and laboratories. below is a detailed breakdown: the main chart comprises two sets of bar charts placed side-by-side. the left side represents responses from \"dental practices,\" while the right side represents responses from \"laboratories.\" each set consists of bars that correspond to various reasons. the bar lengths indicate the percentage of respondents who cited each reason. ### dental practices: **innovation**: 23% **precision of system**: 21% **simplifies the procedures**: 19% **high quality**: 13% **reduces time of procedures**: 7% **comfortable for patients**: 4% **other**: 5% **don't know / no answer**: 12% **makes the daily practice easier**: 39% **quality of the restorations**: 25% **broad range of procedures**: 19% **convenience**: 9% **innovation**: 4% **reputation of the brand**: 4% **flexibility**: 4% **productivity increase**: 3% **other**: 3% **don't know / no answer**: 12% ### observations: the primary driver for both dental practices and laboratories is the enhancement in **daily practice ease**, with **39%** of practices and **25%** of laboratories citing this as the main reason. **dental practices** rank **precision of system** and **innovation** at the second and third places, respectively, with 21% and 23%, showing perhaps a strong need for reliable and cutting-edge technology. conversely, laboratories prioritized **quality of the restorations** at 25%, suggesting the importance of producing high-quality restorations is significantly higher for them. the need for convenience is notable in both settings, at 9% for dental practices and 12% for laboratories. **simplifying procedures** is an important reason in both sectors but a bit more so in **labs (19%)** potentially due to the need for multitasking and efficiency. the first image above the bar charts highlights key digital technology advantages including innovation, system precision, procedure simplification, quality enhancement, convenience, and broad application. it also mentions that laboratories' responses are highly positive towards productivity increases, potentially reflecting the critical nature of efficient operations in their field. the overall message under these charts is that dental professionals across different settings seek technological advancements to enhance performance and patient satisfaction. the image contains two pie charts, side by side, illustrating the intention to buy scanners/milling units among dental practices and laboratories, respectively. *left chart: dental practices** the pie chart is divided into three segments: - a large blue segment labeled \"yes,\" indicating that 21% of dental practices intend to buy scanners/milling units. - a smaller blue segment labeled \"no,\" indicating that 79% of dental practices do not intend to buy scanners/milling units. - a small grey segment labeled \"dont know/no answer,\" indicating that 0% of dental practices were uncertain or did not provide an answer. *right chart: laboratories** this pie chart is also divided into three segments: - the largest segment is in dark blue, marked \"no,\" indicating that 82% of laboratories do not intend to buy scanners/milling units. - a small slice in light blue with the label \"yes,\" showing 12% of laboratories intend to buy these units. - the minimal segment in grey labeled \"dont know/no answer,\" indicates that 6% were uncertain or did not provide an answer. both charts are set against a light background and have a central gap resembling a doughnut, emphasizing the proportions visually. the text beneath each chart labels them appropriately, \"dental practices\" and \"laboratories,\" respectively, providing clarity on the intended audience for the data presented.", "type": "Document"}}
