12 its interesting to note how the majority of respondents declared the new digital technologies will play an important role, in overall this feeling is true for 54% of respondents, but they will not replace the way the traditional restorations are performed. the highest percentage of respondents stating that digital technologies will replace most of the traditional restorations is in spain and italy, followed by france. the statement of those countries may have a correlation with use. this may mean that those countries using more digital technologies are more convinced than others that this technology will replace the traditional prosthesis. the feeling that the digital technologies will not replace completely the traditional prosthetics is almost the same among respondents not providing digital restorations, but is lower than average the percentage of responses related to the fact that the digital technologies will completely replace the traditional prosthetics (27% vs 31% overall). digital technology acceptance in dental offices stance versus digital technologies at this stage, the level of acceptance of the digital technologies was evaluated, with specific regard to how much the dentists feel comfortable with the new technologies. chart dental practices stance to digital technologies europe vs. breakdown per country the sample is rather split between those trying to get closer to digital technologies and those feeling uncomfortable with them. the percentage of respondents using it and feeling comfortable with it, still are the minority at 13%. the highest percentages are in italy, spain and uk. its interesting to correlate the digital technology penetration (chart digital technologies offer) with the stance. for example, germany has the second highest level of penetration (35% of the practices offer restorations with digital technologies) but respondents generally look to feel more uncomfortable with it (57% that feels uncomfortable using the technology versus 38% in overall). the image contains a pie chart and a series of bar graphs. below, each element is described in detail. ### pie chart description the pie chart is labeled \"stance versus digital technologies,\" depicting the level of acceptance of digital technologies in dental offices. the chart is divided into segments representing different responses, along with their corresponding percentages: **38%**: the largest segment is marked as \"i feel uncomfortable and rather far from them,\" indicating that nearly 40% of respondents feel uneasy with digital technologies in dental offices. **41%**: this is the next largest segment, marked \"i am getting closer to them because i think they are the future of prosthesis,\" indicating that a significant portion of respondents recognize the importance of these technologies and are moving towards using them. **4%**: the smallest segment represents people who are using digital technologies and are comfortable with them. **13%**: another notable segment, representing those using digital technologies but feeling uncomfortable. the chart highlights a prevailing reluctance to embrace digital technologies among some respondents, balanced by a significant contingent that is increasingly accepting of them due to their perceived future importance in prosthetics. ### bar graphs below the pie chart, there are six vertical bar graphs corresponding to different countries, each divided into these four responses: 1. **germany (de)**: - 57% feel uncomfortable. - 23% are closer to using them because they are the future of prostheses. - 4% feel comfortable. - 13% reported using them but feeling uncomfortable. 2. **france (fr)**: - 47% feel uncomfortable. - 9% are getting closer because they see them as the future. - 4% feel comfortable. - 6% are using them but uncomfortable. - 6% feel completely comfortable but are using them. 3. **italy (it)**: - 55% feel uncomfortable. - 13% feel comfortable. - 4% are getting closer due to the future of prosthetics. - 28% reported using them but feeling uncomfortable. 4. **spain (sp)**: - 54% feel uncomfortable. - 17% are getting closer due to the future value in prostheses. - 3% feel comfortable. - 0% reported getting closer for use but feeling uncomfortable. 5. **united kingdom (uk)**: - 44% feel uncomfortable. - 4% are getting closer because they think they are future tools. - 5% feel comfortable. - 17% said they were using them but feeling uncomfortable. - 41% reported feeling uncomfortable overall, but there is no segment showing the percentage of those more comfortable. the bar graphs align and extend the information from the pie chart to provide insights into the acceptance levels in specific countries. overall, there is a prominent trend among dental practices, with a majority of respondents in all countries expressing discomfort with digital technologies, although some are either getting familiar with them or using them as perceived as a future necessity in dental practices. the image shows a pie chart and bar graph depicting dentists' acceptance and familiarity with digital technology in dental offices. the text explains various respondent sentiments towards the increasing use of digital technology, primarily in the context of dental practices in europe. the pie chart indicates the proportion of dentists' feelings on digital technology across europe and breaks down countries like denmark, italy, and the uk. the categories presented include: **i feel uncomfortable and rather far from them (12%)** this section illustrates dentists who feel uneasy and distant from digital technologies, with a notable percentage at 12%. **i am getting closer to them because i think they are the future of prosthetics (44%)** here, 44% of the dentists express that they are increasingly embracing these technologies as they believe they are the future of prosthetics. **i am using digital technologies because i need, but i am not comfortable with it (13%)** 13% of the dentists use these technologies out of necessity but report feeling uncomfortable with them. **i am using digital technologies and i am comfortable with it (17%)** 17% of dentists are comfortable using digital technologies for both their practices and procedures. **dont know (15%)** on the question of discomfort with digital technologies, 15% of the dentists are uncertain. additional observations from the accompanying bar graphs for individual countries (denmark, italy, the uk, and germany) reiterate the trends but highlight variability across these countries. for instance, denmark shows a higher percentage for those who are comfortable with digital technology compared to others, while the uk shows a marked percentage of dentists are getting closer to these technologies because they think they are the future of prosthetics. moreover, the text notes that the majority of respondents believe digital technologies will not replace traditional restorations but will play an increasingly important role, as evidenced by the higher percentages in italy and spain in using digital technologies in their practices. lastly, the context suggests a cautious yet evolving acceptance of digital technologies among dental professionals, primarily driven by the future trends in prosthetics and the need to modernize practice methods despite some initial discomfort.", "type": "Document"}}
