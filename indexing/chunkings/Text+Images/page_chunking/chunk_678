the one in the first image of the pair. this pie chart is displayed prominently in the center of the second image, and it is visually centered with no additional annotations or text. ### detailed description of the pie chart in the second image: **title and question context**: the pie chart sits in a question-answer format similar to the first image, which asks \"do you provide your patients with customized devices performed with 3d printing technologies, also in outsourcing?\" the question is part of a study or survey aimed at dental practitioners. **base sample size**: the chart is labeled with the base sample size of 301 cases, indicating that this data is part of a comprehensive survey of dental practices. **percentage breakdown**: the pie chart breaks down the responses into four categories with corresponding percentages: - the largest segment is dark blue, representing **74%** of dental practices that never use 3d printing. - a smaller blue segment represents **15%** of practices that often use it. - two adjacent smaller segments, both in light blue, represent **5%** each, for regularly and seldom uses of 3d printing technology. **legend and notation**: next to the pie chart, the legend is clearly labeled: - **dark blue**: never - **blue**: often - **light blue**: seldom, regularly **graphical elements**: each segment of the pie chart is marked with its percentage indicating the frequency of practice. the color differentiation aids in visually distinguishing each category. ### additional text elements: **source information**: at the bottom left of the image, there is a logo (omni vision) along with the word digital beside it. to the bottom right of this logo, the words \"clinic\" can be seen. **analysis note**: just below the main pie chart, a note suggests that the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant, which could indicate a margin of error or a specific statistical significance criterion applied in the study. ### overall layout: the design and layout are very professional, with clear and distinct sections. the elements are arranged logically to facilitate immediate understanding of the data presented. this visual representation encapsulates essential details from the first image and serves as an isolated view of the pie chart to provide a focused analytical description. the image contains a pie chart delineating the percentage of dental practices using 3d printing technologies, separated into two chronological phases: 2015 and the period of the complete study base. in the first section of the pie chart labeled \"2015,\" it shows 10% of dental practices used 3d printing technologies regularly, signified by the blue segment, while the large gray segment represents 90% of dental practices that never use 3d printing. this segment is labeled \"no 3d printer users,\" implying that a majority had no regular or frequent engagement with this technology. the second pie chart, at the bottom of the image, shows the entire sample from the study base of 281 dental practices. this chart is more dispersed with 74% not using 3d printing technologies at all (represented by the large gray segment), 15% using it seldom (represented by a smaller gray segment), 5% using it often (shown by a small blue segment), and another 5% using it regularly (implied by an even smaller blue segment). the blue shades indicate this information, with darker blue signifying higher usage. the legend in both charts uses color-coding: regular use (dark blue), often (medium blue), seldom (light blue), and never (gray). the data points suggest a fairly low overall adoption of 3d printing in dental practices as per this survey, with the majority of dental practices not using it regularly. the image contains a 3d-pie chart titled \"the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant.\" the pie chart provides data regarding the proportion of dental practitioners who use 3d printers. the chart is split into two sections: one section, labeled \"yes,\" is colored dark blue and denotes 26%. this section is relatively smaller and indicates that a smaller percentage (26%) of dental practitioners use 3d printers. the larger section, labeled \"no,\" is colored lighter and represents 74%. this predominant section shows a significant majority (74%) of dental practitioners do not use 3d printers. adjacent to the pie chart, there is additional information summarizing the differences between the usage of 3d printers before and after specifically, the text indicates that users might differ statistically by less than +/-2% and mentions that 3d printer users (and those outsourcing) come from: dental units with owners aged 35 or less (39% of 3d printer users, compared to 13% without owners aged 55 or older). dental units opening before 1999 (3% of users, compared to only 17% among those opening before 2018). dental units that have 3 or more units (41% of users, compared to just 40% among units with fewer units). units that see more than 50+ patients per week (41% of users, compared to those with fewer patients). dental units that utilize digital prosthetics providers (40% of users, compared to 33% among non-users). dental units owned by technologically-savvy individuals (53% of users, marked significantly higher than non-users). on the left side, a pie chart mirrors the data points above, showing that 74% do not use 3d printers. the image contains a pie chart illustrating the use of 3d printing technology by dental practitioners in the year the central question addressed in the image is \"do you provide your patients with customized devices performed with 3d printing technologies, also in outsourcing?\" the pie chart clearly segments the responses into two categories: \"yes\" and \"no.\" in the pie chart: the majority of the chart is covered by the segment labeled \"no\" which occupies 90% of the pie chart, represented in a dark blue color. the smaller segment is colored in light blue and is labeled \"yes,\" indicating that 10% of dental practitioners used 3d printing technology for providing customized devices to their patients. furthermore, the image in the top-right corner specifies that the 3d printer users (both within their own clinics and outsourced) have certain characteristics: age of the owner <= 45: 39% opening year before 1999: 17% opening year 1999-2018: 41% 3 or more dental units: 40% 50+ patients per week: 41% digital prosthesis providers: 40% digital technologies owners: 53% a note in red above the chart suggests that the differences in the percentages labeled with +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant, emphasizing caution when interpreting these precise figures. the overall contextual information provided by the chart suggests that, as of 2015, a vast majority of dental practices did not use 3d printing technology to make customized dental devices. for each case, the chart and adjacent infographic data points reflect a broader trend regarding the adoption of 3d printing in dental practices during that period.", "type": "Document"}}
