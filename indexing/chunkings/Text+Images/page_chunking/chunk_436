mean (euros) 1.659 1.533 total 415 352 the image contains a pie chart titled \"monthly amount allocated for consumable products purchase.\" it is specifically related to laboratory expenditures, excluding the purchase of precious alloys and equipment. the data is segmented into four categories with respective sizes represented in various shades of blue, gray, and one small section colored in dark blue. the largest segment, showing 31%, is colored in a light blue shade and represents expenditures from 1 to 5 laboratories. adjacent to this, a smaller deep blue segment accounts for another 29%, indicating expenditure from 6 to 10 laboratories. the segment representing the range of \"1 to 5 laboratories\" appears prominently because it is larger in area on the chart, suggesting a more significant proportion of laboratories in this range. another segment, slightly smaller in area but still substantial at 23%, is shaded in dark blue, representing expenditure ranging from 51 to 1000 laboratories. the final segment, colored in the darkest blue, accounts for 16% and represents laboratories expenditures that don't know or have no answer regarding the amount allocated. at the very bottom of this pie chart, the \"don't know/ no answer\" segment is notably distinct from the other major categories due to its color. below the pie chart, there is a bar chart that compares the mean expenditure values across different years. the bars are colored accordingly to match the pie chart segments. it represents mean expenditures in euros with different labels reflecting 2018, 2017, 2016, and the height of each bar correlates with the size of the pie chart segments. this allows comparison between the total expenditure and the proportionate spend for various ranges of laboratories. the y-axis values range from 1.823 (2018) to 2.700 (other unspecified year, likely representing 2019). each bar indicates the mean amount spent divided into the four categories of spending as depicted in the pie chart. additionally, at the bottom left of the chart, a table displays a summary with columns for trend analysis, 2018, and mean (euros) and total for each of the spending ranges. it details the percentage, values in euros, and total amounts broken down by category \"less than 500 ,\" \"from 501 to 1000 ,\" \"more than 1000 ,\" and \"don't know/ no answer.\" the values are cross-referenced in the corresponding bars and areas of the pie chart and bar graph to depict a robust and detailed representation of the data. the image contains a table titled \"monthly amount for consumable products purchase\" that appears to be a part of a larger infographic. this table is primarily meant to categorize and display the expenditures on consumable products for different regions of laboratories. the table is based on 588 cases from the whole sample and seems to be part of a survey or study analyzing expenditures among various laboratories. here is the breakdown of the content of the second image within the first one: the table is divided into seven columns, each corresponding to specific spending categories: 1. **up to 45 years old.** 2. **from 46 to 55 years old.** 3. **more than 55 years old.** 4. **before 1999 laboratory opening year.** 5. **from 1999 to 2017 laboratory opening year.** 6. **number of dental technicians.** 7. **number of served practices.** each column is further subdivided into three categories that reflect the amount spent per month on consumable products: 1. **less than 500 euros** 2. **from 501 to 1000 euros** 3. **more than 1000 euros** there are also instances of \"don't know / no answer\" represented by a grey shaded bar. the proportions in each category (represented as blue bars) indicate the percentage of respondents in each spending tier. data is provided for each category and group mentioned above, illustrating various spending habits across different segments of their surveyed population. the bottom of the table lists some statistical data, including a mean spend amount and the overall trend analysis for less than 500 euros, from 501 to 1000 euros, and more than 1000 euros. the overall message the table conveys is that different subsets of the laboratory respondents exhibit varied spending levels on consumable products, with some showing a tendency to spend more over time, as suggested by the table's trend analysis. this detailed content reveals crucial insights into the purchasing behaviors of different types of laboratories and helps in understanding trends in expenditure over certain segments of the study population. the image contains a collection of bar charts titled \"monthly amount for consumable products purchase,\" which is extracted from a page illustrated in the first image. the purpose of these bar charts appears to be to detail the distribution of annual consumable product expenditures across different categories. the bar charts are structured in an ordinal manner with each segment reflecting specific parameters, such as the age of the laboratory owner, the laboratory opening year, the number of dental technicians, and the number of served practices. each bar chart has four main categories represented by different colored bars, corresponding to the amounts spent on consumable products in four distinct spending ranges: 1. **less than 500 ** 2. **from 501 to 1000 ** 3. **more than 1000 ** 4. **dont know / no answer** each variable is plotted against one of these categories for a comprehensive visual representation of how expenditures vary with respect to each parameter. for instance, the first bar chart illustrates the trend in consumable product expenditures by laboratory owner age, segmented into up to 45 years, from 46 to 55 years, more than 55 years, and more than 65 years. other bar charts follow a similar structure to provide insights based on the opening year of the lab, the number of dental technicians, and the number of served practices, respectively. notably, the chart for 'more than 1000 ' ranges significantly higher compared to the others, especially in categories corresponding to older laboratories or more extensive practice settings. each bar denotes the percentage of dental practices falling into each spending category. these percentages underscore the financial habits of dental laboratories across different characteristics such as age and scale. the charts reveal trends and patterns, offering insight into how the monthly allocation for consumable products correlates with specific characteristics of dental laboratories. the inclusion of a dont know / no answer segment allows for acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in data collection, contributing to a realistic assessment of the data's completeness.", "type":
