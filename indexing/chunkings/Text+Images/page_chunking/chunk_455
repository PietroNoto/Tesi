if yes , which way? please, answer with (not related, rather not related, neutral, rather related, totally related) to the following statements. 30 base: 469 cases the changes are mostly related the increased use of aesthetic materials and the increase of fixed prosthetics versus the mobile prosthetics. note the 5 possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores among the items. the clustering is the following: not related: the scores grouped in this cluster are not related, rather not related. neutral: the scores grouped in this cluster are neutral, rather related. totally related is shown without any grouping. the image contains a smaller circular pie chart located near the bottom right of a page containing a larger circular pie chart and textual information. it is clearly part of the same overall data set and context, which appears to be from a survey or study concerning the use of digital technology in changing the type of restorations. this secondary pie chart corresponds to the \"yes\" responses to a primary question, labeled as 53%, indicating that 53% of the surveyed cases agreed with a particular statement regarding the impact of digital technology on restorations. the color scheme of this smaller pie chart is also blue and purple, continuing the stylistic consistency with the larger pie chart, which divides responses differently. the image contains two related bar charts on adjacent pages of a document which together convey data about changes in dental restoration methods. on the first page (image-1), several statements present a survey question regarding whether digital technology's use changes the type of restorations performed, and categories to answer this question are provided. the base is 469 cases. at the top, an arrow points to a pie chart with three categories: \"yes\", \"no\", \"dont know\". the pie chart shows that of the respondents, 53% chose 'no', 47% are undecided, and 6% are 'yes'. below the pie chart, a bar chart contains responses related to the material used: material used (zircon instead of alloy, crco instead of alloy): 6% 'no related', 57% 'neutral', 30% 'rather related', 7% 'totally related', and 0% 'dont know'. similar to those for the material used, there are bar charts for the types of restorations: more implant supported instead of tooth supported: 19% 'no related', 57% 'neutral', 16% 'rather related', 8% 'totally related', and 0% 'dont know'. more fixed instead of removable restorations: 10% 'no related', 55% 'neutral', 28% 'rather related', 7% 'totally related', and 0% 'dont know'. more screw retained instead of cemented: 26% 'no related', 51% 'neutral', 15% 'rather related', 9% 'totally related', and 0% 'dont know'. on the second page (image-2), further elaboration on the materials and types of restorations is conveyed through similar bar charts as in image-1, presented in a simpler format. it shows the responses without grouping them by categories like \"no related\" and \"rather related\". here: material used: 6% 'no related', 57% 'neutral', and 30% 'rather related' without subdivisions like 'totally related'. more implant supported instead of tooth supported: 19% 'no related', 57% 'neutral', and 16% 'rather related' without subdivisions like 'totally related'. more fixed instead of removable restorations: 10% 'no related', 55% 'neutral', and 28% 'rather related' without subdivisions like 'totally related'. more screw retained instead of cemented: 26% 'no related', 51% 'neutral', and 15% 'rather related' without subdivisions like 'totally related'. essentially, both images offer a detailed look into respondents' views on how digital technology influences whether dental restorations are made from specific materials and whether they are more implanted, fixed, or screw-retained. the second image is a set of horizontal bar charts, presenting survey responses to the question, \"in your opinion, does the use of the digital technology change the type of restorations? if yes, which way?\" the answers are classified into four categories: not related, neutral, totally related, and don't know. the bar charts depict the proportion of respondents who selected each category in response to three specific statements related to digital technology in restorations: 1) material used (e.g., zircon instead of alloys, crco instead of alloys), 2) more implant supported instead of tooth supported, and 3) more fixed instead of removable restorations. here's a detailed breakdown for each: 1. **material used (e.g., zircon instead of alloys, crco instead of alloys):** - not related: a majority of the responses, 47%, fall into this category. this suggests that for this specific usage of digital technology in restorations, the responses from practitioners feel not connected or not influenced by it. - neutral: 29% of respondents felt neutral about the impact of digital technology on this type of restorative material choice. - totally related: 14% of respondents find this change strongly influenced by digital technology. - don't know: 8% of respondents were uncertain about the impact. 2. **more implant supported instead of tooth supported:** - not related: the largest proportion, 57%, did not find any change in the use of implant supported versus tooth supported restorations due to digital technology. - neutral: 19% of respondents indicated a neutral stance. - totally related: 15% observed that digital technology led to more implant-supported restorations. - don't know: 9% were unsure about the impact. 3. **more fixed instead of removable restorations:** - not related: around 54% did not see a change in the preference for fixed versus removable restorations driven by digital technology. - neutral: this category makes up 15% of the responses. - totally related: 14% believe the shift towards more fixed restorations is due to digital technology. - don't know: 17% were not certain about the influence of technology on this type of restore. each bar segment visualizes the quantitative data for each category, with the percentage values and categorical labels making the analysis intuitive and clear. it is evident that the responses to whether digital technology changes the type of restorations are diverse, with significant portions of the respondents feeling that the changes are not related to digital technology or neutral about the impact.", "type": "Document"}}
