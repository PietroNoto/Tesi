t\u00e9cnica del sinterizado est\u00e1 presente en un n\u00famero de laboratorios inferior, pr\u00e1cticamente la mitad de elementos se producen con sinterizado y la otra mitad con fresado. el perfil de los laboratorios que producen usando una u otra t\u00e9cnica presenta algunas diferencias. en particular, al aumentar de la capacidad productiva del laboratorio aumenta de forma progresiva el peso de los elementos producido a trav\u00e9s de la sinterizaci\u00f3n. the image contains a circular statistical chart titled \"penetraci\u00f3n de las tecn\u00edcas,\" which translates to \"penetration of techniques.\" the chart is divided into two sections that illustrate proportions: the percentage of laboratories and the percentage of elements. in the top half of the circle, the chart displays the \"porcentaje de laboratorios\" (percentage of laboratories). **technique of sinterizing**: represented by a large blue section, the pie chart shows that 73% of the laboratories use the sinterizing technique. **technique of spraying**: represented by a small purple section, only 27% of the laboratories use the spraying technique. in the bottom half of the chart, the percentage of elements distribution is labeled \"porcentaje de elementos\" (percentage of elements). **technique of sinterizing**: a green segment indicates that 51% of produced elements were made with a sinterizing technique. **technique of spraying**: a small purple segment shows that 49% of the produced elements were made with a spraying technique. below these charts is a data table for \"distribuci\u00f3n de la producci\u00f3n\" (production distribution) in 2018 with percentages by numbering cases (25,1), sinterizing technique (12,2), and spraying technique (12,9). on the left side at the bottom of the image, there is a note stating \"base: 405 casos (hacen cad-cam)\" which means the data is based on 405 cases involving cad-cam (computer-aided design\u2014computer-aided manufacturing). to summarize, the image illustrates that out of the laboratories, 73% utilize sinterizing techniques while 27% utilize spraying techniques. for the produced elements, 51% are made with sinterizing, and 49% with spraying. there's a notable overlap as many elements produced with spraying are also produced by laboratories using sinterizing techniques. the image contains two pie charts and accompanying text detailing the adoption rates of cnc (computer numerical control) technologies in manufacturing, specifically focusing on processes like sinterizing and welding. the first pie chart, on the left hand side titled \"porcentaje de laboratorios\" (percentage of labs), presents information about the proportion of labs that utilize cnc technology. this chart is divided into segments of blue and gray, with two labeled arcs: \"s\u00ed\" (yes) in blue with 90% \"no\" (no) in gray with 10% the second pie chart, to the right labeled \"porcentaje de elementos\" (percentage of elements), shows the distribution of cnc elements. it is divided into smaller segments with various shades of blue and green. the labeled arcs are: \"s\u00ed sinterizado\" (yes sinterized) in blue with 51% \"s\u00ed fresado\" (yes machined) in a lighter blue with 49% adjacent to this chart, there is a bar chart displaying the distribution of cnc elements in 2018, broken down by technology categories: \"t\u00e9cnica de sinterizado\" (sinterized technique) with 12.2 elements and 48.5% of the total \"t\u00e9cnica de fresado\" (machining technique) with 12.9 elements and 51.5% of the total \"total\" with 136 parts, where the sinterized technique comprises 51.5% and the machining technique 48.5%, reflecting the distribution of 73% in favor of sinterized technology compared to the machine-processed. additional information in the textual content: \"73% de los laboratorios enterservados que producen procesis digital actualiza la tecnica de sinterizado, un porcentaje que se eleva al 90% cuando nos referrir un la tecnica de fresado.\" this highlights that 73% of labs producing digital processes now utilize sinterized technology, which will rise to 90% when referring to machining technology. the image contains a pie chart divided into two sections. one section, represented in green, occupies 51% of the chart, while another section, represented in a shade of grey, occupies 49%. there are no additional labels, data points, or other visual elements within this pie chart. the lack of any textual details suggests that the primary purpose of this pie chart is to simply represent the proportional distribution between the two sections, with the green section represented as the larger portion and the grey section as the smaller portion. it is clear that, visually, the green portion takes up more than half of the chart, suggesting a dominance or preferential focus on one category over the other. the image contains two distinct parts. the main body of the first image is a detailed infographic explaining production data regarding laboratory work in two distinct techniques: sinterized and fresado. this portion utilizes a combination of graphs, colored sections, and explanatory text. moving towards the lower section, there is a second simpler image, which appears to be a direct, text-only visual element. this image contains two labels: 1. \"t\u00e9cnica de sinterizado\" 2. \"t\u00e9cnica de fresado\" these labels are highlighted, indicating that they are likely the two primary categories the infographic is discussing in greater detail. the labels are formatted in bold and placed on a separate, plain white background, emphasizing their importance. the texts here are straightforward, without any accompanying numerical or descriptive data, as seen in the more complex infographic portion above. the choice to highlight these labels likely points to their significance in the overarching study or analysis being presented by the infographic.", "type": "Document"}}
