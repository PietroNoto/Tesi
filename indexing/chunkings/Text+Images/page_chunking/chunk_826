base: 722 cases among laboratories is more evident the difference in the stance versus digital technologies, between those using it already and the rest of the sample, not providing digital technologies at all. the difference is more evident when considering the comparison between full outsourcing users and other digital restorations providers. the image contains a series of questionnaires meant to gain insight into individuals' attitudes and perspectives regarding digital technologies in the prosthetics industry. specifically, these questionnaires aim to explore whether participants feel distant or close to digital technologies, the reasons behind their attitude, and their comfort levels with digital methods. at the top of the image, there are questionnaires laid out horizontally, each connected by color-coding for easy categorization. the questionnaire is designed to assess the user's stance on digital technologies by prompting responses to several statements or questions, each falling under one of the following categories: 1. **i feel uncomfortable and rather far from them**: this segment investigates individuals who have a sense of unease or separation from digital technologies. 2. **i am getting closer to them because i think they are the future of prosthetics**: this part gauges users' engagement and acceptance of digital technologies due to the belief in their significance and future role in prosthetics. 3. **i am using digital technologies because i need, but i am not comfortable with it**: this category quantifies the adoption of digital technologies out of necessity but while experiencing discomfort or uncertainty. 4. **i am using digital technologies and i am comfortable with it**: here, individuals are surveyed to understand their comfort and ease with the usage of digital technology in their work or profession. 5. **dont know**: this option is provided for respondents who are unsure or do not have an answer to the questions posed. each category lists varying responses. for example, under \"i am getting closer to them because i think they are the future of prosthetics,\" one possible response is \"65%,\" indicating that 65% of the respondents strongly agree with this statement. the second image, embedded within the first, is a pie chart, representing the distribution of respondents according to these questionnaire items. the segments within the pie chart represent different percentages of users' responses, illustrating the dominance of one attitude over another within the sample surveyed. the pie chart is divided into five segments, each represented by a different color, matching the color-coding above the questionnaires. each segment corresponds to one of the aforementioned questionnaire categories, visually representing how many respondents fall into each group. adjacent to the pie chart is a legend providing a direct correlation between the colors and what they represent. the colors and corresponding responses are: dark blue (uncomfortable and far) medium blue (futuristic engagement) light blue (needing but uncomfortable) white (comfortable using) gray (dont know) each segments size in the pie chart correlates with the percentage of respondents reporting that response. this visual format succinctly presents the distribution in a manner that allows for quick grasp of the prevailing sentiment or attitudes towards digital technologies in the prosthetics industry among the surveyed group. overall, the image provides a detailed analysis through both textual and visual means, combining questionnaires and a pie chart to understand the nuances and varying degrees of comfort, engagement, and acceptance individuals have with digital technologies in the context of prosthetics. the image contains a pie chart with segment labels indicating usage statistics of digital technologies in a laboratory setting. the chart is divided into five sections, each representing a different response, with corresponding percentages depicted. the pie chart shares similar content as the one in the first image but on its own, it provides the following insights: 1. **larger pie slice (42%)**: this segment represents respondents who feel uncomfortable but are transitioning closer to getting familiar with digital technologies due to the perceived future relevance of digital platforms in prosthetics. 2. **significant slice (29%)**: this slice indicates respondents currently using digital technologies due to necessity but still feeling uneasy about them. 3. **30% segment:** this includes those who are comfortable with digital technologies, divided into specific channels: - **in-lab millennials 26%**: indicates a significant proportion of younger individuals in the lab setting are comfortable with digital technologies. - **manufacturer 22%**: shows a middle range of respondents who are comfortable with the technology provided by manufacturers. - **full outsourcing 16%**: indicates a relatively lower percentage of those comfortable with full outsourcing solutions. 4. **largest slice (21%)**: these respondents are using digital technologies for comfort and are more familiar with the tools. 5. **1% slice (outliers in all sections)**: these small percentages likely represent respondents who either feel neutral or dont have strong feelings about digital technology integration. overall, the chart shows a nuanced understanding of the shift from discomfort to active use of digital technologies within a laboratory context, highlighting distinct responses and motivations for using digital tools in prosthetics. the image contains two vertical bar graphs displaying data related to the stance versus digital technologies scenario among labs. the content of the second image, which occupies the right upper corner of the first image, is displayed in a simplified format compared to the comprehensive chart in the first image. ### detailed description of the second image: *layout and structure:** the chart appears in a straightforward format, with a total of five categories listed vertically on the x-axis. each category is associated with two vertical bars for different responses. the categories from left to right are \"no,\" \"yes,\" \"in-lab milling,\" \"scanner,\" \"full outsourcing,\" \"manufacturer,\" and \"partner lab.\" *content analysis:** 1. **category - no:** - **digit. restor. provider:** - 65% (blue bar) - **technology:** - 12% (blue bar) 2. **category - yes:** - **digit. restor. provider:** - 39% (blue bar) - **technology:** - 83% (blue bar) 3. **category - in-lab milling:** - **digit. restor. provider:** - 43% (blue bar) - **technology:** - 22% (blue bar) 4. **category - scanner:** - **digit. restor. provider:** - 6% (blue bar) - **technology:** - 16% (blue bar) 5. **category - full outsourcing:** - **digit. restor. provider:** - 53% (blue bar) - **technology:** - 13% (blue bar) 6. **category - manufacturer:** - **digit. restor. provider:** - 67% (blue bar) - **technology:** - 24% (blue bar) 7. **category - partner lab:** - **digit. restor. provider:** - 46% (blue bar) - **technology:** - 10% (blue bar) *additional notes:** each category has a small segment bar to indicate the percentage contribution from the \"no\" response. the second image highlights responses to varying levels of automation or digital integration, as identified by specific technology implementation metrics within lab scenarios. the data is color-coded in blue, with dark blue representing higher percentages and lighter blue representing lower percentages concerning which respondents are using (or plan to use) digital technologies. the second image essentially reflects a cross-section of responses on technology adoption amongst different types of technologies and partner lab relationships, providing specific insights into their stance on digital and non-digital approaches in lab environments.", "type": "Document"}}
