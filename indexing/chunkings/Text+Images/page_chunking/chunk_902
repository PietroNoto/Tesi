(whole sample) 67% of the interviewed laboratories use a management software. the use is higher among younger technicians, in the most recent labs and in the largest ones. also among those technicians who perceive the future of the laboratory in a positive way, the use of these programs is more frequent. customized laboratory management software the image contains the logo and trademark symbol of \"ivoclar vivadent.\" the logo consists of the word \"ivoclar\" combined with the word \"vivadent\" underneath it in a modern and straightforward font style. the primary color used for the text is blue, which conveys a sense of professionalism and reliability. the \"ivoclar\" part of the logo features an italicized typeface, while \"vivadent\" includes a regular font, providing visual contrast and drawing attention to both parts of the branding. above the words \"ivoclar\" and \"vivadent,\" there are three small green dots that form a partial circle. this green color choice, along with the dot pattern, implies a sense of growth, innovation, or a holistic approach. these dots are stylistically minimalistic but add a touch of uniqueness and modernity to the overall design. to the right side of the logo, there is a trademark symbol () in a standard, small font, indicating the legal protection of the brand. the use of this symbol is common for companies and organizations to signify their registered trademark status. the logo overall is clean, professional, and distinct, easily recognizable and conveying a strong corporate identity. the use of blue, green, and simple geometric shapes emphasizes a company that values clarity, innovation, and an approachable professionalism. the image contains a pie chart and additional information about its findings. the chart displays the distribution of laboratory management software usage among a sampled population, with two distinct sections marked \"no\" and \"yes.\" in the pie chart, the section labeled \"no,\" representing 33% of the sample, is colored in purple, highlighting a minority segment. the larger section labeled \"yes,\" which signifies that 67% of the sample use laboratory management software, is color-coded in blue. below the pie chart, there is a breakdown of data based on demographic factors such as the age of the laboratory owner, the year the laboratory opened, the number of dental technicians, and the number of served practices. this structured data provides additional context, indicating that certain factors influence the likelihood of laboratories using management software more than others. the accompanying text explains that 67% of interviewed laboratory owners utilize laboratory management software, with the prevalence being notably higher among younger technicians, those in more recently established labs, and larger labs. furthermore, it suggests that this trend will persist into the future due to the positive perception of these programs. the chart also cites the base sample size of 588 lab owners, along with a summary bar graph and logos from sponsoring companies (omnivision digital and key-stone), adding an organizational and commercial context to the presentation. this composite graph serves as a visual and numeric summary, combining the pie chart with interpretative notes to detail the statistical results, context, and implications. the image contains a detailed bar graph titled, \"laboratory management software,\" showing the distribution in the use of management software among different groups of dental laboratory owners. specifically, the graph is a continuation from the first image, and it breaks down the usage of laboratory management software by various criteria. the categories displayed are: age of the laboratory owner (up to 45, from 46 to 55, more than 55) laboratory opening year (before 1999, from 1999 to 2017, 1, 2, 3 or more) number of dental technicians (up to 5, from 6 to 10, more than 10) number of served practices (19% of these categories) for each category, the graph shows the percentage of laboratory owners that use management software, with the percentages being stacked and combined at each bar to provide the total. starting from the top-left, the bars corresponding to each age group show the following percentage distributions: up to 45: 76% of use, broken down with 24% (no), and 53% (yes) from 46 to 55: 70% use, with 30% no, and 47% more than 55: 70% use, with 34% no, and 53% next, looking at laboratory opening year, the distribution is: before 1999: 64%, with 29% no and 36% from 1999 to 2017: 71%, with 29% no and 48% 1 year old lab: 52%, with 48% no 2 year old lab: 63%, with 37% no 3 or more years old lab: 81%, with 19% no the number of dental technicians indicates: up to 5: 60%, with 40% no from 6 to 10: 60%, with 40% no more than 10: 81%, with 19% no finally, the number of served practices shows an even distribution with: 19% use management software each category is detailed in a clear way, allowing for easy comparison among different demographic factors related to dental laboratories.", "type": "Document"}}
