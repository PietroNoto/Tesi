offer to enhance / improve the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your clinic? 30 random sample the spontaneous answers, among them the most quoted ones are affordability and better financial conditions, have been aggregated according to their nature into five areas and considering the responses instead of the respopndents as the base, with the exclusion of dont know and not interested. this data processing allows for further comparison among the different clusters. base: 455 cases total sample the image contains a bar chart breaking down the factors respondents from a survey identified as most important in purchasing cad-cam products. the chart is formatted to compare the percentage of respondents prioritizing different factors for purchasing cad-cam equipment. the specific categories and their corresponding percentages are clearly labeled and visually represented using horizontal bars of varying lengths. the most emphasized factor in this survey is \"high affordability\" at 49%, followed by \"training courses\" at 39%, and \"guarantee continuous customer service\" at 29%. the other factors, such as \"better financial conditions,\" \"pay per scan\" option, \"facilitate shared purchase, as a consortium,\" \"marketing for the patient,\" and \"cooperate with other service providers,\" reflect additional preferences by the respondents. a notable feature of the bar chart is that it is divided into categories with red highlights indicating the focus areas. the image has a clean and informative layout, with each factor distinctly separated and labeled for easy readability. along with the percentage values, the bar chart provides a visual snapshot of what buyers consider essential when making a cd-cam (computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing) purchase. the image contains a pie chart labeled \"demand for services to support the investment in cad-cam,\" which was part of a survey focused on the services required to support cad-cam technology investments. the pie chart is illustrating the percentage distribution of responses across various categories. the pie chart is divided into five sectors, each differentiated by color and labeled with the following categories and their respective percentages: 1. **economic and financial conditions (45%)**: this is the largest segment, highlighted in light blue, indicating that it is by far the most dominant category. 2. **training and support (35%)**: represented by the dark orange/red segment. this category is slightly smaller than the first. 3. **consortiums and partnerships (13%)**: indicated by the light green segment. 4. **marketing for the patient (7%)**: represented by the grayish color, showcasing a smaller portion. 5. **system improvement (4%)**: the smallest section, colored in deep blue. additionally, there is an inset figure in the first image in the upper-right corner that shows an aggregated distribution pie chart of the categories based on the respondents without aggregating the \"don't know\" and \"not interested\" responses, as noted in the image below the main chart. overall, the image shows that economic and financial conditions play the most significant role (45%) among cad-cam technology buyers when considering services to support their cad-cam investments out of the five categories listed. the image contains a pie chart segmented into various categories, representing the demand for services to support the investment in computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manufacturing (cad-cam). each sector of this pie chart is color-coded and assigned a percentage value, illustrating the various factors that influence such investments across three distinct areas. the categories and their corresponding colors in the chart are as follows: **economic and financial conditions**: represented by a blue segment and accounting for 45% of the total demand. this category indicates that financial conditions are a prominent concern for those considering investments in cad-cam technology. **training and support**: displayed in orange, this category accounts for 35% of the demand. this suggests that the need for professional training and ongoing support is significant. **consortiums and partnerships**: represented by a yellow segment accounting for 13%. this indicates that forming alliances or collaborating with other entities is a substantial factor influencing cad-cam investments. **marketing for the patient**: illustrated in green, this category makes up 7% of the demands. this indicates that marketing efforts to patients may have a limited role in influencing investment decisions. **system improvement**: shown in red, this category represents 4% of the demand. it suggests that the need for improving existing systems or adding features is a modest yet crucial aspect. in addition to these categories, there is a smaller bar graph in the upper left corner containing various reasons for considering cad-cam technology investments. the main points from this bar graph are: high affordability (49%) training courses (39%) guarantee of continuous customer services (29%) better financial conditions (23%) \"pay per scan\" option (14%) consortium and purchase partnerships (14%) marketing for the patient (14%) cooperate with other service providers (11%) future value guaranteed in case of re-purchase of similar equipment (3%) high reliability and precision (2%) open system (0%) simplify the planning (0%) product test (0%) i'm not interested anyway (15%) also included in the image is a footnote detailing that the data is based on a \"random sample\" of 455 cases. the total sample is noted to be the same number, emphasizing it is the entire dataset being examined. the overall presentation suggests an in-depth analysis of which factors are most significant when considering cad-cam investments in a medical or clinical context. the combined view of both the pie chart and bar graph offers detailed insight and aids in understanding the multifaceted nature of the decision-making process regarding such technological investments.", "type":
