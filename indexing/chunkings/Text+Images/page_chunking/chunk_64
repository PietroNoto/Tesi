25 clinic + labo laboratorios cl\u00ednicas con respecto al 2015, va aumentando considerablemente la necesidad de mayor informaci\u00f3n y formaci\u00f3n. disminuye, por otro la \u201cpresi\u00f3n sobre los precios\u201d, que parec\u00eda m\u00e1s relevante en el estudio anterior. the image shows a bar graph derived from a study that compares the characteristics valued by both \"clinicas\" (clinics) and \"laboratorios\" (labs) in terms of digital technology providers' offerings. the data is presented in two categories: \"clinica + labo\" combines the values of both clinics and labs, and \"laboratorio\" specifically shows lab values. the graph is color-coded with brown representing values from 2018 and yellow representing values from key features of the bar graph include: 1. **orientation**: the x-axis represents various characteristics deemed important, such as \"formaci\u00f3n, informaci\u00f3n, prueba productos, simplificaci\u00f3n\" (training, information, product testing, simplification), \"precios convenientes\" (convenient prices), \"nada, no estoy interesado\" (i don't care for anything), \"mejorar las relaciones\" (improving relationships), \"mejorar las\u6027\u80fdes\" (improving performance), and \"otro\" (other). the y-axis shows the percentage of respondent values with varying heights indicating the importance given to each characteristic. 2. **comparative data analysis**: - **formaci\u00f3n, informaci\u00f3n, prueba productos, simplificaci\u00f3n**: the most critical aspect for both clinica and lab data in 2018 is training, information, product testing, and simplification, with 53% and 43% for \"clinica + labo\" and \"laboratorio\" respectively. this demonstrates that the demand for information and product integration remains high. by 2015, this factor retained significant importance with 38% and 39% respectively. - **precios convenientes**: convenient pricing holds a significant second position for clinics (40% for clinics in 2018, 22% for laboratories), indicating affordability is a major factor for customers in both categories. in 2015, this value was 40% for clinics and 39% for labs. - **nada, no estoy interesado**: it shows a lower interest level over time. for \"clinica + labo,\" it decreased from 2015 to 2018 (15% to 7%), and for laboratories, from 17% to 7%. - **mejorar las relaciones** (improving relationships) and **mejorar las performancees** (improving performance): only 6% and 4% of clinics preferred these aspects by 2018, lower than previous trends of 6% and 8% in labs saw a minor drop, from 3% to 2% and 2% to 0%. - **otro**: remains a minor yet notable aspect, with 5% for \"clinica + labo\" and 7% for labs in 2018. *insights**: overall, the graph highlights that the integration and streamlined processes of digital solutions, combined with convenient pricing, are significant for both clinics and laboratories, with less emphasis on specific personal relationships or less defined enhancements. this data could be crucial for technology vendors to tailor their offerings based on these observed trends. the image contains a bar graph that compares the characteristics preferred by providers of medical laboratories in the years 2015 and 2018 regarding the use of digital technology. the graph is divided into two sections: one for clinics and another for clinic + lab, indicating a breakdown by type of facility. each section includes features rated by the providers and their corresponding percentage from the years 2015 and the background of the bars alternates between yellow for 2015 and brown for 2018 to visually differentiate the data from each year. 1. **clinics** - **formaci\u00f3n e informaci\u00f3n (training and information)**: - 2018: 53% - 2015: 38% - **precios convenientes (convenient prices)**: - 2018: 22% - 2015: 40% - other features not explicitly named here, like \"nada, no estoy interesado\" (i am not interested in anything), \"mejorar las relaciones\" (improving relationships), and \"mejorar las performance\" (improving performance), have small percentages: - 2018: 3%, 8%, 0% - 2015: 17%, 20%, 3% - the \"otro\" (other) category: - 2018: 1% - 2015: 1% 2. **clinic + lab** - **formaci\u00f3n e informaci\u00f3n (training and information)**: - 2018: 43% - 2018: 39% - **precios convenientes (convenient prices)**: - 2018: 22% - 2015: 36% - other features: - \"nada, no estoy interesado\" (i am not interested in anything): - 2018: 18% - 2015: 17% - \"innovaci\u00f3n y mejora de las performance\" (innovation and improvement of performances): - 2018: 15% - 2015: 7% - \"servicio al cliente\" (customer service): - 2018: 2% - 2015: 2% overall, the larger picture is that digital technology preferences have declined year over year for clinics and laboratory clinics. notably, training and information as well as convenient prices have decreased most significantly, while the importance of providing customer service has remained consistent.", "type": "Document"}}
