**intra-oral scanners:** the bar for \"dentsply sirona\" is the longest, followed by \"align technology,\" \"maestros 3d,\" \"3m,\" \"3shape,\" and \"dental wings\" sequentially, with a small bar for \"roland.\" the lowest bars are for \"straumann,\" \"amann girrbach,\" \"strumann,\" \"maestros 3d,\" and \"dental wings,\" respectively. this shows a marked dominance of \"dentsply sirona\" in this category. - **chairside milling units only:** \"dentsply sirona\" and \"roland\" are the most common in this category, with \"dentsply sirona\" significantly more prominent. smaller bars for \"align technology,\" \"3m,\" \"amann girrbach,\" and \"dental wings\" are present. - **chairside milling units including scanners:** the length of \"dentsply sirona's\" bar is greater than \"align technology\" with \"dentals wings\" and \"3m\" representing smaller portions. *graphical elements:** the bars are colored uniformly in all three categories, using a blue color scheme. no vertical axis label is visible, but the proportional length of the bars indicates data differences between the brands. ### analysis with context from the first image: 1. **intra-oral scanners for digital impressions:** - from the bar lengths, \"dentsply sirona\" leads significantly in intra-oral scanners used for taking digital impressions. this aligns with a more extensive market presence and brand recognition in dental laboratories, reflecting its position as a leading vendor in this segment. 2. **chairside milling units only:** - \"dentsply sirona\" also dominates in chairside milling units, showing it may offer integrated or specific solutions that cater better to dental mill units directly for such specializations. \"roland\" appears less frequently compared to \"dentsply sirona.\" 3. **chairside milling units including scanners:** - this category shows the extensive usage of \"dentsply sirona\" compared to \"align technology.\" it implies that while \"align technology\" might be effective in intra-oral scanning, \"dentsply sirona\" offers a more complete solution catering simultaneously to both intra-oral scanning and chairside milling needs. the prominence of \"dentsply sirona\" in all three categories suggests a strong market presence and user preference or brand confidence in various segments like intra-oral scanning and chairside milling. this can be attributed to a range of factors including product quality, brand reputation, and integration of services that cater to comprehensive dental mill solutions. other brands like \"align technology,\" \"3m,\" and \"3shape\" show strong but lesser presence, reflecting established, albeit competitive, market shares in targeted services or digital technology in dental impressions and milling. the image contains a bar chart that displays the results of a survey regarding the digital tech brand that dental chairside milling units owners are using. it illustrates the percentage of survey respondents identifying dentsply sirona as the dominant brand. the chart is presented in a simple, horizontal bar format, with each brand labeled horizontally along the x-axis. the following brands are prominently displayed from top to bottom: dentsply sirona roland zirkonzahn don't know/no answer the y-axis is categorized in increments marked, although specific values are not visible. each bar's length corresponds to the proportion of respondents who chose each brand, with dentsply sirona having the longest bar, indicating a large majority preference. the bars for roland and zirkonzahn are shorter and roughly of similar length, while the \"don't know/no answer\" category has an almost full bar, suggesting the largest unidentified percentage. notably, there is a prominent grey bar representing the \"don't know\" category above the brand names, visually emphasizing the significant percentage of respondents who didn't have an answer or chose to remain anonymous when asked about their specific brand. this section is a clear and distinct part of the chart which, in turn, sets a comparative context against the selected brands. overall, the chart effectively communicates the dominance of dentsply sirona in the surveyed group of dental chairside milling unit owners, underlines a significant percentage of uncertainty or undisclosed responses, and highlights lesser-known brands roland and zirkonzahn as lesser competitors in this particular survey context. *chain of thought (cot) analysis for clarity:** 1. **dentsply sirona leads with a significant bar length, showing it is the most chosen brand among respondents.** 2. **roland and zirkonzahn are also important, showing a relatively equal presence among the respondents who did not select a brand.** 3. **the \"don't know/no answer\" category has a substantial bar**, showing that a large portion of respondents either did not know the brand or chose not to disclose, making this a critical figure in understanding the data limitations and respondents' reluctance to specify. by providing a detailed description, the essential elements are conveyed accurately, ensuring that all parts of the bar chart, including the brands, their comparative lengths, and the \"don't know/no answer\" section, are understood. the image contains a bar chart titled \"digital technologies: equipment numeric distribution - ranking.\" it appears to be extracted from a page that discusses the popularity or usage percentage of various dental scanner brands. in detail, the bar chart represents a ranking based on the number of respondents who use specific scanner brands. the x-axis lists the names of scanner brands, while the y-axis indicates a percentage that represents how commonly each brand is used. the bars extend across the y-axis to indicate the level of usage percentage for each brand. the brands and their relative sizes of the bars from top to bottom are as follows: dentsply sirona align technology straumann 4. 3shape 5. 3m amann girrbach dental wings maestro 3d roland zirkon zahn there is also a horizontal gray bar towards the end of the chart labeled \"don't know / no answer,\" indicating that some respondents did not provide an answer. above the bar chart, a subtitle reads, \"what is the brand of your scanners/airside milling units? overall.\" under this, there are three charts stacked side by side, each representing different contexts: \"intra-oral scanners to take digital impressions,\" showing usage percentages for intra-oral scanning. \"chairside milling units only,\" indicating usage for chairside milling units. \"chairside milling units including scanners,\" indicating usage for chairside units that include scanning capabilities. these charts have different base quantities and show varying percentages for the same brands as seen in the combined overall ranking bar chart. each bar in these categories represents usage data from different surveys or responses, and they might indicate how each brand compares across varying types of dental milling units. overall, the bar chart visually demonstrates the dominance of dentsply sirona in the overall usage of dental scanning equipment, as it has the longest bar, reflecting the highest percentage among the respondents. align technology follows, albeit substantially lower than dentsply sirona. the other brands are substantially smaller, indicating lesser usage percentages.", "type": "Document"}}
