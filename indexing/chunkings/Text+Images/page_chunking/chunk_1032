owners the image contains an internal graphic element which is a simplified, stylized icon against a solid, muted yellow background. the icon features three stick figure human representations arranged in a line. each figure is depicted with a minimalistic approach, characterized by simple black lines that outline their shapes, heads, bodies, arms, and basic clothing features. the central figure, presumably in the middle, depicts a woman wearing a dress with a bow on the back, possibly indicating her gender. furthermore, the figures seem to be placed in a manner where each one mirrors the next, giving a sense of symmetry and order. the heads are represented by simple black circles with minimal facial features such as dots for eyes and a line for a mouth. the bodies and limbs are similarly stylized with basic geometric lines and shapes, devoid of detailed features or textures. due to the nature of the icon, it is open to interpretation, but often such figures are used in a professional or generic context to avoid stereotyping specific individuals. the icon does not provide contextual details about the group's environment, environment, or activities, relying instead on the universally understood symbolism of stick figures to represent people. the image contains a pie chart that illustrates the percentage of respondents' intentions to buy an intraoral scanner or a cad-cam a within 2 years, excluding practices that already possess cad-cam technologies. it is segmented into different colors to represent various responses: 'certainly no' (dark blue), 'probably no' (medium blue), 'probably yes' (light blue), 'certainly yes' (green), and an undefined category represented by a light color. the dark blue segment, representing 'certainly no,' accounts for 34%, the medium blue for 'probably no' for 32%, the light blue for 'probably yes' for 28%, and the green for 'certainly yes' for 6%. additionally, there is a section labeled 'don't know, no answer' in orange (2%). above this pie chart are two blocks of text. the first block indicates that 33% of the respondents answered 'certainly yes' or 'probably yes' to the intention to buy within 2 years. the second block, to the right of the pie chart, explains that the higher intent to purchase the cad-cam technology comes from clinics with dentists younger than 55 (38% for those younger than 45 and 36% for those aged between 45 and 55) and for practices with larger scales, with more than 3 chairs (47%). further, it mentions that practices with better performances spending more than 900 per month and those placing more than 50 implants a year declare a higher attitude to the purchase of a cad-cam system. below this pie chart is a footnote stating that the survey base was 410 cases and is noted as \"non-owners random sample.\" to the right, there are two circular icons. one is labeled '38% for dentists younger than 55,' and the second is labeled '53% for practices with more than 50 implants per year' with respective illustrative silhouettes of dentists and chairs in the clinics representing these demographics. overall, the accompanying text and iconography serve to give a comprehensive understanding of the varying influences on the purchasing intent of cad-cam technology in the dental industry. the image contains a pie chart displaying a survey's results related to dental practices' intention to buy an intraoral scanner or a cad-cam chair-side milling system within two years. the chart does not explicitly label the sections but uses different colors to differentiate various response options. ### breakdown of the pie chart (second image): 1. **32% (dark blue)** - represented by \"certainly no\" indicating that 32% of dental practitioners do not have any intention to purchase the mentioned systems within the specified timeframe and exclude those that already possess such technologies. 2. **28% (light blue)** - \"probably no\" signifies that 28% do not see a strong likelihood of purchasing the systems in the upcoming two years. 3. **34% (blue)** - \"probably yes\" reflects that 34% of respondents are likely to consider buying the systems within this timeframe. 4. **5% (gray)** - \"certainly yes\" indicates a small subset of 5% who are very certain they will make a purchase within two years. 5. **2% (green)** - \"don't know, no answer\" shows that 2% were uncertain and unresponsive to the question, possibly due to lack of awareness, inability, or hesitation to commit. ### interpretation in context: these results offer insights into the market penetration and adoption rate of cad-cam technology among dental practitioners. the significant minority with \"certainly no\" and \"probably no\" (91%) implies low intent to invest in these technologies within the next two years, possibly reflecting concerns over costs, competition, or existing workflow efficiencies. conversely, the moderate number of \"probably yes\" respondents (34%) suggests a readiness to look into cad technology, potentially indicating trends like advancing digital techniques, patient demand, or economic incentives. the minuscule portion of \"certainly yes\" shows a dedicated few who anticipate integration swiftly, hinting at forward-thinking or aggressive business strategies. ### analysis: **economic considerations**: practices with high performance and high spending capacity might be more inclined towards immediate investment due to their superior financial flexibility, potentially benefiting from higher initial outlay through quicker adoption. **age and experience**: younger practitioners and those with less tenure might favor emerging technologies owing to a keen interest in modernization and innovation. in contrast, more experienced professionals may be more cautious due to the perceived steep learning curve and perceived costs. **market strategy**: practices with larger size configurations (\"36% for dentists younger than 55\" and \"47% for practices with more than 3 chairs\") might have better resources prioritizing investment timely, offering greater capacity to afford and integrate new technologies. such pie charts provide detailed yet quick visual summaries that are pivotal for healthcare market planners to tailor strategies, allocate investments, and predict future demands based on precise, granular data
