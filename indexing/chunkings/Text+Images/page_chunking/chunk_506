this segment is the largest portion, accounting for 39% of the total production. 2. **from 21 to 50 elements** - this accounts for 37% of the chart. 3. **more than 50 elements** - this segment represents the smallest portion, totaling 24% of the chart. the title and accompanying text question how many elements for fixed prostheses (in metal ceramics, all ceramics, or composite) on average are produced in a week by the laboratories. this question is part of a larger trend analysis that the image includes at the bottom of the page, comparing data from the years 2013 to the total average number of elements per week is highlighted, showing an overall decrease from 652 in 2013 to 648 in data on fixed prostheses in ceramics or composite as distinct as well as the total fixed prostheses provided are also illustrated in a table format. additionally, the page includes a detailed analysis of the impact of various factors such as the age of the laboratory owner, the number of technicians, and monthly purchases on the production of fixed prosthetic elements. it provides specific percentages and correlations between these variables and the production volume of elements. for instance, 87% of laboratories producing fixed prosthetic elements are from younger (<=45 years) laboratory owners, and 86% have served more than 10 laboratories per month. theres also a comparison of monthly purchases, showing that those with less than 500 monthly purchases are more common but less productive on average. the image shows the graphical and numerical details in a cohesive and analytically insightful manner, aimed at those interested in dental prostheses production statistics and trends. the image, titled \"fixed prosthesis in ceramics or composite,\" is an infographic from omnivision digital detailing survey statistics on fixed prosthesis production in various dental laboratories. the survey likely pertains to dental professionals worldwide, examining the frequency of fixed prosthesis production, including fixed prosthesis in ceramics or composite, ceramic veneers, and overall production weekly. *detailed analysis of the second image:** 1. **graph segment description:** - the image contains a horizontal bar graph that illustrates data gathered over two years, 2017 and the x-axis represents the number of ceramic fixed prosthesis provided, categorized into three ranges: \"up to 20,\" \"from 21 to 50,\" and \"more than 50.\" - the y-axis signifies the frequency, with bars corresponding to the numerical intervals of fixed prosthesis provided monthly. 2. **data interpretation:** - **up to 20:** the 2017 data reveal 7.5% of the provided ceramics fixed prosthesis fall into this category. the bar for 2018 shows a slight increase but remains close, indicating about 8.5% of fixed prosthesis produced fell into this frequency range. - **from 21 to 50:** this is a significant portion of the production, indicating the most common range. in 2017, approximately 55.8% of ceramics fixed prosthesis production falls within this segment. by 2018, the percentage is nearly identical, close to 55.5%. this indicates stability in this range over the observed period. - **more than 50:** the least common category, with 36% in 2017 and a slight decrease to 36.3% in this suggests that while a significant number of prosthesis is being produced, they are not typically going out as high quantities within this timeframe. 3. **trend analysis (text table):** the table next to the bar graph provides a summary of trends in ceramic fixed prosthesis production: - **total ceramic fixed prosthesis in 2018:** 79.5% - **total ceramic fixed prosthesis in 2017:** 81.5% these figures highlight a slight decline in ceramic fixed prosthesis production. 4. **production and demographic trends (text box):** - **overall mean fixed prosthesis:** the infographic further categorizes these production data into overall statistics (above, below specific averages, up to, from, and more than certain intervals per week, month, and lab owners age and size). - **overall mean fixed prosthesis production:** details range of different intervals concerning the production frequency and scale. - **overall mean fixed prosthesis production per laboratory owners age and size:** statistics regarding the production scale based on lab owner's age and size, indicating how fixed prosthesis production changes with lab size and owner statistics. *integrated insight in context:** the infographic gives a comprehensive overview of ceramic and composite fixed prosthesis production, showing stability within certain frequency ranges. the observed slight decline in production might signal an evolving trend towards specific technologies or material preferences in the industry. the insights into lab sizes and owner demographics provide further context on how business size and owner factors impact production scales. by aligning production scales with different lab owner demographics, the infographic effectively highlights the varied economic and operational scales within the industry.", "type": "Document"}}
