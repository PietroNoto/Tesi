16 use of digital technologies breakdown by technology and channel the portion of the sample providing digital restorations was requested to specify how they do that. chart use of digital technologies breakdown by technology the most common way to produce digital restorations is to produce scan files (55%) to be sent outside to an external organization (either a partner lab or a manufacturer/milling center). a good portion of the sample uses at least a milling unit installed at their laboratory (34%). chart use of digital technologies breakdown by technology europe vs. breakdown per country germany, france and the uk are the countries showing the highest percentage of respondents stating to use at least one scanner to send the scan files outside for milling procedure. the same is with regard to the milling unit used at the laboratory, while the lowest one is spain, which also shows the highest percentage of full outsourcing users. the image contains a horizontal bar chart from the key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015 executive summary indicating the breakdown of digital restorations by technology and channel. the chart is divided into the following components: 1. **category labels**: - in-lab milling - scannier - full outsourcing 2. **percentages distributed by mode of production**: - **in-lab milling**: the majority of digital restorations (34%) are produced using in-lab milling. - **scannier**: the highest percentage, 55%, of digital restorations are produced using scannier technology. - **full outsourcing**: 23% of digital restorations are produced through entirely outsourcing these services. 3. **usage breakdown by production methods**: - **milled in house**: - 8% of digital restorations are manufactured within the house. - corresponding subcategories: - plaster models sent to partner labs: 19% - plaster models sent to manufacturers/milling centers: 8% - **scans sent to partner labs**: - represented by \"scans sent to partner labs\" bar showing 19%. - corresponding subcategories: - scans sent to manufacturers/milling centers: 47% - plaster models sent to manufacturers/milling centers: 8% - **scans sent to manufacturers/milling centers**: - represented by the highest bar at 47%, signifying the substantial number of digital restorations produced by sending these scans to manufacturing or milling centers. each category is differentiated by the distinct percentage it represents out of the whole, and these percentages are visually communicated through horizontal bars of varying lengths, with dark blue denoting higher percentages and lighter hues representing lower percentages. the chart provides a clear visual breakdown that highlights the main production methods and the technology employed within each channel. the image contains a bar chart titled \"use of digital technologies breakdown by technology country\" from key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015 - executive summary - the chart compares the usage of digital technologies across two categories: \"in-lab millling,\" \"scanner,\" and \"full outsourcing,\" within the context of five countries: de (germany), fr (france), it (italy), sp (spain), and uk (united kingdom). each country's usage trends are represented in three bars: in-lab millling (shown in dark blue) scanner (shown in light blue) full outsourcing (shown in blue-green) for each country: **germany (de):** - in-lab millling: 44% - scanner: 65% - full outsourcing: 3% **france (fr):** - in-lab millling: 41% - scanner: 43% - full outsourcing: 30% **italy (it):** - in-lab millling: 19% - scanner: 37% - full outsourcing: 46% **spain (sp):** - in-lab millling: 47% - scanner: 33% - full outsourcing: 61% **united kingdom (uk):** - in-lab millling: 16% - scanner: 61% - full outsourcing: 47% the bar chart's y-axis indicates the percentage of users of each technology, ranging from 0% to 66%, and countries are listed on the x-axis. there's an additional bar on the first chart (\"use of digital technologies breakdown by technology and channel\") in the top-left corner, showing detailed usage trends for various digital restoration technologies sent to different entities like \"mill\" (in-house), \"scans\" (sent to partner labs), and \"plaster\" (sent to manufacturers/milling centers). the text below the chart explains that the most common method of producing digital restorations is producing scan files sent outside, with germany, france, and the uk being the leading countries for in-lab milling processes. the highest percentage of full outsourcing is attributed to the uk, and the lowest to spain.", "type": "Document"}}
