73 base: 179 cases (digital prosthesis providers) since practices may use different technologies and channels, the sum of percentages is higher than 100%. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. since the digital prosthesis providers have almost doubled with respect to 2015, the following chart shows the penetration of the different technologies (or flows) calculated on the whole sample. as regards the technologies, set aside the quite stable penetration of the chairside milling units, it is relevant the growth of both the scans sent outside (from 5% to 10% in 2018), and the use of traditional impressions sent outside (from 30% to 60%) for milling. percentage of dental practices - digital users only percentage of dental practices - whole sample clinic base: 281 cases (whole sample) the image contains a detailed bar chart that illustrates the breakdown of different dental technologies used for digital restorations. this data is presented within the context of a larger report on digital technology use in dental practices, as indicated by the titles and supplementary notes within the first image. the bar chart specifically focuses on the percentage of dental practices using various technologies for restoration and is based on a sample of 281 cases. each bar represents a different type of technology used in dental practices: 1. **chairsidemilling**: - the chart shows 5% of dental practices used chairsidemilling in 2015. - by 2018, this percentage rose to 5%. 2. **scans**: - in 2015, 5% of dental practices utilized scans for digital restorations. - the utilization increased to 10% in 2018. 3. **impressions**: - this chart indicates that in 2015, 30% of dental practices used impressions. - by 2018, the percentage grew to 60%. 4. **non-users of digital technologies**: - in 2015, 36% of dental practices did not utilize any digital technologies for restorations. - this number dropped to 35% in the bars are color-coded to differentiate between the years: - **blue bars** represent data from 2015. - **green bars** represent data from 2018. - **purple bars** represent non-users of digital technologies. an important note in the image states that the differences between 2015 and 2018, which are +/-2%, are considered not statistically relevant, which suggests that trends in the adoption of digital technologies were relatively stable over the observed periods. the image contains a simple bar graph titled \"chairside millings\" and provides a direct visual representation of the percentage of dental practices utilizing a particular dental technology for scans and impressions. specifically, the graph includes data on where digital scans and impressions are sent in dental settings. the bar graph includes the following specific percentages: 1. **chairside millings**: represented by a single percentage bar at 7%. 2. **scans sent to other partner labs**: denoted by a bar that reaches up to 15%. this represents the percentage of digital scans sent to another dental lab. 3. **scans sent to manufacturers / milling centers**: illustrated by a slightly larger bar at 6%, showing the distribution of scans sent to manufacturing or milling centers. 4. **impressions sent to other partner labs**: the longest bar, at 91%, indicating that 91% of impressions are sent to another dental lab. 5. **impressions sent to manufacturers / milling centers**: represented by a bar that reaches 30% of the height of the other partner lab bar, indicating a significant portion of impressions sent to either manufacturers or milling centers. this graph is part of a larger document discussing digital technology usage among dental practices. the text at the top indicates it is from dhi, and there is an additional note specifying that the analysis encompasses 281 cases in a whole-sample group. the breakdown provided in the image aims at illustrating the varying channels through which dental practices submit their digital scans and impressions. the chart is divided into two sections by technology type. on the left, data is segregated by dental technology usage; on the right, these data points are represented in another format, showing the percentage of dental practices within a larger sample. this detailed graph forms part of a larger study aimed at comprehending the patterns and distributions followed by dental professionals in handling scans and impressions, revealing insights into digital workflow management within the dental industry.", "type": "Document"}}
