75 18% of those not performing fixed prosthetics using digital technologies plan to start within a year. this percentage increases among laboratories with three or more technicians (31%) and among those declaring a positive perception with respect to the future of their business (27%). if, on one hand, the intention to buy have increased remarkably in recent years - in 2012 only 7% of those not providing digitally produced prosthesis declared they would have done - with the wide spreading of the digital technology, still there seem to be a hard socket of those somehow adverse to it, as the very slight change from 2015 (16%) to 2018 (18%) demonstrates. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. base: 159 cases (not providing digital restorations) 2015: 25 cases intention to buy intention to buy the image contains a bar chart showing the percentage of respondents who are planning to start using digital technologies for fixed prostheses within the next year. according to the chart, the following are the reasons provided: yes, because we are going to purchase digital equipment: 10% yes, because we will recur to external partners (partner lab, milling centers) to produce prosthesis with digital technologies (full outsourcing): 8% no: 82% the bar for \"no\" indicates that a significant majority of respondents are not planning to start within a year. the second set of data, shown below the bar chart, indicates different percentages for the year 2015, with only 16% intending to buy and 84% choosing not to buy. the context suggests the widespread adoption and significant interest in digital advancements in prosthetics. the image contains a circular pie chart and additional supporting text placed within the first image, which appears to be a page from a report or paper on digital technology adoption trends in laboratories. the pie chart is positioned above the primary text on the page, serving as a visual representation of data. # detailed content of the circular pie chart: ## components of the pie chart: 1. **yes (18%)**: this section is identified in blue and occupies a relatively small part of the circle, indicating that 18% of respondents intend to buy fixed prostheses elements produced with digital technologies (cad-cam / 3d printing) within the next year. there's a legend or caption placed under the pie chart on the right. 2. **no (82%)**: this large purple section fills most of the circle, showing that 82% of the respondents do not intend to buy fixed prostheses elements made with digital technologies in the upcoming year. the size of this section visually conveys the majority sentiment. 3. **legend**: beneath the pie chart, there is a legend providing additional context. the \"yes\" and \"no\" segments from the pie chart are color-coded and matched correctly to their respective categories. there's a brief explanation of the intention to buy ratio. ## surrounding text: **main headline**: the section above the pie chart reads, \"technology intention to buy.\" **question addressed**: the main question posed to the respondents, are you planning to start providing fixed prostheses elements produced with digital technologies (cad-cam / 3d printing) within the next year? **percentage breakdown**: additional details are provided in the form of a bar graph next to the pie chart. the bar graph offers a clear percentage breakdown: - 10% for those saying they will purchase digital equipment. - 8% for those planning to recur to external partners for full outsourcing. **additional information**: - text notes that \"82%\" have no intention to buy using digital technology. - it emphasizes a slight increase in adoption since 2015. - mentioned are certain percentages related to laboratories with specific numbers of staff. - there are references to case data with footnotes indicating a base of 159 cases from the year without full digital implementations. ### legend explained in the image: according to the legend directly under the pie chart titled \"intention to buy\": **15 cases - yes 16%**: refers to the base of 159 cases with 16% respondents indicating a positive intention to buy. **75 cases - no 82%**: refers to cases where respondents state they don't intend to buy, covering 82% of the 75 cases. the combined visuals and text aim to summarize and present the data clearly, illustrating the relative intentions of respondents regarding the adoption of digital technologies in laboratories using a pie chart and text explanation. the image contains a pie chart titled \"intention to buy\" specifically addressing the intention to purchase fixed prostheses elements produced with digital technologies (cad-cam / 3d printing) within the next year. the chart is part of a larger document discussing digital restorations in the dental industry. the pie chart is divided into two sections: a small segment in blue at the top indicates a 16% proportion of respondents who intend to buy these types of prostheses within the next year. a larger segment in dark blue at the bottom accounts for 84% of respondents who do not intend to buy these products within the next year. adjacent to the pie chart, text explains that among laboratories with three technicians or more (31%), and among those declaring positive perception regarding the future of their business (27%), the intention to buy has notably increased. the document provides context for the chart by including data from two time periods: 2015 with 25 cases 2018 with 89 cases the larger bar chart below the pie chart further elucidates the trend showing an 8% increase in the number of labs planning to purchase in 2018 compared to the number in alongside, the accompanying narrative suggests the growth is influenced by the broader adoption and positive outlook towards digital technologies despite lingering challenges and skepticism among some professionals. the text also emphasizes the importance of this shift, acknowledging that a significant portion of those currently not providing digital-provided prostheses intend on starting within a year. this statistic is particularly important for stakeholders considering investments and technological upgrades in the dental restorations sector.", "type": "Document"}}
