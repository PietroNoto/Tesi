(low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) the items on the upper right side of the map, very close one to each other, will be further investigated on the factor analysis, which allow an in-depth analysis on a reduced number of variables and a more qualitative interpretation. the image contains two primary panels. the first panel to the left is a comprehensive breakdown of a correlation analysis map titled \"brand image vs recommendation - correlation analysis map\". this panel divides a two-dimensional plane into four quadrants based on two axes: weight on recommendation and item score (or pricing). the vertical axis is labeled 'weight on recommendation' ranging from \"low\" to \"high\", and the horizontal axis is labeled 'item score' ranging from \"low\" to \"high\". the various points denote particular characteristics of item recommendations. the second panel to the right is a more simplified form of the same correlation analysis map, showing part of the data points from both dimensions of weight on recommendation and item score without the quadrant breakdown. specifically: \"too expensive\" is situated in the lower-left corner where both the weight on recommendation and item score are low. \"affordable\" is at a lower middle position but with a moderate to higher item score. points for \"good price quality ratio\" are clustered towards the middle-upper sections of the item score and weight on recommendation dimensions. \"leading company\" is positioned towards the right side, indicating a higher weight on recommendation. characteristics like \"innovative and at the forefront\", \"reliable\", \"makes daily practice easier\", \"highly reputable\", \"trustworthy,\" and \"worldwide renowned\" are all located more towards the upper right side of the graph indicating they correlate with higher item scores and high weight on recommendation, thus indicating these items are recommended more based on higher scores. each of these points is clearly marked and can be interpreted from the coordinate grid, providing insights into what factors affect customers' recommendations and the perceived quality of the products represented.", "type": "Document"}}
