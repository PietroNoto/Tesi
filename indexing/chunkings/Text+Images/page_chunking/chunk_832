the image contains text in blue and gray that lists the types of dental technicians or external laboratories with which dental practices may cooperate: - **1** (depicted in blue) - **2** (also in blue) - **3 or more** (depicted in a lighter shade of blue) - **don't know / no answer** (represented in gray) 2. **layout and visual emphasis:** - the layout is simplistic, meant for clarity and ease of reading. the shades of blue are used to represent different categories while the gray shade is used for uncertainty or unknown responses. - the image uses colored squares of varying sizes to correspond to the statistical distribution, with larger blue squares possibly indicating more common responses and smaller, less frequent ones. 3. **statistical insight:** - while the exact numbers are not specified in the image, it's implied that the design is meant to correlate with another statistic, such as the mean or median, which should align with other datasets seen in presentations or reports related to dental laboratories. - the exact data values are not numerically visible in the cropped section shown, but usually, images like this correspond to parts of tables or graphs that display the results of surveys or data analysis. 4. **purpose and context:** - this part of the image relates directly to the context of the larger presentation seen in the first image titled \"number of dental technicians and laboratories.\" it appears to be a visual representation of how surgical practices within dental clinics coordinate or have coordination agreements with external labs or technicians. 5. **design choices:** - the use of a clear font and simple color coding aids readability and quick comprehension, suggesting the information is meant for quick visual analysis or for integration into comprehensive reports. in summary, this second image appears to be part of a detailed presentation focusing on dental practices' cooperation with external dental technicians or laboratories, displaying how frequent surveys or statistics are categorized and visually represented for easy understanding. such imagery is typical in professional dental presentations or educational materials aimed at analyzing and comparing collaborative practices within the field. the image contains a circular pie chart split into two sections with colored shading. the majority of the chart is filled with a deep blue color, which represents \"no,\" indicating that 90% of the sampled group or individuals do not use a technician from the lab as per their survey questions. a small triangular colored section in a lighter hue, indicating \"yes,\" makes up the remaining 10% of the pie chart. there is a corresponding legend at the bottom of the graph that matches the color shading, explaining the meaning of the \"yes\" and \"no\" sections of the pie chart. the \"yes\" section is identified by a light blue shape, while the \"no\" section is represented by a darker blue shape. there is a question mark in the middle of the pie chart, suggesting a query about whether respondents work with an external laboratory or in-house with technicians.", "type": "Document"}}
