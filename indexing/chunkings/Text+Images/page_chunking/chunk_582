37 mean by analysing the percentage of quotes of the positive scores (partially and fully agree) it is clear that two out of three are the most relevant items, explaining that the respondents expect an increase in the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow, and a wider range of materials available. trend analysis % of agree y. 2018 (agree) y. 2015 (yes) 80% 81% 80% 78% 41% 34% base: 282 cases (whole sample) the image contains a line diagram with three circular nodes connected linearly. the nodes are colored green, with each containing a number: \"4,2\" at the first two nodes and \"3,2\" at the last node. these numbers appear to represent some form of data or statistics, although the exact nature of these values is not specified within the confined context. the connecting line is also green, maintaining a consistent color scheme throughout. the background is white, and the nodes and connecting line are designed with a slight 3d effect, providing a sense of depth on a flat surface. the image contains two distinct graphical representations, each related to the perceptions of professionals on the impact of 3d printing in dentistry. the second image is an isolated pie chart that segments the responses of professionals with colored blocks. this specific chart seems to be part of an analysis comparing three different statements regarding the consequences of 3d printing in dentistry: 1. \"the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden the types of restorations that can be done.\" 2. \"the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase.\" 3. \"the costs of the restorations will decrease.\" each pie chart section is color-coded as follows: **dark blue**: fully agree **blue**: partially agree **yellow**: neutral **light blue**: partially disagree **red**: fully disagree here's a detailed interpretation of each segment based on the colors: 1. **fully agree**: - 43% - this segment is the largest portion, indicating that a significant number of respondents (31.3% total) or more completely agree with the statements. they likely see the potential of 3d printing in increasing efficiency, making more restorations possible, and decreasing costs. 2. **partially agree**: - 38% - just slightly smaller than the fully agree segment. this means that more respondents (30.8% total) are partially supportive of the viewpoints. they may acknowledge some benefits but also see potential limitations or conditions. 3. **neutral**: - 16% - a smaller group compared to the agree segments, this 16% represents those who neither strongly support nor oppose the statements. these respondents are less engaged or don't feel strongly about the presented consequences yet. 4. **partially disagree**: - 4% - this relatively small segment shows that 4% of respondents (3.1% total) are partially disagreeing with the statements. they likely see some flaws or limitations that slightly outweigh the perceived benefits of 3d printing in dentistry. 5. **fully disagree**: - 1% - the smallest segment, indicating that only 1% (0.9% total) strongly disagree with the effects of 3d printing. this suggests minimal opposition based on professional consensus. overall, the pie chart provides a clear numerical distribution of responses across the three statements, showing a significant leaning towards agreed posities. the image contains three sentences that address different aspects of how 3d printing can impact the field of dentistry. these three statements are listed vertically, each representing a key outcome or improvement anticipated to be brought about by the introduction of 3d printing technology in dentistry. the first sentence discusses the expansion of materials and procedures that can be digitally produced. it suggests that the broader range of digital materials and techniques will make dentistry more versatile and capable of producing diverse products needed in dental treatments. the second sentence highlights the increased efficiency and flexibility of the workflow in dentistry. this advancement is expected to streamline processes, making it quicker and easier to perform various dental procedures. the third sentence mentions cost savings in the dental restoration process due to the lower price of materials used in 3d printing compared to traditional cad-cam blocks. using 3d printing appears to result in more affordable treatment solutions for consumers. overall, these statements collectively emphasize the transformative potential of 3d printing in enhancing the materials available, improving workflow efficiency, and reducing costs in dental practices.", "type": "Document"}}
