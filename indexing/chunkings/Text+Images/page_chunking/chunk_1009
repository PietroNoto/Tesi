the pie charts are circular and divided into segments, each representing the percentage share of different materials. - there is a key on the right-hand side of the charts indicating the color coding for each material: - cobalt chrome (dark green) - titanium (olive green) - zirconia (light green) - ceramic glass (lighter green) - pmma acrylic materials - wax - other materials 2. **details of the pie charts**: - the left chart (overall production - total processing) shows the following distribution: - cobalt chrome: 43% - titanium: 36% - zirconia: 10% - ceramic glass: 5% - pmma acrylic materials: 2% - wax: not represented - other materials: not represented - the chart indicates that cobalt chrome and titanium are the dominant materials, making up roughly 79% of total production in this category, while zirconia and ceramic glass contribute smaller segments. - zirconia takes up a substantial 10%, indicating its significant role in the processing of these elements. - the right chart (overall production - definitive elements only) shows the following distribution: - cobalt chrome: 47% - titanium: 39% - zirconia: 10% - ceramic glass: not represented - pmma acrylic materials: not represented - wax: not represented - other materials: not represented - this chart specifically highlights the use of cobalt chrome and titanium, accounting for a combined 86%, leaving the other materials with minimal presence. - zirconia is shown with a notable 10%, albeit slightly reduced from the left chart. 3. **presentation and context**: - both charts utilize a clean and clear design for easy understanding. - the charts are labeled \"omnivision digital\" and \"key-stone,\" possibly indicating different periods or data sets for material analysis. - the overall context suggests an analysis of material composition in ceramic tile production, useful for stakeholders in understanding material usage trends and distribution. - the charts provide insights into how materials are prioritized during both the total processing phase and the definitive element production phase, giving a comparative view of material utilization. 4. **visual elements and data representation**: - labels and legends are strategically placed for clarity, ensuring that each segment of the pie charts corresponds to a specific material. - the color coding ensures that each segment is distinctively marked without confusion. - slight percentage differences between the two charts highlight variables in material usage between the total processing and definitive element phases, which could be critical for manufacturing strategies and resource allocation decisions. the image contains a pie chart which represents the distribution of different materials used in the production of cad-cam (computer-aided computer-aided manufacturing) elements. the title question pertains to the percentage of elements produced with particular materials, focusing particularly on \"overall production\" of these elements. the pie chart is divided into four segments: 1. **cobalt chrome**: - represents the largest portion of the chart, occupying around 47% of the entire production. cobalt chrome is a very popular material in prosthetic element production for its durability, resistance to corrosion, and its biocompatibility. 2. **titanium**: - occupies about 39% of the pie chart. titanium is prized for its light weight, strength, and its ability to withstand high temperatures, making it a suitable material for prosthetic elements. 3. **tirconia**: - represented by about 10% of the total. this material, often used in prosthetics due to its compatibility with skin, is made up of aluminum oxide, a natural mineral. 4. **ceramic glass**: - making up the smallest portion at approximately 4% of the total. ceramic glass is used for its smooth, high-gloss finish and durability, though it is less often found in prosthetic elements compared to the other three materials. the chart helps visualize that cobalt chrome is by far the most frequently used material in this production context, followed by titanium and tirconia in descending order by usage percentage. ceramic glass is the least used of the four materials analyzed. furthermore, it is specified that these distributions relate to \"overall production\" and do not include pmma or waxes, focusing solely on the \"definitive elements\" as mentioned. this detail underscores the importance of the materials used in the specific, finalized stages of production.", "type": "Document"}}
