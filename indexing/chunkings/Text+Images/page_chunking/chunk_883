psychographic analysis 45 in this map, some psychographic profiles are present. by analyzing the nearness factor, its clear how as the positive attitude and feeling towards the digital technologies increase, also increases the relationship of the recommendation with this item. generally speaking, the recommendation seems to be more linked to the nearness concept, while the reputation, except for the respondents stating that the relationship will become tighter, seems to have a lower grade of relevance. the position of digital important but not relevant is affected by germany, which showed the majority of responses belonging to this item, and whose position in the previous slide is very similar. its interesting to note that the difference in the feeling feel uncomfortable and feel closer is resolved by the nearness, which helps a lot in increasing the comfort towards the new technology. less relevant nearness more relevant less relevant reputation more relevant this map analyses where some different profiles are positioned, if the nearness concept has an impact on the recommendation, or if the driving factor is the reputation. the image shows a positioning map that illustrates the impact of various psychographic profiles on the recommendation and reptation of digital technologies within a specific context. this positioning map is part of a broader analysis that delves into the relationship between different psychographic types and their attitudes towards the adoption of digital technologies. the positioning map is positioned right within a larger frame that includes textual explanations and other positioning maps. specifically, the map focuses on the \"narrowness\" and \"reputation\" axes. points marking different psychographic profiles are scattered across these axes, each connected to a phrase that represents the attitudes or behaviors driven by the psychographic profile. the vertical axis represents the level of reptation (or trust/stability), ranging from \"i feel uncomfortable\" at the bottom to \"i feel closer\" at the top. the horizontal axis represents how pertinent digital technologies are to the industry or profession, with \"will not be any change\" on the far left and \"i feel uncomfortable\" on the far right. key points within the map include: 1. **digital importance but not relevance**: positioned towards the \"i feel uncomfortable\" end horizontally but somewhat closer on the reptation axis. representing profiles where digital is seen as important, but not relevant, thus creating an uneasy blend between digital and current practices. 2. **digital not relevant in the future**: closer to \"will not be any change\" horizontally, and closer to \"i feel comfortable\" vertically. indicates profiles that believe digital advancements will have no major impact in the future, thus maintaining established practices. 3. **relationship will become tighter**: positioned towards the center-right of the map, this represents profiles seeing an integration of digital tools to improve professional practices and relationships. 4. **dentist will make more prosthesis**: a specific point in the map that may tie in to industry-specific behaviors, suggesting that certain digitally skilled professionals expect more collaboration or specialization in their digital application. 5. **digital will replace traditional**: positioned to the far right but relatively closer to reptation, indicating significant discomfort with traditional practices being replaced entirely by digital technology, with a reluctance to embrace new methodologies. 6. **digital will take on a more proactive role**: closer to reptation on the vertical axis, suggesting a higher level of trust in digital advancements and expecting them to play a more active role in future practices. 7. **more cooperationtech/doc**: implies a closer relationship between technology and documentation (or patient records), representing a scenario where more collaboration is expected between digital tools and professionals in the industry. additionally, the surrounding textual explanations provide context to these points. notably, the map clarifies how psychographic profiles with higher \"narrowness\" and higher \"reputation\" may influence their relationship with digital technologies more favorably, leading to a tighter cooperation. in summary, the map serves as a visual representation highlighting different attitudes towards digital adoption among various psychographic profiles, illustrating both their comfort level with new technologies and their belief in their relevance for industry practices.", "type": "Document"}}
