orange: 17% - blue: 31% - mean: 4.3 2. **highly reputable** - orange: 20% - blue: 37% - mean: 4.2 3. **innovative and at the forefront** - orange: 25% - blue: 39% - mean: 4.1 4. **leading company** -

worldwide renowned: 4.3 - highly reputable: 4.2 - innovative and at the forefront: 4.1 - leading company: 4.0 - reliable: 3.9 the next section shows the mean values for a different set of statements towards the bottom of the chart, displaying: - makes daily practice easier: 3.0 - customer service oriented: 3.5 - good price quality ratio: 2.4 - affordable: 2.9 these statements are rated from the fourth through the seventh rows of the graph. lastly, three statements from different categories are also listed, illustrating a distinct trend and lower scores: - too expensive: 3.0 - trustworthy: 3.2 - recommendable to colleagues: 3.5 from a clustering perspective, the mean values for each statement are grouped from low to high, with \"affordable\" (2.9) at the lower end, followed by \"makes daily practice easier\" (3.0), and then \"too expensive\" (3.0) indicating a mix of slightly relevant or slightly irrelevant responses. in summary, the clustered bar chart visualizes the varying relevance of different brand statements, providing a detailed look at consumer perceptions of each brand being analyzed. the overall trend shows that statements related to \"worldwide renowned\", \"highly reputable\", and \"innovative and at the forefront\" generally receive higher means, while \"affordable,\" \"too expensive,\" and \"makes daily practice easier\" tend to receive lesser, more neutral to slightly irrelevant ratings. the image contains a list of attributes associated with overall brands as per the data collected from a survey. the list is segmented into two parts: one on the upper side under the subheading \"overall brands,\" and the other on the left side as standalone text without any additional context. in terms of the upper side: the title reads \"omnivision clinic\" at the top. below this is \"brand positioning: overall brands\" in bold text followed by a brief introductory sentence. the survey asks respondents to indicate their opinion about several statements using a rating scale, ranging from \"not relevant\" (represented in orange) through \"completely relevant\" (in blue). the attributes listed include: - worldwide reknown (ranked 51% with 4.3 mean) - highly reputable (ranked 43% with 4.2 mean) - innovative and at the forefront (ranked 36% with 4.1 mean) - leading company (ranked 38% with 4.0 mean) - reliable (ranked 32% with 3.9 mean) - recommendable to colleagues (ranked 29% with 3.8 mean) - trustworthy (ranked 22% with 3.8 mean) - too expensive (ranked 30% with 3.7 mean) - makes daily practice easier (ranked 24% with 3.7 mean) - customer service oriented (ranked 23% with 3.5 mean) - good price quality ratio (ranked 21% with 3.2 mean) - affordable (ranked 8% with 2.9 mean) on the left side, the list of brand attributes is given without the specific percentages and means associated with them, but it mirrors the list on the upper side. these include: worldwide reknown highly reputable innovative and at the forefront leading company reliable recommendable to colleagues trustworthy too expensive makes daily practice easier customer service oriented good price quality ratio affordable the image then explains that there are five possible answers that have been further clustered for better score highlighting among the evaluated brands. these clusters are not relevant, partially relevant, neutral, quite relevant, and totally relevant. the paragraph on the bottom left describes the reason for the clustering and briefly mentions the total relevance of the factors. finally, the overall data indicates that attributes like being \"worldwide reknown\" and \"highly reputable\" are highly significant, with higher mean scores, suggesting that these factors are particularly important to the respondents' perception of overall brand quality.", "type": "Document"}}
