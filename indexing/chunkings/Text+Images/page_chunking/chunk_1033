excluding practices that already possess cad-cam technologies 24 random sample base: 410 cases non owners the purchase intention is double among those who already uses the full outsourcing, compared to those who do not offer digital work flow prostheses 38% vs 17%. the analysis of the sample stratification allows for a precise profiling of the potential buyers to develop marketing activities on, in order to increase demand generation. the image contains an icon representing an \"interodal scanner\" or cad-cam mill. the icon appears in two places: in the upper right section of the page in the first image and within a larger, circular orange icon in the right-side section of the same page. the icon depicts a rectangular clipboard with lines, indicating it is for checking off items or tasks. on this clipboard, there are five checkmarks. the first four checkmarks are arranged vertically along the top of the clipboard, and the fifth checkmark is placed slightly below the middle of the clipboard, creating a visual hierarchy. around these checkmarks, two additional chevron symbols are placed: one pointing upwards, above the four vertical checkmarks, and another pointing downwards, below the horizontal fifth checkmark. these chevrons likely signify progress or achievement. the clipboard itself is enclosed within a larger, circular orange border, accentuating its importance within the context of the page. the icon is also accompanied by a label that reads \"interodal scanner,\" identifying the purpose of the depicted item. the color scheme involves orange, white, and dark gray (or black). the orange color is bold and draws attention, while the white and dark gray outline provides clarity and contrast, enhancing the readability of the icon. additionally, the second image is positioned strategically to support the central theme mentioned in the main text of the first image, which discusses the intention to buy an intraoral scanner and stresses the significance of users already applying full outsourcing. notably, the icon's imagery emphasizes organization, systematic checking, and progress, which aligns with the strategic planning and evaluation needed when considering buying industrial equipment or adopting new technologies in a business context. the placement of the icon and its symbolic elements (checkmarks and chevron) serve to reinforce the idea of careful planning and the benefits of full outsourcing for ensuring effective demand generation and user readiness. the image contains a chart from a presentation slide titled \"intention to buy.\" this chart outlines responses from a survey regarding respondents' willingness or interest in buying an intraoral scanner or a cad-cam chairside milling within two years, excluding practices that already possess cad-cam technologies. the chart is split into two categories: \"no digital users\" and \"full outsourcing only.\" both categories list five responses, corresponding to different degrees of certainty in the respondents' intentions. these responses are: 1. **dont know, no answer** (represented by grey bars) 2. **certainly yes** (represented by dark blue bars) 3. **probably yes** (represented by light blue bars) 4. **probably no** (represented by orange bars) 5. **certainly no** (represented by dark orange bars) for \"no digital users,\" the chart indicates responses with the following percentages: 53% certainly no 29% probably no 15% probably yes 6% certainly yes 7% dont know, no answer for \"full outsourcing only,\" the chart indicates responses with the following percentages: 28% certainly no 32% probably no 32% probably yes 6% certainly yes 2% dont know, no answer key points to note are: 1. **the purchase intention is double among those who already use full outsourcing** compared to those who do not: this is a highlighted statement on the slide indicating a specific difference noted by the survey results. the analysis of sample stratification is intended to profile potential buyers to increase demand generation. additionally, the slide includes a pagination note at the bottom showing page number 24 and a slide footer indicating \"key-stone\" with a logo, which seems to be associated with the presenters or sponsors related to the slide content. the image contains a table split into two sections, labeled \"no digital users\" and \"full outsourcing only\". each section reflects the responses to a specific question regarding the intention to buy an intraoral scanner or a cad-cam chairside milling within 2 years, excluding practices that already possess cad-cam technologies. the color-coding represents the percentage of respondents who answered each possible response to the survey question: \"are you willing/interested in buying an intraoral scanner or a cad-cam chairside milling within 2 years?\" there is an additional note stating that the purchase intention is double among those who already use the full outsourcing, compared to those who do not, with the full outsourcing users at 38% versus 17%. *left image section (no digital users) analysis**: the \"certainly no\" response has the highest percentage at 53%, colored in dark blue. the \"probably no\" response has 29%, represented by a lighter blue shade. \"certainly yes\" is at 15%, shown in light blue. \"probably yes\" has 2% of respondents, which is depicted in the darkest blue shade. *right image section (full outsourcing only):** \"certainly no\" is at 28%, in dark blue. \"probably no\" shows 32% in a lighter blue shade. \"certainly yes\" is now the highest in this section with 32%, indicated by a medium blue. \"probably yes\" has 6%, shown in a light blue color. key observations show that the difference in purchase intention is striking between those two categories: in the left section with no digital users, a vast majority strongly disapproves (53%) for purchasing within two years. in the right section of full outsourcers, the \"certainly yes\" response nearly matches those who strongly disagree (28%). the \"probably yes\" column in no digital users is relatively low compared to the full outsourcing only column.", "type":
