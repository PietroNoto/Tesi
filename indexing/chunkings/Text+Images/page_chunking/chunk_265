influence of independent variables (in this case, current and former users) over the dependent one (in this case, overall satisfaction). it was used to quantify the ratio between score and individual factors and evaluation over recommendation. therefore, it is possible to retrieve an \"importance hierarchy\" of individual demonstrations and to show them in a chart and, then, in a map. the vertical axis always shows the rating that the different instructions have received, in an average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence over the global recommendation. thus, we get an \"estimated importance\" of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a little different of that explicitly declared. the analysis of each factor's weigh, and not only the stated importance, allows some interesting considerations. the items have a different meaning according with the viewpoint with which they are considered: 56 statistical grade recommendation before the whole market: here we can emphasize some prerequisites (each upper right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors are before the market), some key factors to success (lower right corner of the map, where the companies are not always able to be recommended regarding strategical matters), and indifference areas (lower left corner), that constitute waste/inefficiency areas when a company decides to invest in such items belonging to the upper left corner of the map, since they are prone to meet the market, but they really do not affect the overall recommendation. recommendation regarding a specific company: here the scheme is the same, but the strong points are highlighted in the upper right corner of the map, where we can establish the inefficiency or low differentiation when placed in the left side of the map. in the lower right corner we can notice an improvement area, where we can meet the weak points of a given company. the image contains a venn diagram with four overlapping circles labeled \"prerequisites,\" \"key success factors,\" \"waste/inefficiency,\" and \"indifference.\" each circle has a different color: prerequisites in blue, key success factors in pink, waste/inefficiency in gray, and indifference in green. the central area where all four circles overlap is labeled \"key success factors.\" inside this central section, each circle's label is in a smaller font and lighter shade compared to outside the overlap. the intersecting sections of the circles indicate the areas where prerequisites and key success factors are both important, key success factors and waste/inefficiency overlap, key success factors and indifference overlap, and prerequisites and waste/ineefficiency overlap. each of these overlapping sections represents a critical intersectional area. the layout on the page demonstrates a statistical grade and correlation analysis, suggesting a focus on identifying where particular variables (like prerequisites, key success factors, waste/inefficiencies, and indifference) intersect and overlap, highlighting areas of overlap and key findings in these variables. other relevant points highlighted on the page detail the importance of understanding these overlapping areas, as they can affect recommendations and the overall evaluation of factors within the context of statistical assessment. the second image, located within the first image, displays a statistical grade model consisting of overlapping circles arranged in a quadrant layout. the circles are each colored differently and are labeled with specific terms, dividing the plane into various regions. in detail, the model includes circles with four main labels: 1. **waste/inefficiency**: this label is on a grey circle located in the lower-left quadrant, indicating sectors that are generally unfavorable when considering strengths and weaknesses. 2. **strength points**: this label is on a light blue circle within the upper-right quadrant, suggesting these are favorable areas for a subject, such as a company or strategy. 3. **indifference**: this label is on a green circle centered more in the middle of the diagram, indicating neutral or balanced sectors where the impact of a factor is neither positive nor negative. 4. **critical areas of improvement**: this label is on dark grey circles in the lower-middle and upper-middle quadrants, signifying critical factors that an entity needs to address to enhance its performance. the overlapping nature of these circles creates various regions at their intersections, each signifying a different combination of the aforementioned attributes: the central region where all circles intersect likely signifies the core where all aspects are neutral. the areas where circles overlap slightly on the middle rows and columns could indicate mixed or moderate factors. regions where certain circles dominate over others can infer dominant strengths or significant areas of concern. the intersecting points among the circles provide a visual representation of where multiple factors converge, thereby creating areas of complexity or opportunity for deeper analysis. the model effectively maps out key strategic areas and points of focus to help identify where strengths, weak points, and opportunities lie within a given context.", "type": "Document"}}
