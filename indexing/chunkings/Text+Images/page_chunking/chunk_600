different factors looks to be on par with the overall situation (only a lower weight for the compatibility), other companies show a different breakdown. this is the case of amann girrbach, where the product quality and the management costs show a higher than average weights. zirkonzahn and 3m show a very high weight of product quality, while then overall satisfaction of sirona, dentsply and dental wings look to be mostly affected by the factor support and assistance. multiple regression analysis the regression analysis is a multi-variate statistical technique whose main aim is to find out the existing relationship between a target variable (dependent variable, in our case, the overall satisfaction) and a group of independent variables (each single factor derived from the factor analysis). one of the main focus of the multiple regression is to assess how much part of the dependent variable (satisfaction) is explained by the independent variables (corner stone factors of the satisfaction which have been previously indicated: product quality, support and assistance, management costs, compatibility), i.e. how much these factors are influencing the behavior of the dependent one. the image contains a donut chart representing customer satisfaction for multiple factors as part of a multiple regression analysis of several companies. the chart visually breaks down satisfaction percentages for product quality, support and assistance, management costs, and compatibility. the donut chart consists of four segments, each in different colors and labeled with a percentage value and a factor: **dark red: 18% (product quality)**: indicating the lowest satisfaction score for product quality among the factors listed. **yellow: 17% (support and assistance)**: slightly higher than product quality but below support and assistance. **dark blue: 32% (management costs)**: indicating the highest satisfaction with management costs and the primary concern, as it comprises more than one-third of the overall satisfaction score. **green: 33% (compatibility)**: similarly representing the most balanced and effective factor, shown just above management costs. overall, while the chart clearly outlines the impact of these varied customer satisfaction factors, the primary concern (management costs 32%) stands out significantly compared to others. this aligns with the text in the first image which delves into the regression analysis, emphasizing the correlation and impact of factors such as these on customer satisfaction. the image contains a bar graph which depicts the breakdown of customer satisfaction factors by company. each bar represents a different company with colors indicating various factors that contribute to customer satisfaction. the companies listed in the graph are as follows: 3shape, amann girsbach, sirona, dentsply, zirkonzahn, dental wings, and 3m. each company's satisfaction levels are differentiated into four categories: product quality, support and assistance, management costs, and compatibility, depicted in red, green, blue, and yellow bars respectively. *3shape**: product quality: 21% support and assistance: 32% management costs: 33% compatibility: 18% *amann girsbach**: product quality: 25% support and assistance: 26% management costs: 39% compatibility: 10% *sirona**: product quality: 37% support and assistance: 30% management costs: 22% compatibility: 11% *dentsply**: product quality: 38% support and assistance: 26% management costs: 19% compatibility: 17% *zirkonzahn**: product quality: 22% support and assistance: 45% management costs: 18% compatibility: 14% *dental wings**: product quality: 29% support and assistance: 35% management costs: 17% compatibility: 19% *3m**: product quality: 29% support and assistance: 42% management costs: 21% compatibility: 8% each bar graph's height reflects the relative weight each factor has on the customer's overall satisfaction. for instance, amann girsbach shows the highest weight toward management costs, indicating this is the most significant factor for their customers. conversely, zirkonzahn has higher emphasis on support and assistance, while compatibility is less significant. the graphs show that while some companies (3m, dental wings) place significant weight on support and assistance and management costs respectively, there is no universally dominant factor across all companies, suggesting varied satisfaction needs across the industry.", "type": "Document"}}
