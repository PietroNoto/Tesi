'dont know / no answer' categories suggest potential market gaps or reluctance in respondents. ### contextual integration from image-1: image-1 provides a broader context. the combined numeric data across multiple variables (intra-oral scanners to take digital impressions, chairside milling units only, and chairside milling units including scanners) aligns to show that digital technology adoption in clinics is extensive, with dentsply sirona clearly leading in almost all metrics. the inclusion of charts like image-2 is typical in market analyses to visually represent data distributions, helping stakeholders understand which brands are most popular and in what categories, facilitating strategic decisions on new acquisitions or upgrades within clinics. the image contains a bar chart focusing on scanning equipment usage across three specific contexts: intra-oral scanners taking digital impressions, chairside milling units, and chairside milling units including scanners. the bar chart shows data distribution among various brands of technology and scanning equipment. specifically: 1. **intra-oral scanners to take digital impressions:** - the chart includes a total of 36 cases (intra-oral scanner owners). - the primary brand mentioned is dentsply sirona, indicated by the most extended blue bar. - other notable brands, which also have bars but considerably shorter, include carestream and 3m. - a few instances indicate no answer or other unspecified categories. 2. **chairside milling units only:** - this segment includes only 13 cases (chairside milling unit owners). - dentsply sirona also stands out here, with a long blue bar, followed by a short bar representing other unspecified brands. 3. **chairside milling units including scanners:** - this is based on 36 cases (digital technologies owners). - dentsply sirona again dominates, with the longest bar. other brands like carestream and 3m have shorter but relevant sections. - categories labeled \"other\" show a minimal amount of data compared to the others. the second image highlights the relative prominence of dentsply sirona in terms of intra-oral scanners taking digital impressions, chairside milling units, and chairside milling units with scanners. the bars visually emphasize the brands leading position and relative dominance in the market segment, while smaller bars imply lower usage or preference for other brands. this comparative analysis provides a succinct visualization of market leadership and preference trends among specialized dental scanning and milling unit owners. the image contains a bar graph that represents the numerical distribution of brand rankings for digital technologies within the medical equipment sector focusing on intra-oral scanners and chairside milling units. the graph is derived from a dataset that is shown in the upper portion of the page, titled \"digital technologies: equipment numeric distribution - ranking.\" the bar graph is divided into three horizontal sections, with each section representing different data categories: 1. **intra-oral scanners to take digital impressions (base: 36 cases)**: - this section displays the ranking of brands based on the use of intra-oral scanners for taking digital impressions in a sample of 36 cases. - the brands listed are: - **dentsply sirona** - **carestream** - **3shape** - **3m** - **ios technologies** - **dentsply sirona** and **carestream** are represented with the longest bars, indicating that these brands hold the highest ranks in this category. - the bars for **3shape** and **3m** are slightly shorter, and the bar for **ios technologies** is the shortest, signifying a lower ranking within this specific subset of equipment. 2. **chairside milling units only (base: 13 cases)**: - this part of the graph shows the ordering of chairside milling unit brands from the same group of 13 cases but exclusively focusing on these items. - the only name listed is: - **dentsply sirona** - **dentsply sirona** has a significantly long bar, indicating that it is the highest-ranked in this category, suggesting dominance in the use of these units specifically. 3. **chairside milling units including scanners (base: 36 cases)**: - this last section combines the data for chairside milling units with a broader context that includes intra-oral scanners. - once more, **dentsply sirona** holds the first rank with a long bar, followed by: - **carestream** - **3shape** - **3m** - **ios technologies** - this section provides a comprehensive view that integrates the use of both scanning and milling units within the same brand ranking context. below the bar graph, there is a legend indicating that the absence or very short bar for **ios technologies** represents the \"don't know / no answer\" category, meaning there was no data or an indication on their rank. at the bottom of the page, there are logos for **omnivision digital** and **keystone,** which could possibly represent the source or sponsor of the study/graph. it's marked as \"77,\" which may suggest the page number in the document. in conclusion, the overall message of the bar graph is to provide a visual ranking of digital technologies within the medical equipment sector specific to intra-oral scanners and chairside milling units, with a clear indication of leadership by **dentsply sirona** across the categories represented in the graph.", "type": "Document"}}
