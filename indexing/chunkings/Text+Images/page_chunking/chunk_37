38 appendix: production dental laboratories chart indirect digital restorations production (calculation from number of restorations) - europe the overall production of digital indirect restorations showed a higher than average performance from germany, followed by the uk, which, although is the country with the lowest percentage of digital technologies users among the investigated countries, highlighted a rather high production among the users of this technology (given the low number of cases, this information should be taken as an indication only). the lowest production comes from italy. chart indirect digital restorations production breakdown by material (calculation from number of restorations) - europe the image contains two main sections: the left side shows a detailed report with pie charts and bar graphs, and the right side displays a larger pie chart and smaller bar graphs representing indirect digital restorations production in europe by country. upon close examination, the left section of the image provides detailed statistics under the title \"appendix: production dental laboratories.\" this section includes sections labeled \"chart 43\" and \"chart 44.\" both charts seem to analyze the production of indirect digital restorations in europe in aggregate form and by specific materials. here is a breakdown of the content contained within: *chart 43:** title: \"indirect digital restorations production (calculation from number of restorations) europe\" a pie chart is shown, indicating \"indirect digital restorations overall mean: 73,6.\" other descriptive elements are present, with a reference to \"milled in house,\" \"scans sent for milling to partner lab/milling center,\" and \"plaster models sent for milling to partner lab/milling center.\" a bar graph below the pie chart provides specific numbers: - germany (de): 222 cases, with 5%, 33%, 52%, and 10% represented respectively. - france (fr): 46 cases, with 9%, 41%, and 50% represented. - italy (it): 65 cases, with 9%, 29%, 51%, and 11%. - spain (sp): 26 cases, with 16%, 55%, 21%, and 8%. - uk (u): 11 cases, with 63%, 37%, and 0%. *chart 44:** this section examines the breakdown by material for indirect digital restorations in europe (calculation from number of restorations). it includes another pie chart with accompanying bar graphs. a legend specifies the materials and their respective colors: - cocr (cobalt-chromium): red - ziro2 zirconium: teal - monolithics: darker teal - pmma (polymethyl methacrylate): light green - lithium disilicate: green - other esthetic materials: light blue - wax: dark green bar graphs beside each pie chart detail the specific figures: - de: 0%, 9%, 41%, 50%. - fr: 5%, 7%, 38%, 18%. - it: 5%, 7%, 18%, 10%. - sp: 5%, 5%, 23%, 67%. - u: 0%, 63%, 37%, 0%. the right section repeats much of the left's data but in a larger format and without the detailed materials breakdown of chart it also includes two columns titled \"country\" and \"mean cases,\" with values like 222, 46, 65, 26, and the image overall illustrates a comprehensive analysis of indirect digital restorations in european dental laboratories, with detailed production metrics and breakdowns by country and material. it serves as an insightful reference for understanding the production trends and preferences in this advanced dental technology domain. the image contains the visual representation of indrect digital restorations production, specifically detailing various materials used in these restorations across five different countries. the first image is a pie chart and a bar chart detailing overall indirect digital restorations and their categorization by material in europe, with data provided in cases. the second image (visual representation in the first image) illustrates the material breakdown of indirect digital restorations for five different countries. each country's data is segmented into six segments using varied shades of green, representing different materials. the segments show the percentage distribution of materials used in these restorations: 1. **germany (de)**: - titanium: 53% (light green) - lithium disilicate: 33% (dark green) - monolithic zirconia: 5% (lighter green) - cocr coby-chrome: 3% (brown) - pmma acrylic: 1% (light brown) - zro2 zirconia: 0% (highest shade of green) 2. **denmark (dn)**: - titanium: 32% (light green) - lithium disilicate: 38% (dark green) - monolithic zirconia: 5% (lighter green) - cocr coby-chrome: 5% (brown) - pmma acrylic: 2% (light brown) - zro2 zirconia: 1% (highest shade of green) 3. **italy (it)**: - titanium: 48% (light green) - lithium disilicate: 5% (dark green) - monolithic zirconia: 18% (lighter green) - cocr coby-chrome: 2% (brown) - pmma acrylic: 2% (light brown) - zro2 zirconia: 0% (highest shade of green) 4. **spain (sp)**: - titanium: 53% (light green) - lithium disilicate: 3% (dark green) - monolithic zirconia: 10% (lighter green) - cocr coby-chrome: 10% (brown) - pmma acrylic: 2% (light brown) - zro2 zirconia: 0% (highest shade of green) 5. **united kingdom (uk)**: - titanium: 34% (light green) - lithium disilicate: 23% (dark green) - monolithic zirconia: 5% (lighter green) - zro2 zirconia: 19% (darkest green) - cocr coby-chrome: 3% (brown) - pmma acrylic: 1% (light brown) the chart also includes a bar height for each material indicating its percentage in each country. the distribution and color coding enable a clear comparison of material choices among different countries.", "type": "Document"}}
