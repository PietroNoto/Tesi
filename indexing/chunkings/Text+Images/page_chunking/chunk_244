following attributes? 35 high reputation historical/traditional scientific excellent/the best base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) the image contains a bar chart titled \"attribute associations\" from \"key-stone\". it is a visual representation of a survey result asking respondents to attribute repute to various company brands. the survey measures respondents' perceptions on four different attributes, and for each attribute, the image displays a horizontal bar graph. the attributes measured are: high reputation with the top two bars indicating \"dentsply sirona\" and \"3m\" both at 17% historical/traditional again with \"dentsply sirona\" at 15% and \"3m\" closely following at 16% scientific \"dentsply sirona\" is at 16% and \"ivoclar\" is at 8% excellent/the best with \"dentsply sirona\" at 17% and \"gc\" at 8% each bar represents the percentage of respondents who associate the listed company brand with the respective attribute. the bars are color-coded in light blue and gray. light blue indicates the percentage of respondents, while gray represents the \"other\" category and \"don't know / no answer.\" the respondents ranked \"dentsply sirona\" and \"3m\" as the top companies for high reputation and historical/traditional reputation. for scientific and excellent attributes, \"dentsply sirona\" was again prominent but slightly different companies (like \"ivoclar\" and \"gc\") were also recognized for scientific and excellent categories respectively. the bottom of each graph includes a legend explaining the color codes used, and on the right side, a note indicates the base used for the sample, stating \"base: 1,018 cases (whole sample)\". overall, the chart clearly indicates where these named brands (dentsply sirona, 3m, ivoclar, kavo, straumann, gc, kerr, nobel biocare, kuraray noritake, kulzer, coltene, komet, ultradent) rank within respondents perceptions across these four attributes. the visual comparison across the four categories provides valuable insights into public perception and market positioning among professionals in likely dental-related industry. the image contains a horizontal bar chart. the chart is part of a page that presents the results of a survey about brand awareness and perceptions of various companies related to four different attributes: high reputation, historical/traditional, scientific, and excellent/the best. on the horizontal axis are the names of the companies, categorized in a descending order of their market shares or recognition based on the specified attributes. the vertical axis, however, does not display numerical values but rather provides a visual representation of the proportions, with longer bars indicating a higher proportion of responses. some of the most significant findings are: **3m:** the company 3m has the strongest representation in all four categories, with 16% for high reputation, 16% for historical/traditional, 18% for scientific, and 17% for excellent/the best. **dentsply sirona:** it holds the second-highest proportion in high reputation and excellent/the best categories, at 17% and 14% respectively, while trailing behind slightly in the other two with 15% and 16% respectively. **kavo:** it has notable representations in both historical/traditional (8%) and scientific (14%). **ivoclar and kulzer:** they appear mid-range with percentages around the low to mid teens for most of the categories. **coltene/septodont:** these brands are also in the mid-range group and share similar patterns with other names like strumann, nobel biocare, henry schein, etc. **komet and ultracent:** they are in the lower end, indicated by shorter bars, particularly in higher reputation and high reputation. **other:** an overarching 20% is marked for companies which are either \"other,\" indicating a significant portion of respondents were unfamiliar with or uncertain about the specific brands listed. additionally, a small section in the bottom left marks 'don't know' with 5% signifying respondents who were unsure or couldn't answer specific questions about the brands. the contextual placement of the bar chart in the first image, a broader brand analysis page, helps to give the exact statistical viewpoint from the survey data, showcasing brand trust and recognition across four key attributes. the image contains a bar graph titled \"attribute associations, among all company brands that you know.\" this graph is part of a larger infographic which provides a comparative analysis of consumer perceptions regarding different attributes associated with pharmaceutical brands. the specific bar graph is focused on the attribute 'scientific', showing various responses to the question of which brand is the closest to this attribute. the bar graph includes 11 distinct company brands or product categories as listed below: 1. **3m**: 18% 2. **dentsply sirona**: 16% 3. **ivocar**: 8% 4. **straumann**: 5% 5. **gc**: 5% 6. **kerr**: 3% 7. **nobel biocare**: 3% 8. **kulzer**: 3% 9. **kuraray noritake**: 2% 10. **septodont**: 2% 11. **voco**: 2% 12. **ultradent**: 1% 13. **other**: 27% the 'other' category has a large percentage, indicating variability in responses or unclassifier brands that do not fit into the other specified categories. there are also additional responses indicating that: 6% of respondents do not know or provide no answer. this bar graph is visually represented with horizontal bars, where the height of each bar corresponds to the percentage of respondents who associate each brand with the 'scientific' attribute. the specific lengths of each bar clearly communicate the differences in perceived scientific association among the various brands. for example, 3m is prominently shown as the brand most closely associated with the scientific attribute, followed by dentsply sirona, ivocar, and straumann, whereas brands like kerr, nobel biocare, kulzer, kuraray noritake, and voco are less associated with the scientific attribute. the 'other' category is highlighted by a notably larger gray bar which suggests a strong grouping of responses that do not fit the classified attributes, reflecting a high degree of complexity and variety in brand associations according to this study. the image contains a bar chart from the **attribute associations** section. it compares how respondents associate different pharmaceutical companies with various attributes across a sample of 1018 cases. the attributes include \"high reputation,\" \"historical/traditional,\" \"scientific,\" and \"excellent/the best.\" for the attribute \"excellent/the best,\" the top selections are: **3m** with 17% of respondents associating them with this attribute. **dentsply sirona** with 14%. **gc** at 8%. the distribution is relatively low for most other companies, with responses of 4% or less. specifically, these companies include: **ivoclar** at 7%. **kavo** and **straumann** are tied at 4%. **kerr** is at 2%. other companies like **kulzer**, **coltene**, **nobel biotec**, **kuraray noritake**, **tokuyama**, and **voco**, among others, are at 2% or fewer. for the category labeled \"don't know / no answer,\" 6% of respondents provide this response. the majority of respondents, representing 20%, select \"other\" as the chosen attribute. the remaining percentage is equally split among the listed pharmaceutical companies. overall, the image portrays a comprehensive insight into how pharmaceuticals are perceived differently by respondents associated with these quality attributes, showing clear trends and outliers within the sample population.", "type": "Document"}}
