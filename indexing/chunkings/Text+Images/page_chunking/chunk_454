technicians role will change with the new digital technologies? base: 588 cases (whole sample) the perception about the evolution of the role of dentists and technicians changed as well, in comparison to year its interesting to note a higher percentage of quotes related to the need of cooperation between dentists and technicians, and this statement is true especially for the respondents providing digital prostheses already. among full outsourcing users, the percentage of those stating that there will be no change is remarkably higher. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. 25 2015: 76 cases the image contains a segment of a page that is part of a report or study on the role of dentists and technicians in the future, specifically focusing on the impact of digital technologies. the highlighted section of the first image, marked as number 25, presents a section with three text entries that summarize and expand upon the conclusions drawn from a survey or study regarding how dentists and technicians perceive their roles in the digital era. **first entry (light blue background):** - **content description:** \"the dentists will need to get more expertise about prosthetics, because they will be required to perform part of the work in charge of technicians.\" - **implication:** this suggests a trend towards greater involvement of dentists in practical prosthetic tasks, which were previously more commonly performed by technicians. **second entry (light blue background):** - **content description:** \"there will be an increase in the cooperation between dentists and technicians because the knowledge of the technician in prosthetics materials, aesthetics, and digital processing are important.\" - **implication:** this highlights an increased emphasis on collaborative work, given that both dentists and technicians bring complementary skills. technicians are seen as crucial in terms of material expertise, esthetics, and digital processing, indicating a significant partnership between both professions. **third entry (light blue background):** - **content description:** \"there will not be any change at all, because everyone will always have its own distinct role.\" - **implication:** this viewpoint suggests a traditional stance that holds that both dentists and technicians have and will continue to have clearly defined, distinct roles that do not fundamentally change due to technology. each individual will stick to their own specialized role without altering the inherent boundaries between their responsibilities. these entries draw attention to how different stakeholders perceive the impact of digital advancements on their professional roles and interactions, showcasing a spectrum from evolving competencies to maintaining longstanding distinctions in expertise. the image contains a pie chart that is a graphical representation derived from data presented on the page. the primary pie chart is located in the center of the page, illustrating the data proportions in a circular format, divided into three segments. each segment is marked with a percentage indicating the portion it occupies of the whole. the largest segment occupies 50%, the next segment is 29%, and the smallest segment is 21%. the color scheme of the pie chart consists of three distinct shades: blue for the largest segment, a lighter shade of blue for the medium segment, and a darker shade of blue for the smallest segment. the background beneath the pie chart is white, ensuring that the pie chart stands out clearly. to the right side of the pie chart is bar chart data for the year 2015 with corresponding percentages for each categorized element. each bar of the bar chart represents a different element from left to right, they are represented as follows: in the 'in-house milling' category: 50% in the 'full outsourcing' category: 45% in the 'technology' category: 40% in the 'digital restorations provider' category: 35% in the 'partner-lab' category: 30% and, in the 'manufacturer' category: 15% the right side of the image is separated by a margin from the rest of the page content, ensuring clarity and focus on both charts. the overall visual presentation is clean, with labels and percentages accurately positioned for easy interpretation and comparison. the image contains a bar graph segmented into five categories: \"digital restorations provider,\" \"in-house milling,\" \"scanner,\" \"full outsourcing,\" and \"manufacturer.\" each category is represented by two bars one blue and one dark shade, typically indicating 'no' and 'yes' responses respectively. for \"digital restorations provider\": 56% blue ('yes') 20% dark shade ('no') for \"in-house milling\": 41% blue ('yes') 36% dark shade ('no') for \"scanner\": 54% blue ('yes') 18% dark shade ('no') for \"outsourcing\": 54% blue ('yes') 23% dark shade ('no') for \"manufacturer\": 53% blue ('yes') 21% dark shade ('no') additionally, the image includes an inset chart on the upper left, comparing data from different years, labeled \"2015: 76 cases,\" indicating various statistical categories. the insets contain percentages for 'the dentists will need to get more expertise about prosthetics, because they will be required to perform part of the work in charge of technicians' and 'there will be an increase in the cooperation between dentists and technicians,' among others. a disclaimer states that 2% differences should be considered not statistically relevant. another section comments on the percentage of respondents providing digital prostheses already, noting that among full outsourcing users, those saying there will be no change are the highest. the image contains a graphical representation, which is a pie chart shown in the first image above the second one. this pie chart is divided into three segments with percentages and colors representing distinct options related to the perception of the evolution of dentists' and technicians' roles in the future, specifically in the context of digital technologies. the largest segment, in light blue, represents 37%, followed by the dark blue segment at 35%, and the smallest segment in royal blue comprising 28%. each segment is labeled with its respective percentage, reflecting the respondents' opinions with respect to how they believe the roles will change, the cooperation between dentists and technicians, and the perceived impact of digital technologies in the field. the light blue segment, with the second largest percentage at 37%, suggests that 37% of respondents believe there will be an increase in this cooperation between dental technicians and dentists. the primary contributing factors mentioned are knowledge on digital processing and digital prosthetics materials, esthetics, and digital processing, as indicated by the key in the first image. the dark blue segment, accounting for 35% of the responses, indicates that 35% of the respondents believe that dentists will need to increase their expertise in prosthodontics, which implies they will become more directly involved in the performance of the work that was previously in the charge of technicians for the benefit of providing complete outsourcing users. finally, the smallest segment in royal blue, which constitutes 28% of the responses, reflects the perception that there will be no change at all regarding the collaborative dynamics between dentists and technical professionals because everyone will maintain their distinct role. by observing these segments, it is apparent that the majority of respondents acknowledge that digital technologies will bring about a significant change in how dental professionals collaborate, particularly in the areas of knowledge and skills required for digital prosthodontic practices and the interdisciplinary roles dentists and technicians are likely to transition into.", "type": "Document"}}
