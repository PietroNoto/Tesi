clara are perceived as \"very affordable\" by 5%. a total of 11% of respondents do not know or do not answer. the color-coded bars and precise percentages denote individual respondents opinions on the

diverse, with significant segments considering specific brands as either high-priced or affordable, thus highlighting varying consumer sentiments on financial factors in the dental industry. the image contains a bar diagram that visually represents a survey's data on participants' perceptions of various dentistry brands in terms of price positioning and quality. the bar diagram is titled \"price positioning\" and includes two sections: \"price positioning\" and \"ideal quality-price ratio.\" ### price positioning in the \"price positioning\" section, the horizontal bar chart is divided into four categories: 1. **good but expensive** 2. **too expensive** 3. **very affordable** 4. **unanswerable (represented by a small gray bar)** each column corresponding to a brand's name (such as dentsply sirrana, 3m, ivoclar, etc.) is filled with colored blocks proportional to the responses received. the blocks are color-coded within each brand, and each color corresponds to one percentile of respondents who expressed that viewpoint. #### good but expensive: **dentsply sirrana**: 17% **3m**: 17% **ivoclar**: 7% **gc**: 6% **straumann**: 6% **kavo**: 5% **kulzer**: 3% **kuraray noritake**:

**coltene**: 2% **kuraray noritake**: 2% **ultradent**: 2% *3m* and *dentsply sirrana* are viewed as fairly affordable, with 7% and 6% respectively. #### unanswered: the small gray bar represents the 4% of respondents who did not know or did not answer the question about the price positioning. ### ideal quality-price ratio the \"ideal quality-price ratio\" portion further analyzes respondents' perceptions of brand quality against price. **dentsply sirrana**: 9% **3m**: 10% **ivoclar**: 9% **gc**: 8% *kerr*, *kulzer*, *voco*, and *coltene* receive 2% each. *kuraray noritake*, *ultradent*, and *henry schein* are also present but with lower percentages. *other* brands receive a significant 41% representation, potentially indicating dissatisfaction regarding the quality-price balance for these groups of products. 5% represent that they don't know or didn't answer. ### conclusion in summary, the bar chart in the second image showcases a comprehensive survey of dental materials market perceptions, emphasizing specific brands in terms of price positioning and perceived quality. the highest percentage values are concentrated in *dentsply sirrana* and *3m* for both perception
