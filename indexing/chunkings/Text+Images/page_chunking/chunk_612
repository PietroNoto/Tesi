new digital technologies will affect the way the prosthetics is carried out in your country? dental practices laboratories clinic + labo the belief that digital technologies can totally replace analog ones is 73% for those who already supply digital prosthesis, compared to 44% of those who are still reluctant. for laboratories, the awareness of the total replacement of the traditional prosthesis with the digital one is much more widespread: 68% of those who already provide it and 56% of those who dont. 22 the image contains two bar charts arranged side by side, each depicting data for the years 2015 and 2018 respectively, with a categorical breakdown of responses into three segments. each bar chart has two main segments of different colors, one darker blue and one lighter blue, and a matching text label for each segment on the left side. each chart displays statistics related to perceptions of digital technologies' impact on the way prosthetics are carried out across different entities. the x-axis of both charts ranges from the year 2015 to the y-axis shows percentages, with notable percentage values prominently displayed against the blue background of the bars. the data in the charts are represented with three stacked bars on each chart, each corresponding to different perceptions. the colors of the segments and text labels help distinguish the categories and provide clarity in understanding the survey results. each chart corresponds to a specific category mentioned at the top. the left chart details perceptions related to \"dental practices,\" while the right chart pertains to \"laboratories.\" each chart outlines three major perceptions: a perception suggesting digital technologies will not play a significant role. the belief that these technologies will play an important role, but traditional methods will continue to be used. the belief that digital technologies will replace most traditional methods. the blue and grey segments correspond to different responses with specific color-coded areas detailing different perceptions of the adoption and impact of digital technologies in dental practice and laboratories over the years 2015 and this segmenting provides a visual representation of shifts in perception and highlights trends and opinions in the field of prosthetics across these two distinct sectors. moreover, both the images provide a text box at the top left, presenting survey questions and categorized options, and another text box just around the bar charts comparing the two data sets yearwise. overall, the image effectively conveys specific data regarding the adoption of digital technologies in the field of prosthetics, highlighting changes in perceptions from 2015 to 2018 across dental practices and laboratories. the image contains a bar graph comparing the views on digital technologies in dentistry and laboratories in 2015 and on the left side of the image, the bar graph is titled \"dental practices\". for the year 2015, 43% feel that digital technologies will not play an important role on dentistry because digital technologies are expected to affect a limited part of the profession. 51% believe digital technologies will play an important role but that the traditional practice will continue to be relevant in the future. 7% believe that digital technologies will mostly replace the traditional dental practices. on the right side of the image, the bar graph is titled \"laboratories\". for the year 2015, 46% feel that digital technologies will not play an important role on laboratories because the awareness of the impact is limited. 48% are aware that digital technologies will play an important role, though traditional laboratories will still be relevant. 6% feel that digital technologies will replace most of the traditional laboratories. the second section below the graphs indicates that by 2018, there has been greater belief in the impact and replacement of traditional practices by digital technologies. the image illustrates that the awareness of digital technologies being more integral to each field has increased significantly. for laboratories, 34% believe digital technologies will play an important role but traditional practices will continue to be relevant. additionally, 64% believe that digital technologies will replace most of the traditional laboratories, representing a stark increase compared to for dentistry, 63% of practitioners believe digital technologies will play a significant role but that traditional practices will remain important, compared to 51% in further, 34% feel that digital technologies will replace most of the traditional dental practices by 2018, similar to the increase observed in laboratories. to summarize, the image showcases a progressive shift in perception towards the implementation and impact of digital technologies within dental practices and laboratories from 2015 to there's a visible increased awareness and acceptance of digital technologies across both sectors, with greater anticipation of technological replacement and integration. the second image portrays a comparison of survey responses between dental practices and laboratories regarding the potential roles digital technologies will play in the future of prosthetics. specifically, the second image textualizes the findings of the 2018 survey responses from clinical and laboratory professionals, providing insight into their perceptions of the future implications of digital technologies in the field. the top part of the second image lists different responses to a question about the role digital technologies will play in the future of prosthetics: respondents are categorized by industry (dental practices vs. laboratories) and timeframe (y.2015 vs. y.2018). each category has three distinct responses: 1. \"they will not play an important role because digital technologies will affect a limited part of the prosthetics\" (represented in blue). 2. \"they will play an important role but i feel the traditional prosthetics will continue to be relevant in the future\" (represented in light blue). 3. \"digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics\" (represented in white). from the data provided: in y.2015, dental practices had the following response distributions: - they will not play an important role: 43% - they will play an important role but traditional will be relevant: 34% - digital will replace: 63% in y.2018, dental practices had the following response distributions: - they will not play an important role: 42% (decrease from y.2015) - they will play an important role but traditional will be relevant: 54% (increase from y.2015) - digital will replace: 16% (decrease from y.2015) in y.2015, laboratories had the response distributions: - they will not play an important role: 34% - they will play an important role but traditional will be relevant: 56% - digital will replace: 32% in y.2018, laboratories had the response distributions: - they will not play an important role: 34% (stays the same as y.2015) - they will play an important role but traditional will be relevant: 41% (decrease from y.2015) - digital will replace: 60% (increase compared to y.2015) the image also includes a note clarifying that digital technologies are seen as supplementary to traditional methods in clinical settings, whereas they are predicted to have a more significant impact in laboratories. specifically, in y.2018, a higher percentage of the responses indicated that digital technologies would replace traditional prostheses in laboratories, whereas this sentiment is more cautious within clinical practice settings.", "type": "Document"}}
