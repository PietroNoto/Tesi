some files go direct to milling centers; some files go direct to aligners companies. full digital workflow penetration is very high: in some countries, as spain and italy, use is still fragmented and probably sporadic. labo base: 594 cases cases 137 114 125 113 105 the second image shows a horizontal bar chart, divided into five segments corresponding to five different european countries (germany, france, italy, spain, and the united kingdom). each segment consists of two adjacent bars displaying different categories of techniques penetration in practicing laboratories. the colors used are a darker shade of green and a lighter shade of green to differentiate between the categories. here's a detailed breakdown of each category within the five countries based on the lighter green bars: 1. **germany:** - darker green bar: 25.9% - lighter green bar: 27.5% 2. **france:** - darker green bar: 27.5% - lighter green bar: 33.8% 3. **italy:** - darker green bar: 17.2% - lighter green bar: 34.7% 4. **spain:** - darker green bar: 12.4% - lighter green bar: 34.3% 5. **uk:** - darker green bar: 29.6% - lighter green bar: 31.1% additionally, the chart includes a percentage breakdown along the bottom, labeled as \"basis: whole sample,\" which represents the entire combined dataset or the whole sample base used for this particular analysis of technique penetration. next to the chart, on the right side, theres a boxed section providing some contextual information and explanations regarding the data presented. specifically, it highlights aspects of digitalization within laboratories and differences in digital workflow penetration across various regions: **prolonged digitalization:** 88% of labs receive scan files. **traditional dominance:** its especially high in spain and lower in the uk. smaller labs (16.9% of full digital workflow) tend to have lower interest in increasing digitized work share through scan files. full digital workflow penetration varies but is generally high, particularly in spain and italy, but often remains fragmented. different techniques are noted for traditional, partial, and full digital workflow, each with its own percentage. it provides a table that aligns these percentages per country, with the top countries significantly higher compared to others. this detailed context and breakdown offer insight into how different european regions approach various techniques within their laboratory practices. the image contains a pie chart that reflects the breakdown of laboratory practices by level of digital workflow penetration in various countries. the pie chart is divided into three sections, each representing a different category: traditional techniques (42.2%): this section is the largest portion of the pie chart, indicating that traditional techniques have the highest usage percentage among the three categories. partial digital workflow (35.3%): this section is slightly smaller than the section for traditional techniques, showing that partial digital workflow is moderately used compared to both traditional techniques and full digital workflow. full digital workflow (22.5%): this section is the smallest part of the pie chart, reflecting that full digital workflow is less penetrated when compared to traditional techniques and partial digital workflow. the legend at the bottom of the pie chart provides colors to match each category: traditional techniques are depicted in a darker shade. partial digital workflow is shown in a lighter shade. full digital workflow is colored in the same lightest shade as the second sector. there are a few other annotations in the image: a text box with bullet points detailing the analysis and context, mentioning that digitalization is very high with 88% of labs receiving scan files. a statement indicating that full digital workflow penetration varies significantly in different countries, with some countries fragmented, while some show a sparser adoption of digital working processes. additional notes on lab penetration, digital workflow declaration, and different penetration rates for varying techniques. based on this, it can be inferred that the pie chart is illustrating the usage patterns of different techniques in laboratories, primarily distinguished by levels of digital workflow, indicating a nuanced adoption rate across various countries and regions.", "type": "Document"}}
