with your milling unit? the numeric distribution is the percentage of clients that mentioned to use a certain brand, or to get delivered by a certain supplier. thats why it is comparable with the coverage index, it is a subjective value, related to the brand or supplier which is named by the clients as their brand or their supplier. open technologies has certainly increased its presence among the italian dental labs, and dental wings improved its position too. total scanners (275 cases) scanner only (no milling unit) (198 cases) 89 labo the image contains a bar chart titled \"scanners: numeric distribution\" from a presentation slide. the chart displays the brand percentage of scanners used by a certain population in two distinct categories: \"total scanners 275 cases\" and \"scanner only (no milling unit) 198 cases,\" both presented in percentages. on the left, the bar chart for \"total scanners\" lists the total percentage of various scanner brands from the sample population: **open technologies**: 15% **3shape**: 12% **dental wings**: 10% **dentsploy sirona**: 10% **nobil metal**: 8% **zirkonzahn**: 7% **amanngirrbach**: 6% **egsolution**: 5% **delcam**: 3% **medit**: 2% **kulzer**: 2% **sweden & martina**: 2% **nobel biocare**: 2% **8853 / 8dent**: 2% **roland**: 2% **kavo**: 2% **abacus**: 2% **other**: 11% **don't know / no answer**: 2% to the right, a similar bar chart for \"scanner only (no milling unit)\" lists different brands but focuses on the subset of survey respondents who do not use the scanners for milling unit purposes: **open technologies**: 17% **3shape**: 11% **dental wings**: 9% **dentsploy sirona**: 9% **nobil metal**: 7% **amanngirrbach**: 5% **egsolution**: 8% **delcam**: 3% **medit**: 2% **kulzer**: 2% **sweden & martina**: 2% **nobel biocare**: 2% **8853 / 8dent**: 2% **roland**: 2% **kavo**: 2% **abacus**: 2% **other**: 13% **don't know / no answer**: 2% the background of the slide includes an excerpt explaining the relevance of the numeric distribution of scanners and their usage with milling units, pointing out brands that seem to have an increased market presence among italian dental labs, specifically mentioning open technologies and dental wings. the image contains a bar chart that visually represents the distribution of scanner brands in two separate settings. the chart labels these as \"total scanners (275 cases)\" and \"scanner only (no milling unit) (198 cases)\". the bars represent the percentage distribution of the number of scanners corresponding to each brand among the total surveyed cases. on the y-axis, there is a percentage range from 1% to 17%, indicating the market share of each scanner brand. the x-axis lists various dental scanners brands including open technologies, 3shape, dental wings, dentsply sirona, nobil metal, zirkonzahn, amangirrbach, egsolution, delcam, medit, kulzer, sweden & martina, nobel biocare, 8853 / 88dent, roland, kavo, abacus, and an unspecified \"other\" category. these brands are categorically segmented based on their presence in the total scans versus just scans without a milling unit. *observations from the image:** 1. **open technologies** holds the largest share of both total scanners at 15% and scanner-only ones at 17%, indicating its dominance in this market segment. 2. **3shape** follows with 12% of total scanners and 11% of scanner-only cases. 3. **dental wings** has 10% of the total scanners and 9% of the scanner-only cases. the percentages for **dentsply sirona**, **nobil metal**, **zirkonzahn**, **amangirrbach**, and **egsolution** are slightly lower, at 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, and 5%, respectively. 5. **delcam** and **medit** occupy 3% and 2% of the total scanners, with no milling unit data provided. 6. **kulzer**, **sweden & martina**, **nobel biocare**, **5583 / 85dent**, and **rolland** each represent a 2% market share in total scanners but don't contribute to scanner-only cases. slightly more unique observations are **abacus** and **other**, each representing 2% of scanners overall and total scanner-only cases, but are marked as having a 13% market share in just scanner-only cases. there is a \"don't know / no answer\" category marked with 1% for both configurations of scanners. *analysis context in the first image:** the accompanying text in the first table elaborates on numeric distribution, emphasizing that it reflects the percentage of clients associating a certain scanner brand with a certain supplier. the text suggests that these brand preferences correlate with the coverage index labeled by the client as \"their\" brand or supplier. highlighted in the first table, open technologies and dental wings have notably increased their presence in italian dental labs, improving their market positioning compared to previous reports. this detailed description provides an understanding of the bar chart visually and contextually within the specified image. the information is precise, ensuring clarity and a thorough examination that aligns with the initial structure and data presentation.", "type": "Document"}}
