this section uses bars to indicate the frequency or number of times each supplier has been used numerically. there is a large variety in the length of these bars, suggesting significant differences in usage among the suppliers. 2. **top used:** - a slightly different representation with bars indicating the percentage of respondents who report using these suppliers. the top supplier, \"proclinic,\" is noted as 26% and 40% (combined top used and top most used), followed by \"casa schmidt\" at 19% and 36%. 3. **pql index:** - the pql index is calculated via the ratio of top used to overall penetration. this metric shows which suppliers are most preferred based on their importance. these values vary from 1 at the base (equal to the top used percentage) to above 1, showing an increased preference. *footnotes and key notes:** the notation about having multiple choice answers allows for a comprehensive understanding of the data. the total summation noted, 237% (excluding \"don't know\" response, indicating that on average, spanish labs use approximately 2-4 different suppliers. pql index further indicates the quality of usage preference over penetration. *detailed breakdown of suppliers:** - **proclinic**: highest numeric (26%) and pql index values. - **casa schmidt**: close behind proclinic numerically and pql index suggesting strong preference. - **casa schmidt:** 19% top user, 36% most important. - notable percentages for other suppliers, including a 7% for cas schmidt and 5% for garzon. - some names like dental 7 and proxdental asturias have only a 1% in top used. *don't know / no answer section:** 13% respond with \"don't know.\" high response (67%) indicating most respondents knew their suppliers. *additional note:** the overall fragmentation is tied to the presence of small local dealers. this detailed breakdown offers a clear, structured representation of the suppliers' popularity and usage in the context of dental dealers, showcasing both primary and preferred suppliers within the industry. the image contains a numerical distribution representation related to the main suppliers used by dental dealers. the second image, which is embedded in the first one, showcases a detailed numerical data distribution concerning the ranking of suppliers based on a specific metric. the image displays a graph with two axes: the vertical y-axis represents the numerical values from 0.64 to 0.50, and the horizontal x-axis shows the positional placements of different suppliers. the graph itself is adorned with a series of vertical dots that signify the magnitude or importance of each supplier, arranged in descending order as they descend the x-axis. starting from the top: 1. **proclinic** and **casa schmidt** both tie for the highest position with a numerical value of 0.64. 2. **garzon** follows with a slightly lesser value of 0.53. 3. **dental everest** and **labo shop** both have a numerical value of 0.39. 4. **dt & shop** follows closely with a value of 0.28. 5. **molto dent** and **dent-thel** both have a numerical value of 0.14. 6. **henry schein**, **linerden**, **dental madrid**, **dentaurum**, **dental 7**, and **proxdental asturias** all share the same value at 0.13. 7. **hiperdental** and **bnb** both share the numerical value of 0.12. following is **garicia torres** with a numerical value of 0.11. 9. **catalana dental** and **kiedentes** both have the value of 0.09. 10. **jucadent** and **juador** are tied with 0.07. the last few suppliers are marked under 'other' and have numerical values between 0 to 0. the graph effectively visualizes the pql (percentage of questions lacking answer) index, which measures the quality of supplier penetration. the presence of strong suppliers indicated by the top points reflects significant customer engagement and response. a key takeaway from this graphical representation is the clear distinction between the leading suppliers that have high customer interaction and the remaining suppliers that show declining values. the sharp drop from the leading suppliers showcases the intensity of engagement with top customers, emphasizing the critical role these suppliers play in the dental supply market. the graphs clarity further indicates that while there is strong market leadership, there is potential for other suppliers to improve their market penetration and customer satisfaction.", "type": "Document"}}
