**88%**: this segment represents the proportion of people who do not have intentions of purchasing both intraoral scanners and chairside milling. - the legend underneath labels these segments: - **intraoral scanner** (depicted in dark blue) - **chairside milling** (depicted in lighter blue) **center (blue area):** - **12%**: this indicates the proportion of respondents who do not have intentions to purchase chairside milling but do have intentions to purchase the intraoral scanner. - this area aligns directly with the segment labeled intraoral scanner, suggesting that these individuals favor intraoral scanning technology but are indifferent or uninterested in chairside milling. given the additional descriptive text on this page: the title and subtitle provide a clear context of the data analysis concerning purchase intentions for these two technologies. the base sample sizes (135 potential clients versus 410 non-owners) provide the context for the data but do not visually impact the diagram. the detailed breakdowns show that the majority of respondents (88%) have no intention to purchase an intraoral scanner nor a chairside milling unit, and a small portion (12%) has the intention to purchase an intraoral scanner but not a chairside milling unit. the rest must be divided between the group with intentions for one or neither type of equipment. the image and context together suggest that there is a significant gap in demand between the two technologies, where intraoral scanners are more popularly considered than chairside milling units among the surveyed audience. the second image, found centrally on the page immediately following the first image, is a detailed graph that provides a precise visualization of purchase intentions for both chairside milling units and intraoral scanners among potential customers, categorized by the willingness to invest in cerec cam technologies as denoted in the first section of the first image. the graph itself is divided into two distinct sets of pie charts: the first pie chart presents the percentage of respondents who confirm their intent to purchase chairside milling units with a specific level of certainty. the second pie chart presents the percentage of respondents who confirm their intent to purchase intraoral scanners with a specific level of certainty. ### intention to purchase chairside milling unit: the chart in the top left quarter of the image is labeled \"certainly + probably,\" indicating the respondents who either \"certainly\" or \"probably\" intend to purchase a chairside milling unit. the chart depicts two distinct segments: the segment for \"certainly\" shows a small portion, indicating about 1% of the respondents. the segment for \"certainly + probably\" shows a larger portion, constituting approximately 5% of the respondents. ### intention to purchase intraoral scanner: the chart in the bottom left quarter of the image is labeled \"certainly i will.\" it depicts the respondents who have confirmed their intent to purchase an intraoral scanner with high certainty. the chart shows a significant portion: about 32% of the respondents fall into this category, marked prominently in darker blue. additionally, the first image provides a clear comparative context: the pie chart in the first image (top left portion) shows the broader base, with two main segments: 88% for the intraoral scanner and 12% for chairside milling units among 135 cases, indicating an overwhelmingly higher percentage of respondents inclined towards purchasing an intraoral scanner. in the corresponding data within the second image (top right portion), in a smaller sample of 40 cases (non-owners), there also shows a significant inclination with 32% (almost the same as the 88% in the first image) towards the intraoral scanner while it just slightly differs for chairside milling unit. this visual presentation not only mirrors the first image's statistical inclinations but emphasizes the disparity in the market intent, supporting the notion that intraoral scanners have a larger influence on purchasing decisions compared to chairside milling units within the sample group highlighted in the second image. the image contains a short graphical representation, specifically displaying a segment of a larger infographic, which is titled \"intention to buy: intraoral scanner vs. chairside milling unit.\" this segment focuses on the overall intention of non-owners, denoted by the label \"basis 410 non owners,\" to engage in the specific purchase behaviors of intraoral scanners and chairside milling units. the segment is highlighted with two bars. the left bar represents the \"overall intention to purchase chairside,\" colored in blue, with a numerical value of 4%. this indicates that out of the 410 non-owners surveyed, a 4% segment manifests an intent to purchase the chairside milling unit. the right bar represents the \"overall intention to purchase scanner,\" depicted in dark blue, with a significantly larger numerical value of 32%. this implies that 32% of the 410 non-owners surveyed declare their intent to purchase an intraoral scanner. comparatively, it can be discerned that there's a notable higher interest in purchasing an intraoral scanner compared to their intention to buy a chairside milling unit among the non-owners segment surveyed.", "type": "Document"}}
