total installed base vs 2020/2021 period. 17 clinic the scatter plot represents the historical evolution of the installed brands base: 264 cases the image contains a vertical bar chart titled \"intraoral scanners brand,\" which represents the market shares of various intraoral scanners by brand in 2020/ the chart is divided into two vertical sets of bars, one for \"total installed\" and one for \"2020/2021.\" in the \"total installed\" section: dentsply sirona leads with 25%. 2. 3shape follows with 20%. itero comes in with 17%. carestream has 12%. medit is slightly behind with 10%. planmeca has a noteworthy 16%. myray is 4%. dental wings and kulzer each have only 2%. in the \"2020/2021\" section: dentsply sirona again has the highest share at 15%, followed by 3shape at 18%, and itero at 23%. on the right side of the chart, a scatter plot visualizes the historical evolution of brands installed in the market, with dentsply sirona, 3shape, and itero marked, showing a generally increasing trend for dentsply sirona and a decrease for 3shape. the scatter plot has a vertical axis representing \"total installed share\" and a horizontal axis with the percentage range from 0% to approximately 25%. in the lower-left corner, it mentions \"base: 264 cases.\" at the bottom of the image, the logos for omnivision digital and key-stone are visible, indicating that they were involved in producing or compiling the study. the image in the second slot shows a bubble scatter plot that visually represents the distribution and evolution of various intraoral scanners' market shares over different installed bases. this plot corresponds to the broader analysis depicted in the first image. here's a detailed description of the content of the second image in the context of the first one: *title and labels:** the image is titled \"intraoral scanners brand.\" the vertical axis is labeled \"2021 installed share.\" the horizontal axis is labeled \"total installed share.\" there are four categories labeled: \"brands that are gaining share in the total installed market\" and \"brands that are losing share in the total installed market.\" the image employs scattered dots connected by diagonal lines to illustrate the growth trend over time. *brands and share trends:** different brands are represented with dots. each dot's position reflects the brand's installed base in 2021's share within the total market share at that time. the first graph shows the share increase of the following brands: itero, 3shape, medit, and dentply sirona. - \"itero\" has a significant share slightly above the top middle section of the plot. - \"3shape\" follows closely behind, positioned just below itero. - \"medit\" is positioned slightly lower from the itero and 3shape brands. - \"dentply sirona\" shows a strong presence in the middle-upper section. the second graph illustrates brands that have seen a decrease in share: planmeca, myray, dental wings, and kulzer. - myray and dental wings are positioned near the bottom-left section. - kulzer lies below them. - planmeca is situated lower still. *graph structure:** the plot uses colored dots to distinguish each brand. diagonal lines connect dots, with colors corresponding to gains or losses. a blue line represents brands gaining market share. a red line represents brands losing share. each line connects the dots from one period (presumably 2020) to the next, showing the trajectory of the brands installed share over time. *text annotations:** the text on each side of the plot clarifies which brands are experiencing gains or losses. there is red text on the right and blue text on the left, indicating these specific trends. *source and context:** the image has a watermark in the bottom-left, \"omnivision digital,\" suggesting the brand or publisher of the data. the bottom-left also references \"total installed share: 264 cases,\" providing further context for the data analysis. in summary, the second image effectively uses a bubble scatter plot to visualize the market share dynamics of intraoral scanners, illustrating which brands have seen share growth and which have experienced declines. the detailed structure and color coding help in easily distinguishing between brands and their corresponding market trends over time.", "type": "Document"}}
