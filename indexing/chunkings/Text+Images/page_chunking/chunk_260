yellow: neutral - dark pink: quite relevant ### key observations: the all brands and 3m brand are compared across these attributes. for most attributes, all brands garner higher relevance scores compared to 3m in both the 'totally relevant' and 'totally irrelevant' categories. there is a notable consistency in the color distribution of relevance scores between the all brands and 3m brand, demonstrating the overall trend in consumer perception. ### conclusion: this image provides a vivid comparison of how consumers from the brand equity clinic and a broader sample rate 3m brand and all brands as follows. the detailed comparison allows brands to assess areas they need to improve and areas of strength. the visual and numerical data effectively capture the nuances of consumer perceptions, which is crucial for brand positioning and marketing strategies. the image contains a structured comparison of the brand image perceptions across various aspects from two perspectives: three million (3m) and the average number of all brands (all brands). the comparison covers eight attributes: high reputation, high quality, long-time tradition, easiest to use, innovating company, customer orientation, friendliness, and quality/price ratio. the comparison is visually represented by stacked bar graphs, where responses are divided into five categories based on their relevance: totally irrelevant, partially irrelevant, neutral, quite relevant, and totally relevant. each category is denoted by a different color: red, orange, yellow, green, and blue respectively. for each attribute, respondents have indicated their levels of agreement with the brand statements, visually separated by data from the three million respondents and the mean data for all brands. for instance: the company's high reputation is considered relevant by 51% of 3m respondents compared to 46% of the overall all brands average. the statement about quality/price ratio shows 30% of 3m respondents rated it as \"very relevant\" while 32% of the overall average agreed on this. regarding customer orientation, 47% of 3m respondents felt this aspect was important, which is comparable to the overall average of 47%. at the bottom, the image includes a figure that likely represents the 3m average values in an infographic style, with color bands indicating the proportion of responses for each category. each stacked bar visually captures the distribution of sentiment across the different brand attributes, providing a comparative overview between the respondents and the overall brand average. the image contains a horizontal bar graph that measures customer perceptions of brand attributes for \"3m\" in comparison to \"all brands.\" the x-axis indicates different brand attributes such as high reputation, high quality, long-time tradition, and others. the left side of the graph is color-coded, and ratings range from \"totally irrelevant\" (red) to \"totally relevant\" (blue). the ratings for both \"3m\" and \"all brands\" are illustrated using colored circles for \"totally irrelevant\" (red), \"partially irrelevant\" (orange), \"neutral\" (yellow), \"quite relevant\" (green), and \"totally relevant\" (blue). for each attribute, it's clearly visible how much percentage of people rated the brand as relevant or not. the numbers inside each circle represent the percentage of respondents with this perception. the second image (the smaller one inside the first image) is a stylized line graph depicting the mean values for the attributes for both \"all brands\" and \"3m.\" each data point is marked clearly with a symbol and has its specific values labeled. these values represent the average responses in respect to each attribute. the data is visualized with line segments that connect each mean value, creating a visual trend across different brand attributes. the y-axis, indicated on the right side of the graph, runs from 3.0 to 4.5 and represents the mean values across many attributes. there appears to be a general declining trend from the 'all brands' mean values to the '3m' mean values across multiple attributes. each data points corresponding value is precise, and connections are made to show a clearer trend. the line graph and the accompanying horizontal bars together provide a comprehensive view of customer perceptions and comparisons.", "type": "Document"}}
