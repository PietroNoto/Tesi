**onlyscanner owner:** - **product quality**: 48% - **customer support services**: 22% - **training**: 12% - **running costs**: 18% - **chairside owner:** - **product quality**: 42% - **customer support services**: 21% - **training**: 21% - **running costs**: 17% ### key points: \"product quality\" consistently plays the largest role in overall satisfaction for both owner groups, though it appears slightly lower for chairside owners at 42% compared to 48% for only scanner owners. the most notable difference lies in the impact of \"training,\" which is a significant weight for only scanner owners (12%) but a comparatively lower 21% for chairside owners. the contribution from \"running costs\" is almost equal between the two categories at 18% for only scanner owners and 17% for chairside owners. ### observational insights: the specific importance of \"product quality\" is underlined by it accounting for nearly half the variation in satisfaction for both owner types. while \"product quality\" remains a common concern, the factors that slightly differ between the groups hint at nuanced market dynamics where specific training benefits may be perceived more by only scanner owners while cost management might be more crucial for chairside owners. by integrating data about these owners' satisfaction variables, the chart aids in understanding which aspects to potentially tailor for improved satisfaction for each group.", "type": "Document"}}
