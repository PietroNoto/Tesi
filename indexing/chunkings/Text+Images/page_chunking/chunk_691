62% 2. **3shape** - 78% 3. **zirkonzahn** - 90% 4. **amann gibrach** - 54% 5. **dental wings** - 64% 6. **dentsply sirona** - 88% 7. **open technologies** - 49% 8. **bego** - 38% 9. **kavo** - 47% 10. **roland** - 57% 11. **ivoclar vivadent** - 49% 12. **formlabs** - 24% the bars are color-coded in shades of blue and dark blue, with the dark blue (lower percentage) at the bottom and the lighter blue (higher percentage) at the top. a legend is provided for reference on the bottom right indicating the color coding: the dark blue bar represents lower digital awareness (up to 2%). the light blue bar represents higher digital awareness, reaching up to 88%. the graph provides insights into how familiar consumers are with these brands in a digital context. notably, brands like **dentsply sirona** and **zirkonzahn** lead significantly with 88% and 90% awareness respectively. the presentation mentions **3m** and **amann gibrach** having lower awareness figures, specifically at 62% and 54% respectively, highlighting notable variances between the brands. additionally, the graph demonstrates how the digital awareness index can help in marketing and brand positioning within the digital dentistry sector. the reference to a relevance index, depicted by a declining red line, provides a visual indicator of the relative relevance of the brands to their audience, which is an essential metric for businesses looking to improve their digital presence and marketing strategies. the image contains a line graph titled as part of a presentation, but only the graph itself is visible without textual labels and descriptions. the graph tracks some metric (presumably the relevance index mentioned in the first image) over a set of horizontal points corresponding to brand names. the individual brands included in the graph are 3shape, zionkonzahn, amann girrbach, dental wings, dentsply sirona, open technologies, bego, kavo, roland, ivoclar vivadent, and formlabs. some of the values plotted for each brand are as follows: 3shape: starts at about 0.28, reaches a peak at 0.42 around the 0.15 mark on the horizontal axis (representing brand names), then falls to about 0.18 before rising slightly. zionkonzahn: starts at approximately 0.04, peaks around 0.1, and then decreases back to about 0. amann girrbach: begins around 0.06, maintains a relatively stable value of 0.06 throughout. dental wings: starts at about 0.05 and remains almost unchanged at around 0. dentsply sirona: starts at about 0.12, reaches a small peak at about 0.18, and then tapers off. open technologies: begins with a value of 0 and stays at 0 throughout the time frame shown. bego: starts at approximately 0.06, remains relatively level around 0.05, with a slight dip towards the end. kavo: begins its trend around 0.10, peaks at 0.13 before leveling off. roland: starts around 0.06 and remains fairly steady. ivoclar vivadent: begins with a value around 0.06, peaks slightly to about 0. formlabs: begins at approximately 0.18 and falls down to 0.15 before rising again slightly. the line graph visually represents the variation in relevance index over time or across different brands, providing insights that may aid in identifying the most recognizable or popular brands in the dental segment.", "type": "Document"}}
