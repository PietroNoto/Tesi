out to you rate in the following areas? please rate them with totally irrelevant, partially irrelevant, neutral, quite relevant, totally relevant. 35 base: 133 quotes 3shape sirona-cerec 3m processing without don't know base: 57 quotes base: 42 quotes the image contains text and visual data presented in two columns. the left column presents data categorized under various attributes of brand positioning: \"3shape,\" \"sirona-cerec,\" and \"3m.\" each attribute has been rated against multiple criteria, represented in three different color-coded scales - not relevant, quite relevant, and totally relevant. additionally, a section in the bottom right corner titled \"processing without 'don't know'\" contains results aggregating data from different sources (133 quotes, 57 quotes, and 42 quotes). each category under the left column has a list of attributes ranked against these relevance scales. for instance, \"recommendable to colleagues\" is followed by a distribution of \"not relevant,\" \"quite relevant,\" and \"totally relevant,\" represented visually through horizontal bar graphs. each bar graph measures the significance of each attribute in terms of relevancy (percentage distribution). the use of colors (teal for not relevant, light blue for quite relevant, and dark blue for totally relevant) helps differentiate between these levels of relevancy visually. the right column depicts a condensed form of this data for 3m, showing specific percentages beneath each attribute. this column is more compact, presenting direct percentages related to the three relevance categories (not relevant, quite relevant, totally relevant). each row in this column reflects the aggregated results for attributes related to 3m, with values ranging from 25% to 50%, providing a concise visual summary of the relevance of brand characteristics to 3m's brand positioning. for example, under \"highly reputed\" for 3m, the breakdown is 25% not relevant, 40% quite relevant, and 35% totally relevant. this visual representation underscores the brand's attributes in a straightforward and easily comparable fashion. each attributes distribution within these three categories enables a comprehensive understanding of each brand's perception across diverse aspects. the image contains a dataset table that displays scores for different brand characteristics across three categorizations: 3shape, sirona-cerec, and 3m. each brand characteristic is rated on a spectrum ranging from \"not relevant\" (denoted by lighter blue) to \"totally relevant\" (denoted by darker blue and red). the ratings reflect the perceived importance of each characteristic as reported by a group of people, with the values showing the percentage of ratings falling into each category. the table is divided into columns representing different characteristics, with the ratings for each characteristic divided into three rows corresponding to the three brand types: 3shape, sirona-cerec, and 3m. the characteristics listed are: recommended to coworkers innovative and at the forefront customer service oriented affordable trustworthy too expensive highly reputable reliable makes daily practice easier good price quality ratio worldwide renowned leading company the ratings within each cell indicate a combination of the percentage of \"not relevant,\" \"quite relevant,\" and \"totally relevant\" responses. for example, if a cell is a deep blue at the bottom, it means \"totally relevant\" accounts for almost the entire score for that particular characteristic. specific ratios provide insight into how the perceived relevance of each characteristic compares among the three brand types. for instance, under \"recommended to coworkers,\" the sirona-cerec brand might have higher relevance compared to 3shape or 3m. similarly, under \"customer service oriented,\" 3m has relatively high relevance rated as totally relevant. these differences indicate that the perception or emphasis of each brand varies significantly concerning these attributes. the image overall provides a detailed comparison of brand perception across three different categories, which can help in understanding brand strengths and target audiences better. the image contains a detailed breakdown of the brand positioning assessment data represented in the form of bar charts associated with various market research methods. specifically, the visual data pertains to brand positioning, with comparisons made between three major data sets: \"3shape,\" \"sirona-cerec,\" and \"3m.\" ### detailed description of the image *title and instructions:** at the top-left corner, the image is titled \"brand positioning.\" below the title, an instruction directs the viewer to rate different aspects of the brands based on their perception, categorizing responses into \"not relevant\" (grey bars), \"quite relevant\" (light blue bars), and \"totally relevant\" (dark blue bars). *data breakdown charts:** *3shape (based on 133 quotes):** each bar under 3shape's context is segmented into three sections reflecting \"not relevant,\" \"quite relevant,\" and \"totally relevant.\" the data is color-coded with not relevant represented in grey, quite relevant represented in light blue, and totally relevant in dark blue. observing the ratings, various percentages represent the level of response for each attribute: **recommendable to colleagues**: the grey bar indicates 14%, light blue 51%, and dark blue 35%, showing a higher overall relevance in the audience's opinion. **innovative and at the forefront**: the dark blue bar is the highest at 42%, indicating strong relevance. *sirona-cerec (based on 57 quotes):** similarly, the sirona-cerec data shows varying relevance percentages across attributes: **recommendable to colleagues**: 14% in grey, 42% in light blue, and 25% in dark blue. **innovative and at the forefront**: again, the dark blue bar peaks at 25%, showing moderate relevance. *3m (based on 42 quotes):** the data for 3m includes: **recommendable to colleagues**: all three sections, which are 14% in grey, 35% in light blue, and 25% in dark blue. **innovative and at the forefront**: the grey bar is 22%, while the light blue and dark blue collectively cover the remaining segments. *notable graph pattern:** each graph illustrates the breakdown per attribute (e.g., affordability, reputation, etc.) in a clear visual format, with grey showing where relevant percentages decline or do not fit the context, light blue where there is perceived relevance, and dark blue indicating the highest relevance. its clear that for 3shape, the \"totally relevant\" section (dark blue) is marked significantly more than other models, showing a higher level of trust and association among the audience in that context. *data source:** the base for each dataset is noted at the bottom left corner: 133 quotes for 3shape, 57 quotes for sirona-cerec, and 42 quotes for 3m. this detailed visualization facilitates a comprehensive understanding of how different brands are perceived, with clear indications of which attributes are more or less relevant to various audiences when positioning within dental or medical markets. ### conclusion: given the specific details in both images, the second image in the context of the first provides deeper insight into the exact relevance breakdown on how various dental companies are perceived. this breakdown is crucial for marketing strategies aiming to target specific brand attributes effectively.", "type": "Document"}}
