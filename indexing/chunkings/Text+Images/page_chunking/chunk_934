**title:** \"digital equipment brands: total awareness vs. relevance map\" - **instructions:** the slide asks a viewer to identify a cad-cam manufacturer from the available options. 2. **legend:** - the legend is on the left-hand side of the image. it includes circular icons of different colors. each color circle represents a brand. the legend lists the following brands: 1. **3m** 2. **kavo** 3. **bego** 4. **3dental wings** 5. **dentsply sirona** 6. **zirkonzahn** 7. **ivoclar vivadent** 8. **roland** 9. **amann girrbach** 10. **formlabs** 11. **open technologies** 12. **3shape** 3. **grid and data points:** - the main body of the image presents a grid that maps the brands on a coordinate system where: - **horizontal axis (x-axis):** represents 'relevance.' - **vertical axis (y-axis):** represents 'total awareness.' - each brand name is connected to a red bubble, indicating the brand's score on these two metrics. the size of the red bubbles appears to correlate with the intensity of the brand's impact or presence in the market but does not provide explicit quantitative values. 4. **brands placed on the map:** - **3m:** located within the higher part of the relevance axis and lower part of the total awareness axis. - **kavo:** also shown but with a slightly different position relative to 3m. - **bego:** situated midway on the axes. - **dental wings:** located lower than 3m and kavo towards the relevance axis. - **dentsply sirona:** positioned near zirkonzahn on the higher total awareness axis. - **zirkonzahn:** located higher on the relevance axis and lower on the total awareness axis. - **ivoclar vivadent:** midway and slightly higher on the total awareness axis. - **roland:** higher on the relevance axis but significantly lower on the total awareness axis. - **amann girrbach:** lower on both axes, towards the lower section on the relevance side. - **formlabs:** midway, slightly lower towards relevance. - **open technologies:** located significantly lower on both axes. - **3shape:** this is the most prominent bubble, situated very high on both axes, indicating a high total awareness and relevance. ### description of the second image included in the first image: the second image is a separate bubble map that showcases different digital equipment brands. specific brands included in this illustration are: 1. **zirkonzahn** 2. **dentsply sirona** 3. **3shape** 4. **ivoclar vivadent** 5. **roland** 6. **amann girrbach** 7. **formlabs** 8. **open technologies** the visualization uses the same color-coded legend as in the first image but is more densely packed with bubbles, suggesting a more comprehensive view or a refined selection of brands. each brand's bubble indicates its performance on the total awareness and relevance. the following observations are notable: **zirkonzahn** and **dentsply sirona** are located near each other, showing similar metrics. **3shape** stands out, with a significant advantage both in terms of total awareness and relevance. **ivoclar vivadent** is positioned midway on the vertical axis showing relatively balanced performance. **roland** indicates lower relevance compared to total awareness. **amann girrbach** appears at the bottom left, suggesting low relevance. **formlabs** shows moderate performance. **open technologies** lies lower both on relevance as well as total awareness. ### interpretation (chain of thought): by examining the data points, one can observe that 3shape dominates the market in terms of high relevance and awareness, which places it in a strong position. **zirkonzahn** and **dentsply sirona** are also competitive with solid metrics. on the other hand, brands like **amann girrbach** and **open technologies** lag behind in terms of relevance and awareness. the clustering of top brands together along the axes suggests that these well-known companies are leaders in their digital landscape. overall, this", "type": "Document"}}
