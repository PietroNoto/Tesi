17 chart use of digital technologies breakdown by channel the manufacturer (or milling center) is the most common channel used to produce digital restorations. the manufacturer/milling center is requested to mill digital restorations by receiving either a traditional plaster model from the laboratory, or a scan file, from laboratories equipped with a scanner. chart use of digital technologies breakdown by channel europe vs. breakdown per country once again, germany and france show higher percentages in the use of the channel manufacturer/milling center while spain shows the highest percentage in the use of a partner lab, together with italy. given the lower number of cases, the results of the uk should be taken as an indication only. the image contains two bar charts labeled as \"chart 17\" and \"chart 18\" from a report by key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - these charts analyze the use of digital technologies in the european market by different channels. in \"chart 17,\" titled \"use of digital technologies breakdown by channel,\" the data is presented in two separate sets. the first set shows the percentage distribution across different channels for receiving scans: \"milled in house\": 34% \"scans sent to partner labs\": 26% \"scans sent to manufacturers / milling centers\": 47% the second set shows the percentage distribution across the same channels for receiving plaster models: \"plaster models sent to partner labs\": 19% \"plaster models sent to manufacturers / milling centers\": 8% \"chart 18,\" titled \"use of digital technologies breakdown by channel europe vs. breakdown per country,\" contains multiple vertical bar charts depicting the percentage use across various in-lab, manufacturer, and partner lab channels for both scans and plaster models. from the categories presented: in-lab milling: 52% of scans and 34% of plaster models. manufacturer: 40% of scans and 52% of plaster models. partner labs: 26% of scans and 40% of plaster models. additionally, there is a sub-category in the uk section, showing different percentages for each channel, but based on the provided text in the first image, the exact values are not distinctly clear due to a cutoff. the image contains a compilation of two bar charts, each detailing the breakdown of channel usage by country for various industries. below is the detailed description of the second image in the context of the first: ### chart breakdown: *title:** use of digital technologies breakdown by channel europe vs. breakdown per country *description:** *chart 17:** **use of digital technologies breakdown by channel:** - the chart is divided into two main sections: a horizontal bar chart with categories representing different channels used for digital technologies. a vertical bar chart indicating the percentage of different countries or regions using these channels for digital technologies. 1. **channels used:** - \"milled in house\" - 34% - \"scans sent to partner labs\" - 26% - \"scans sent to manufacturers/milling centers\" - 47% - \"plaster models sent to partner labs\" - 19% - \"plaster models sent to manufacturers/milling centers\" - 34% 2. **per country usage (vertical bar chart):** - countries/regions represented are: - in-lab miling - manufacturer - partner lab - de - fr - it - sp - uk - *data interpretation:* - **in-lab miling:** - the in-lab miling category has the highest percentage of milled products (52%). - **manufacturer:** - next is the manufacturer's usage, accounting for 40%. - **partner lab:** - 58% of partners labs' digital restorations are milled. - **countries:** - germany and france show significant usage for manufacturing or milling centers. - spain has the highest partner lab usage, reflecting the importance of collaborating partner labs in digital restorations. - the uk exhibits lower usage, indicating lesser dependency or capacity. *chart 18:** **use of digital technologies breakdown by channel europe vs. breakdown per country:** - similar to chart 17 but focused on per country comparisons: 3. **per country usage for: in-lab miling: manufacturer: partner lab: de, fr (germany and france): it: sp (spain) uk: - **percentage representation:** - **in-lab miling:** - 34% - **manufacturer:** - 52% - **partner lab:** - 40% - **spanish making:** - 52% (manufacturer channel) - **it:** - 65% - **partner lab:** - 59% - **data interpretation:** - **in-lab miling:** - it shows high dependency on in-house processes. - **manufacturer:** - significant portion indicating the importance of this channel. - **partner lab:** - highest channel usage in spain signifying strategic partnerships. - **countries with notable trends:** - germany and france use more manufacturing or milling centers, while spain and the uk show different patterns due to their different industrial focus. *source:** the graphs are extracted from the \"key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_ summary - 17\", indicating a focus on integrating digital technology in the domain of manufacturing, particularly in the dental industry, which could be deduced from the context. in summary, the image contains two bar charts illustrating how digital technologies are applied across various channels within different industrial sectors and specific regions in europe, highlighting the varying degrees of reliance and the strategic importance of each channel.", "type": "Document"}}
