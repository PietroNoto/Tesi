the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. 2015: 201 cases the situation is quite similar to the past edition, with the exception of a slight decrease in users of digital technologies who also feel comfortable. the most relevant differences in the stance versus the digital technologies can be observed between digital prosthesis providers and non providers, also, those using either a scanner or a milling unit stated not to feel uncomfortable versus the digital technologies. base: 282 cases (whole sample) the image contains a table with responses categorized into four different colored sections. each category represents a different stance on the use of digital technologies. the respective colors are dark blue, blue, light blue, and grey. **dark blue (\"i feel uncomfortable and rather far from them\")**: this color signifies respondents who feel uneasy or distant from digital technologies. this group represents a low percentage of users, indicating a minority sentiment. **blue (\"i am using digital technologies because i need, but i am not comfortable with it\")**: this color denotes those who use digital technologies out of necessity but do not feel at ease with these tools. this category accounts for a moderate number of respondents. **light blue (\"i am getting closer to them because i think they are the future of prosthetics\")**: this category includes individuals who actively engage with digital technologies, driven by the belief that these are pivotal in the field of prosthetics. the proportion of users in this grouping is significant, reflecting a forward-thinking stance. **grey (\"i am using digital technologies and i am comfortable with it\")**: this color represents respondents who are both using digital technologies and are comfortable with them. the largest group in this table, indicated by this color, suggests a significant proportion of users who feel at ease and accept digital technologies in their work with prosthetics. the table highlights the distribution and sentiment among the users of digital technologies in the context of prosthetics. the visual categorization aids in distinguishing the varied levels of comfort and adoption of digital technologies by respondents, with the largest segment indicating a high level of confidence and comfort with digital tools in the field of prosthetics. the image contains a pie chart at the top with various colored segments representing the distribution of responses to a survey question about stance and digital technologies. here are the details of the pie chart segments: the largest segment is colored blue and represents 59% of the responses. the second-largest segment is colored dark blue and represents 18%. there is a smaller purple segment occupying 9%. a segment colored gray represents 14%. below this pie chart, there is an analysis of the survey data which mentions that the situation is similar to the previous edition with a slight decrease in users of digital technologies who feel comfortable. the study highlights the differences in stance versus the digital technologies across groups such as digital prosthesis providers, non-providers, millers, and owners of digital technologies. it notes that there is no significant statistical difference in the distribution below a 2% threshold. additionally, it specifically details usage and comfort levels among these groups in the context of digital technologies. the pie chart depicted in image-2 is identical to the one described in the analysis, indicating a similar distribution of respondents into four segments: 59% (blue segment) 18% (dark blue segment) 14% (gray segment) 9% (purple segment) the visual and textual context provided in the accompanying analysis is consistent with the pie chart shown, confirming the breakdown of responses as described in the first image. this aligns to the scenario detailed in \"omnivision digital,\" emphasizing the similar stance versus digital technology distribution data observed in the study. the image contains a pie chart that provides insights into the stance of individuals regarding their relationship with digital technologies compared to their physical surroundings in different sectors. the chart categorizes respondents into four groups based on their stance: digital prosthesis providers, technology owners, partner/channel, and the rest who are non-providers (likely including those using a scanner or milling unit). the data presented in this chart is extracted from a sample of 282 cases and represents the entire population. the pie chart is divided into five segments of varying sizes, each representing the percentage of respondents who hold specific stances: 1. **digital prosthesis providers:** this segment is the largest, comprising 57% of the pie chart, indicating that a majority of individuals in this category feel uncomfortable and would rather be far from digital technologies. 2. **non-providers (possibly including scanner and milling use):** this segment is a significant portion at 18%. it suggests that a considerable group uses digital technologies for tasks such as scanning or milling units but still feels uncomfortable around them. 3. **technology owners:** this segment makes up 14% of the respondents, suggesting that owners who utilize digital technologies hold a stance of getting closer to them because they think they are the future of digital technologies. 4. **partner/channel:** representing 14%, this segment indicates that individuals who work with digital technologies for partner or channel purposes use them regularly but feel uncomfortable around them. 5. **other:** there are 9% of respondents who feel the same way as the rest, indicating their discomfort toward digital technologies. the smaller segments in the pie chart, labeled as 7% for each, suggest that a smaller but significant portion of respondents either actively use digital technologies but are not comfortable around them because they need them (blue section) or use digital technologies feeling comfortable around them (light blue section), but these proportions do not fully meet the criterion set by the source note stating differences of +/ 2% should be considered non-statistical. the pie chart's design is simple and clear with each segment clearly labeled and differentiated by color to make comparisons easy. the chart is designed to reflect the significant differences in approach towards digital technologies among various stakeholder groups, showing where the comfort levels and preferences lie, based on the stakeholders' roles. in summary, the pie chart succinctly maps the varied degrees of comfort and approach toward digital technologies across different stakeholder groups, providing valuable insights into the relationship between individuals and digital technologies they interact with. the image contains the second part of the data presented in the first image, which is further analyzed in detail. the second image uses a bar chart to display respondent perceptions of whether they feel uncomfortable and \"rather far from them\" of various entities in the dental industry: digital prosthesis providers, technology, channel, and digital technologies owners. the bar chart format helps visualize the responses and their respective percentages in a more straightforward manner. for each entity, there are three responses represented by different shades of blue: dark blue indicates \"i feel uncomfortable and rather far from them.\" light blue denotes \"i am using digital technologies because i need it, but i am not comfortable with it.\" a slightly lighter blue shows \"i am getting closer to them because i think they are the future of prosthetics.\" the percentages for each response are provided next to each bar to provide a numerical breakdown of the respondents' sentiments. here is the breakdown of the data as visualized: **digital prosthesis providers**: - 24% use digital technologies because they are the future of prosthetics. - 60% feel uncomfortable and far from them. - 16% need to use digital technologies but remain uncomfortable with them. **technology**: - 58% feel uncomfortable and far from them. - 25% need digital technologies but still feel uncomfortable. - 18% believe in the future of technologies. **channel**: - 62% feel uncomfortable and far from them. - 23% need digital technologies but not comfortable with it. - 15% believe these technologies are the future. **digital technologies owners**: - 64% feels comfortable using digital technologies. - 35% are getting closer to them because they are the future. - 61% need digital technologies but not without discomfort. additional elements include the context of \"2015: 201 cases,\" and a caveat stating that differences of +/- 2% are considered non-statistically relevant. the study indicates a base sample of 282 cases. the image, combined with the detailed percentages, provides a clear picture of how stakeholders within the dental industry perceive the adoption of and comfort with digital technologies. it underscores the need for further education and reassurance among users as this technology rapidly gains importance in the industry.", "type": "Document"}}
