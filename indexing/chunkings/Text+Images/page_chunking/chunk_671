\"yes, because we are going to purchase the digital equipment\" representing 10%. - \"yes, because we will return to external partners (partner lab, milling centers) to produce prostheses with digital technologies\" representing 12%. below this, the text indicates that 21% of those not yet providing cad-cam produced prosthetic elements indicate an intention to start doing so within the next year. names of companies being considered for purchase in this timeframe include dental wings, dentaply sirona, bego, zirkonznah, 3shape, and open technologies. further down, another segment of the text indicates that: south and islands (33%). owner's age 55 (11%). opening year 1999-2018 (36%). *2015 - technology intention to buy:** this smaller chart is similar but slightly more divided, showing the intention to buy with two segments. the \"no\" segment is 75%, occupying most of the chart area. the \"yes\" segment is 25%, smaller in size compared to the \"technology intention to buy\" chart. at the bottom, additional notes highlight the statistical significance: \"the differences below +/- -2% should be considered not statistically relevant.\" the image also includes a visual graphic at the bottom related to opening year, with an icon of a monitor displaying a human jaw. it features an upward arrow, labeled \"intention to buy,\" reflecting the statistical data provided. a watermark indicates \"base: 183 cases (not providing digital restorations)\" and \"omivision digital\" branding by the bottom-left corner.", "type": "Document"}}
