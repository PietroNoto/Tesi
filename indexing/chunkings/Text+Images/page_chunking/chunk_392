**dark blue (know the brand as a manufacturer of cad-cam equipment):** 21% - **light blue (know the brand as both manufacturer of cad-cam equipment and another product):** 45% - **gray (know the brand as manufacturer of different products, not necessarily cad-cam):** 34% 2. **planmecca:** -

the boxes are color-coded in grey, blue, and dark green, indicating different levels of association or awareness. - **grey boxes**: represented by a light grey color, these indicate respondents who don't know if the brand is a manufacturer of either cad-cam equipment or other products distinct from cad-cam equipment. - **blue boxes**: represented by a medium grey color, these indicate respondents partially aware of the brands dual or single focus on cad-cam equipment. - **dark green boxes**: represent one tier of respondents completely aware and knowledgeable about the brand's products either being different from cad-cam equipment or exclusively focusing on cad-cam equipment. 2. **bar graph representation:** - the bars are color-coded in the same manner as the boxes (grey, blue, dark green) to represent different responses in a quantitative manner. - **percentage breakdown:** the chart visually denotes the proportion of respondents who are aware of the brand's manufacturing focus, distinguishing various categories that produce cad-cam equipment, cad-cam equipment and other products, or are solely manufacturers of cad-cam equipment. 3. **legend and legend symbols:** - icons representing different levels of consumer association with the given brands, each accompanied by textual descriptors that provide insight into the brands manufacturing capabilities and focus. - **\"red square\":** indicates a total lack of awareness or knowledge. - **\"yellow square\":** represents partial awareness or mixed responses. - **\"blue square\":** represents a mix of awareness across the entire spectrum of manufacturing focus. - **\"green square\":** indicates respondents who are fully aware and categorically certain of the brands manufacturing focus. in this image, only the 3shape brand is highlighted as being almost completely linked to the cad-cam segment compared to other brands listed (planmeccan, carestream, 3m, align). overall, the image's visual arrangement is designed to give an at-a-glance overview, enabling readers to comprehend the brand association patterns and awareness levels of respondents rapidly. the layout and color scheme aim to clarify the distribution and level of knowledge among respondents about various brands within the cad-cam equipment market segment.", "type": "Document"}}
