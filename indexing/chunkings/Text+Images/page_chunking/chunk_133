market share: 31% - the longest bar in the graph, emphasizing their significant percentage among users. 2. **3m:** - market share: 16% - the visual bar is shorter, indicating a smaller percentage share compared to iovclar vivadent. 3. **zirkonzahn:** - market share: 15% - a notable share, slightly longer than 3m but not as dominant as iovclar vivadent. 4. **amangirrbach:** - market share: 14% - only slightly shorter than zirkonzahn, suggesting a close competition. 5. **dentsply sirona:** - market share: 11% - slightly shorter, indicating a moderate presence in the market. 6. **vita:** - market share: 10% - less compared to dentsply sirona, maintaining a notable presence. other companies such as bego, noritake, orodent, nacera, nobel biocare, gc, siladent, dental direkt, anaxdent, and bredent follow with varying market shares ranging from 7% to 2%. finally, there is a category labeled \"otro,\" which contains 27% of the total market, indicating the combined percentage of all other companies not individually listed. the entire bar graph is divided into two main groups, distinguished by color: blue for in-house users and green for partner-lab users. *summary contextualization:** this graph appears to be summarizing the market dominance and distribution among different companies in the materials for fresh concrete structures. the primary company, iovclar vivadent, has the largest market share for in-house users, followed by 3m, zirkonzahn, and amangirrbach. among partner-lab users, other smaller players such as dental direkt, anaxdent, and bredent maintain significant shares. the \"otro\" category shows the cumulative share attributed to all minor categories, indicating a substantial part of the market share attributed to companies not individually represented. the two graphs in the first image, while visually similar, use different bases, with the left graph using 163 cases (base-distribuci\u00f3n num\u00e9rica) and the right one using 3,649 structures (base: 3,649 estructuras). this illustrates that the data in the left graph focuses on numerical representation (cases) and the market share (percentage of clients using one or more determinants) in in-house and partner-lab environments. meanwhile, the right graph focuses on market share for in-house users explicitly. the image contains a bar chart detailing the distribution of market share (\u201cdistribuci\u00f3n num\u00e9rica\u201d) and elements produced in several laboratories for fresh dental structures. this chart provides a visual representation of how market share across different dental structure producers is divided, highlighting major players like ivocular vivadent, amanngirrbahch, and zirkonzahn. *title information and sections:** the title is 'materiales para estructuras fresadas: distribuci\u00f3n num\u00e9rica y cuota elementos' in bold text, indicating the focus on fresh dental structure materials. two main sections are present: 1. **distribuci\u00f3n num\u00e9rica (distribution number)** - includes companies: - **ivocular vivadent 31%** (dark blue bar) - **zirkonzahn 15%** (medium blue bar) - **amann girrbah 14%** (light blue bar) - **dentsply sirona 11%** (lightest blue bar) - **vita 8%** (very light blue bar) - **bego 7%** (blue bar) - **noritake 6%** (green bar) - **orodent 5%** (light green bar) - **nacera, nosabic, sj, anax dent, bredent, et. otra 27%** (grey bar for unknown companies) 2. **market share (solo vs dentistas y elementos producidos por laboratorios terceros)** - this section lists companies: - **ivocular vivadent 21%** (green bar) - **amann girrbah 16%** (dark green bar) - **zirkonzahn 15%** (darker green bar) - **3m 10%** (lighter green bar) - **dentsply sirona 9%** (lightest green bar) - **vita 7%** (blue bar) - **orodent 4%** (greenish blue bar) - **dental direkte 2%** (dark yellow-ish green bar) - **nacera, whitepeaks, bredent, et. otra 26%** (grey bar for unknown companies). *graph details:** each company\u2019s market share percentage is clearly displayed in bar format, enhancing the visual clarity. the bars are uniformly spaced and neatly arranged to ensure easy readability and comparison. percentages are aligned with respective bar lengths for an intuitive understanding. *company names and market segments:** the left side lists the company names with corresponding percentage values highlighted in color. companies with fewer percentages, such as **nacera**, **whitepeaks**, **bredent**, **gc**, **bego**, **nobel biomeric**, **noritake**, **siladent**, **anaxdent**, and unspecified companies grouped under categories like \u201cotro\u201d, provide a comprehensive view of market distribution. overall, the image demonstrates a clear distribution of market shares among various dental structure companies, indicating a high concentration of market holders and a significant portion of market share held by the top players. the design facilitates an easy understanding of market dominance and potential areas for competition or strategic collaboration.", "type": "Document"}}
