the graph displays a significant segment of dental practices in the first column, depicting \"regularly\" and \"often\" users of digital technologies. - \"regularly\" is represented by a column comprising 65% of dental practices, and \"often\" is marked by a column comprising 35% of dental practices. - below, the graph breaks this data further into even more granular categories: - \"seldom\" with a 15% share. - \"never\" with a 10% share. - additionally, an arrow points to a box detailing \"percentage of dental practices.\" the \"regularly\" column is visualized as three stacked bars, while the \"often\" column is represented as two stacked bars. these percentages underline the usage trends within dental practices in 2015. 2. **year 2018** - the subsequent bar graph from 2018 again reveals usage trends for \"regularly\" and \"often.\" - here, the \"regularly\" column is smaller, depicting a 63% of dental practices, while the \"often\" column shows a notable increase to 37%. - similar to the previous graph, the detailed breakdown includes: - \"seldom\" for 17% usage. - \"never\" for 12% usage. - the \"regularly\" and \"often\" columns again feature bars for illustrating these percentages. *analysis in context of first image:** the first image highlights comparisons in the usage of digital technologies across two different years, 2015 and a larger portion of dental practices reported using these technologies consistently in 2018, showing significant progress in digital adoption. for instance, there's a noticeable increase from 35% to 37% in the \"often\" column between the two years, indicating a growth in routine use of digital tools by dental professionals. *additional observations:** the image also provides statistical information specific to \"digital prostheis providers,\" indicating: - that digital prosthesis providers are likely younger, with most younger than 45 years (76%). - their ownership involves a significant number of dental units (49% in one unit; 79% in three or more units). - their weekly patient workload varies, with a larger proportion seeing 50+ patients per week (86%). these visual aids emphasize increasing reliance on digital tools, with more practices moving toward routine use, reflecting broader trends in technology integration in dental health practices.", "type": "Document"}}
