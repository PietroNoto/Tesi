the data is divided into six categories, displayed as titles on the horizontal bar charts: digit. restor. provider (dental restorative providers) technology (types of restorative technologies) channel (channels for distribution or service) - each category lists three options that reflect different aspects of how dentists and technicians' roles might evolve with technology: 'no,' 'yes,' and a series of more specific technological or procedural components like in-lab milling, scanning, full outsourcing, manufacturer, and partner lab. 2. **horizontal bar charts**: - the bar charts employ shades of blue and beige to differentiate the 'no,' 'yes,' and percentage values. - each categorical axis on the left shows different technologies or procedural roles. the primary colors in the bars represent the percentage of respondents who agreed or disagreed. - **digit. restor. provider (no)**: 22% - **digit. restor. provider (yes)**: 64% - **technology (in-lab milling)**: 15% - **technology (scanning)**: 74% - **technology (full outsourcing)**: 41% - **technology (manufacturer)**: 21% - **technology (partner lab)**: 26% - **technology channel (in-lab milling)**: 11% - **technology channel (digit. restor. manufacturer)**: 65% - **technology channel (scanning)**: 11% - **technology channel (full outsourcing)**: 23% 3. **additional notes and assumptions**: - a footnote indicates that the roles will change because: - everyone will always need to perform their own distinct role. - the cooperation between dentists and technicians will increase due to critical areas like esthetics and digital processing. - technicians may need more expertise about restoratives technologies and aesthetics. - the roles of technicians may evolve due to the shift towards full outsourcing. ### contextual analysis: in the context of the first image, which provides an overview of how dental professionals might perceive future changes in roles, this second image is a detailed breakdown of the perceptions of specific tools, technologies, and procedures that inform those broader categories of change. it highlights how different respondents feel towards certain technology applications and full outsourcing channels, offering a nuanced view of future expectations. the image contains a textual summary of the survey responses from a study conducted by omnivision and key-stone. it presents the distribution of opinions about how the roles of dentists and technicians will change in the future due to new digital technologies. the data is visualized with a bar graph and pie chart. in the bar graph: \"no\" has 19% of the responses. \"yes\" is represented by 22%, which is slightly higher than \"no.\" below the main categories, there are three narrower categories: - \"in-lab mill\" has a small percentage of 3%. - \"full outsourcing\" is 25%. - \"manufacturer partner lab\" is 14%. - each narrow category shows lesser percentages. the pie chart provides a more detailed view, with the following distribution: 21% believe there will be \"full outsourcing.\" 22% think in \"manufacturer partner lab.\" \"in-lab mill\" and \"do not know\" have 2% and 1%, respectively. technically, \"scanning\" is represented as 50%, and \"digit. restorer. provider\" as 25%. \"yes\" is 64%, and \"technology\" is 17%. this shows that \"scanning\" is more likely regarded as part of 'technology,' whereas \"digit. restorer. provider\" may be interpreted as focusing on 'full outsourcing.' in the textual description: \"omnivision digital\" and \"key-stone\" are highlighted. the context given is that \"there will not be any change at all has 19%, \"cooperation between dentists and technicians will increase,\" and that dentists might need more expertise in prosthetics, which would be required to perform parts of the work in charge of technicians holds significant portion (64%). this suggests an increased role of cooperation and expertise as perceived by survey participants.", "type": "Document"}}
