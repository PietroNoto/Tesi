green bars represent amann girbach. - blue bars represent sirola. - red bars represent dentspyv. for each company group, both satisfaction (measured on the vertical axis ranging from 6.0 to 8.0) and perceived value (measured on the vertical axis ranging from 6.0 to 8.3) are shown for one bar per company group. *satisfaction:** amann girbach has a satisfaction score of 8. sirola has a satisfaction score of 7. dentspyv has a satisfaction score of 7.8. *perceived value:** amann girbach has a perceived value score of 6. sirola has a perceived value score of 6. dentspyv has a perceived value score of 7.2. *bar graph 2 (right):** this bar graph exclusively shows satisfaction for the same companies compared above. similar companies and colors are used for the respective companies: -
