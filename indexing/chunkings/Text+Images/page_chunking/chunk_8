longer bars indicate higher percentages of usage. 3. **technology categories & percentages:** - **impressions/models sent to a partner lab**: 80% - by far the highest percentage usage, indicating a significant reliance on sending dental impressions to a partner lab for processing. - **impressions/models sent to a cad-cam manuf/milling center**: 14% - shown as equally popular as the chairside milling system, implying a substantial number of respondents use cad-cam centers for dental fabrication. - **i have a chairside milling system**: 14% - reflects the prevalence of on-site dental milling technology among respondents. - **intraoral scanner files sent to a partner lab**: 9% - represents the next highest percentage for file transfer. - **intraoral scanner files sent to a cad-cam manuf/milling center**: 4% - shows the least percentage, suggesting lesser utilization of these methods in comparison to the more traditional methods. - **don't know**: 1% - a minimal percentage of respondents did not know or were unsure of their usage patterns. 4. **miscellaneous information:** - the overall observation from the percentages suggests that traditional send-to-partner-lab methods dominate, with intraoral scanners and cad-cam centrally based systems showing lesser utilization. - the 14% usage of chairside milling systems suggests a growing trend of using local, on-site technologies, possibly due to speed, convenience, or reduced travel time. - the 80% usage of sending impressions/models to a partner lab denotes a strong existing network or preference for these traditional methods. the 1% \"don't know\" signifies uncertainty in some responses. ### analysis based on first image insights: the data provided above indicates that traditional methods continue to dominate in this industry, with significant preference for sending digital files and impressions to external labs (traditionally known) over on-site processing technologies like cad-cam systems. despite advancements in chairside milling systems, their usage is relatively similar to cad-cam systems, suggesting a balanced reliance on innovative and traditional setups. this analysis helps in understanding technological adoption trends in a specific industry, indicating that despite technological improvements, traditional practices still hold strong. companies might benefit from analyzing these trends further to strategize their technological implementations based on the most prevalent methods.", "type": "Document"}}
