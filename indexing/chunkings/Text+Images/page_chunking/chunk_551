the image contains a continuation of a presentation slide from the first image, focusing specifically on a bar chart that details the correlation of various brand positioning items with customer recommendation. the chart is titled \"brand image vs recommendation - correlation analysis\" and is part of a broader discussion on how different factors influence recommendations. the title question posed on the slide asks, how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? the specific section of the slide, as seen in the second image, presents a horizontal bar chart with the x-axis labeled \"items weight on recommendation\" and the y-axis listing different brand image attributes such as \"makes daily practice easier,\" \"trustworthy,\" \"innovative and at the forefront,\" \"highly reputable,\" \"customer service oriented,\" \"reliable,\" \"good price quality ratio,\" \"leading company,\" \"worldwide renowned,\" \"affordable,\" and \"too expensive (-0.016).\" each bar represents the correlation score of specific brand attributes with the overall recommendation. the bars are purple and feature their respective correlation values: makes daily practice easier: 0.542 trustworthy: 0.533 innovative and at the forefront: 0.529 highly reputable: 0.525 customer service oriented: 0.509 reliable: 0.488 good price quality ratio: 0.403 leading company: 0.380 worldwide renowned: 0.348 affordable: 0.338 too expensive: -0.016 each bar is relatively close in length, indicating that the various brand image attributes have somewhat comparable contributions to the recommendation score of a product or service. the negative score for \"too expensive\" highlights that this factor might have an inverse effect on recommendation, suggesting that being perceived as too expensive detriminately impacts customer satisfaction. the image shows a bar chart titled \"brand image vs recommendation - correlation analysis,\" which analyzes the items' values associated with a recommendation scenario. the chart contains two main columns, \"items weight on recommendation\" and \"items score,\" providing a correlation study on how much each item weighs on a recommendation basis and the resulting score. the following elements are evident in the image: 1. **title and header:** - at the top, the chart is titled \"brand image vs recommendation - correlation analysis.\" - beneath the title, a subtitle asks \"how much are worth the single items on the recommendation?\" 2. **description box on the left:** - below the title, there is a paragraph that discusses the \"bivariate correlation analysis.\" it explains the purpose and methodology for understanding how single factors influence recommendations, emphasizing the need to analyze the different weight of factors within recommendations. - the paragraph further elaborates on the use of \"binaviate correlation analysis\" to determine how much each factor contributes to the overall recommendation. 3. **chart elements:** - the leftmost column lists various items considered in the analysis, numbered from 1 to 10, as follows: makes daily practice easier trustworthy innovative and at the forefront highly reputable customer service oriented reliable good price quality ratio leading company worldwide renowned affordable - the middle column directly aligned with the items lists the \"items weight on recommendation\" scores associated with each item. these scores are represented as numerical values: 1. 0.542 2. 0.533 3. 0.529 4. 0.525 5. 0.509 6. 0.488 7. 0.403 8. 0.380 9. 0.348 10. -0.016 - the far-right column displays the \"items score\" associated with each item, presented in terms of a bar graph: 1. 4.08 2. 4.23 3. 4.21 4. 4.24 5. 3.96 6. 4.25 7. 3.75 8. 3.98 9. 4.09 10. 3.57 each bar on the right-hand side represents the score achieved by the respective items, with the numerical labels on the left side specifying the weights or importance of each factor in the recommendation process. the most substantial items in terms of recommendation weight include making daily practice easier, trustworthy, innovative and at the forefront, and highly reputable. the least significant items, according to their weights, are customer service oriented, reliable, and worldwider renowned. the overall item scoring provides an insightful view of how each individual factor influences the recommendation, with 4.08 being the highest and -0.016 being the lowest.", "type": "Document"}}
