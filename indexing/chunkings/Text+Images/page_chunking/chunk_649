how much money are you willing to spend (per year) on your own and your staff education? 13,3 10,9 11,4 13,4 11,2 2.252 1.850 1.353 1.626 1.633 average number of days per year 12,1 expected average budget per year average number of technicians 5,4 7,5 5,3 3,3 4,4 6,1 the original answer regards the total number of days per year for laboratory staff. the data on the average number of technicians in the laboratory has been added later to derive the number of hours per capita to be spent on training. while the overall total number of hours is not very different between countries, introducing the average number of technicians, it can be seen that the hours per capita are lower in countries where there is a higher density of technicians per laboratory, while they are higher where the number of technicians per laboratory is lower. spain and italy are still the least digitized countries, but they are growing rapidly: more training and education needs are present. average number of days / technician / year 2,2 1,8 2,1 3,5 3,0 1,8 labo base: 594 cases cases 137 114 125 113 105 the image contains a segment of a larger infographic that breaks down the distribution of the average number of days per year dedicated to education among laboratory technologists in five european countries: germany, france, italy, spain, and the united kingdom. this segment appears to be a sub-section of an earlier larger infographic, which is not shown here but provides context likely related to the time and budget commitment to education and training within these countries' labs. here's a more detailed breakdown: 1. **country-specific breakdowns**: - **germany**: - **up to 5 days per year:** 39% - **from 6 to 10 days per year:** 24% - **more than 10 days per year:** 33% - **don't know / no answer:** 4% - **france**: - **up to 5 days per year:** 30% - **from 6 to 10 days per year:** 41% - **more than 10 days per year:** 26% - **don't know / no answer:** 3% - **italy**: - **up to 5 days per year:** 38% - **from 6 to 10 days per year:** 32% - **more than 10 days per year:** 19% - **don't know / no answer:** 11% - **spain**: - **up to 5 days per year:** 43% - **from 6 to 10 days per year:** 19% - **more than 10 days per year:** 27% - **don't know / no answer:** 11% - **uk**: - **up to 5 days per year:** 27% - **from 6 to 10 days per year:** 33% - **more than 10 days per year:** 36% - **don't know / no answer:** 3% 2. **graph representation**: - each countrys data is organized as a stacked horizontal bar chart. the bars are color-coded where darker shades (larger portions) indicate higher numbers of days dedicated to education and training. - blue bars represent the higher range (6+ days per year), darker shades indicating an increasing commitment. - grey indicates the proportion of respondents who have provided estimates outside of these ranges. - the segmented format allows for an immediate visual comparison of education time dedications across the five countries. 3. **data source and attribution**: - the bottom of the segment displays the name \"ln1v1s1on digital\" which likely refers to the digital platform or the company that created the infographic. the right side of the page has the label \"key-stone,\" which seems to be the overall publisher or sponsor related to the full research or report. overall, the segment analyzes and visually represents the varying commitment to laboratory education among technologists across europe, highlighting the percentage ranges and the countries' dedicated efforts in skill development through formal education and training programs. the image contains a pie chart segmenting responses to a survey inquiry about the time dedication toward training and education per year for lab staff. the pie chart represents various options broken down by a percentage distribution. these options include: 1. **\"up to 5 days per year\"**: this section of the pie is colored dark blue, and it represents 30% of responses. 2. **\"from 6 to 10 days per year\"**: this section shares the same dark blue color and accounts for another 30% of the responses. 3. **\"more than 10 days per year\"**: represented in a light blue shade, this portion of the pie chart makes up 34% of the data set. 4. **\"don't know / no answer\"**: the smallest segment in the pie chart, colored lightest blue, accounts for 6% of the responses. the first image (as a contextual background for the second one) illustrates a detailed survey question and its visual representation. the context indicates this pie chart is a visual summary of one part of a comprehensive survey regarding educational dedication among lab staff. it also suggests additional data such as budget allocation and different country-wise dedications.", "type": "Document"}}
