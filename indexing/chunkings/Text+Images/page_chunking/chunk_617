**2018:** - red bar (fully disagree): 3% - yellow bar (partially disagree): 5% - light blue bar (neutral): 26% - dark blue bar (partially agree): 28% - dark grey bar (fully agree): 52% - **2015:** - red bar (fully disagree): 3% - yellow bar (partially disagree): 9% - light blue bar (neutral): 30% - dark blue bar (partially agree): 30% - dark grey bar (fully agree): 37% 2. **second row (statement b on the left):** - **2018:** - red bar (fully disagree): 5% - yellow bar (partially disagree): 9% - light blue bar (neutral): 30% - dark blue bar (partially agree): 30% - dark grey bar (fully agree): 37% - **2015:** - red bar (fully disagree): 5% - yellow bar (partially disagree): 9% - light blue bar (neutral): 30% - dark blue bar (partially agree): 30% - dark grey bar (fully agree): 37% 3. **third row (statement c on the left):** - **2018:** - red bar (fully disagree): 13% - yellow bar (partially disagree): 12% - light blue bar (neutral): 27% - dark blue bar (partially agree): 27% - dark grey bar (fully agree): 23% - **2015:** - red bar (fully disagree): 13% - yellow bar (partially disagree): 12% - light blue bar (neutral): 27% - dark blue bar (partially agree): 27% - dark grey bar (fully agree): 23% ### observations: 1. **general trend comparison:** - over the years, in 2018, there is a noticeable slight increase in full agreement for all the statements except for the third. - conversely, in 2015, the level of full agreement is higher compared to 2018 across all statements. 2. **statement comparison:** - statement b experiences the highest consistency in its opinion distribution from 2015 to 2018. - there is a noticeable decline or equality in the percentages for statement b compared to a and c, maintaining a steady full agreement. 3. **statistical insights:** - for all statements, the percentage of disagreement or neutral responses generally drops from 2015 to 2018, indicating an overall trend towards more agreement. - slight variations are observed across each statement concerning partial disagreement, but it is generally low compared to full and partial agreement metrics. this detailed analysis encapsulates the core elements and trends within the stacked bar chart, offering a comprehensive understanding of public opinion regarding 3d printings effects on dentistry across two years. the image contains a line graph extracted from the first image, which appears to be a part of a larger statistical analysis concerning the perception of dentistry brought about by 3d printing. the line graph, located on the right side of the first image, visually demonstrates the trend analysis of agreement percentages over two different years: 2015 and 2018. *content description:** **axes and labels:** - the x-axis represents the year and is broken into two data points: 2015 and 2018. - the y-axis represents the percentage of respondents agreement, but the specific scale from 0 to 100 is not visible in the cropped part of the graph. - there are clearly marked circular points for the year 2015 at 3.9% and for the year 2018 at 4.2%. **line connection:** - a line extends from the 2015 point to the 2018 point, indicating the trend over these years. the line points connect the year 2015 to 3.9% and then to the year 2018, connected to 4.2%, suggesting an increase in the percentage over this time period. **color and styling:** - the line graph uses a turquoise shade for the line and shading around both data points. - the two data points and the connecting line are highlighted to clearly convey the trend visually. this line graph likely serves as a concise visual representation aimed at quickly conveying the percentage increase in agreement regarding the impact of 3d printing on dentistry over a span of three years by highlighting the specific data points relevant to each year. the image contains three vertically-aligned statements regarding the impact of 3d printing on dentistry, specifically the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally, the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow, and the costs of restorations. the text is written in black font on a white background and is presented in a clear, straightforward manner. the statements are formatted as follows: the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks the text is structured in three small blocks, each with a description and a list of percentage ratios under a bar chart that visually represents the respondents' agreement with each statement, from completely disagree through to completely agree. the color coding differentiates the responses (red for \"fully disagree,\" orange for \"partially disagree,\" yellow for \"neutral,\" light green for \"partially agree,\" and dark green for \"fully agree\"). additionally, there are two trend analysis tables in the upper right corner. these tables show the percentage of respondents who agree with each statement in 2018 and 2015, presenting a time trend. a smaller image of the same three statements is positioned below the bar chart, serving as a textual summary. this smaller image appears to be a standalone component extracted from the first, providing a direct reference back to the main table. advertisements from companies, \"omnivision digital\" and \"key-stone,\" are in the lower-left corner, indicating sponsorship or association with the content. please note that the question specifically asked to analyze a smaller section within the larger image, focusing on the second image content which is a standalone repeat of the three statements regarding their significance in dentistry. thus, analysis is limited strictly to this portion.", "type": "Document"}}
