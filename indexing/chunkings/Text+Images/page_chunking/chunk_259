all brands in your opinion, how do you rate the mentioned brands in the following areas? 50 (scores: 1 totally irrelevant, 2 partially irrelevant, 3 neutral, 4 quite relevant, 5 totally relevant) this chart displays the overall average scores obtained by the investigated brands concerning specific attributes. the goal of the analysis is to compare the overall results with those obtained by the investigated brands to find out which items most significantly characterize the perceived image of each brand under investigation. the image contains a line graph, specifically a type of numerical or sequence diagram, highlighting a series of numerical data points arranged in descending order against a white background. the sequence numbers represented are depicted using circles and lines to indicate a progression from an initial point of 4,3 through a series of descending values until it reaches 3, the line connecting each circle is colored in pinkish-red hues and the numbers within them are highlighted in bright pink as well. each of these circles contains the following sequence of data points starting from 4,3 down to 3,1, but the specific numbers between these points vary widely, indicating fluctuations commonly seen in analytical or statistical graphics. the values are spaced at regular intervals, emphasizing their ordinal progression from higher to lower on the represented metric. the data sequence starts at the left, with sequential circle numbers incrementately decreasing towards to the right, suggesting a logical decrement of values. the circles are uniform, maintaining a consistent round shape without any evident gaps between them, indicating a smooth transition. there appear to be text elements and possibly annotations or legends near the end of the sequence but they are not clearly visible due to the nature and resolution of the image in question. the background is uniformly clean and white, with the colorful sequence being the main visual focus. each segment maintains its distinct numerical representation and visual coherence. each of the individual elements in the sequence is colored in an aesthetically coherent and logical descending color palette, maintaining a visually intuitive transition from the highest numbers down to the lowest, forming an overall smooth and descending visual path. the color and number pairing appear to be methodically chosen to reflect a cohesively decreasing sequence. the focus and clarity center around the progression of these numerical data points in a sequential order, capturing attention to their relative distances and progression. the image contains a detailed table titled \"brand image: focus on brands - all brands\", which is partially shown within a larger frame that also includes the brand equity logo and additional text context. the table is designed to understand how respondents rate different aspects of a brand. it provides scores ranging from 1 (totally irrelevant) to 5 (totally relevant), allowing an assessment of the degree of importance of various statements to various respondents' perceptions. the following elements are distinct within the table: **header and labels:** the top of the first column has a header titled \"all brands (1,142 quotes),\" indicating a total of 1,142 different responses or opinions. the scores are labeled at the top left as \"scores: 1 totally irrelevant, 2 partially irrelevant, 3 neutral, 4 quite relevant, 5 totally relevant.\" **questions about brands:** the table includes statements about the brands: - this company has a high reputation. - this company has products with the highest quality. - this company has a long-time tradition. - the products of this company are the easiest to use. - i trust this company more than others. - i think that it is the right company when i look for innovation. - i feel this company to be among the most customer-oriented ones. - i feel this company to be among the most familiar and friendly one. - this company supports my business development more than others. - the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio. **responses and rescale to mean:** each statement is associated with a section of colored bars: - yellow for totally irrelevent or neutral responses. - orange for partially irrelevant or neutral responses. - red for neutral responses. - green for quite relevant or neutral responses. - blue for totally relevant responses. this color scale provides a visual representation of how many respondents agreed that the statements are important, neutral, or irrelevant to their perception of the brand. each statement has a horizontal array of colored bars indicating respondents' feedback: the bar colors in the answers are next to each percentage, depicting the spread of responses from a range of neutral to highly relevant. the mean scores in the top right corner are provided as visual metrics, such as \"4.3\" for the statement \"this company has a high reputation.\" overall, the table provides a clear and structured analysis of customer perception of brands, segmenting responses by categorical scores and visually representing them for analysis.", "type": "Document"}}
