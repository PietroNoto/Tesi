(multiple answer - analysis on: the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks) 28 base: 722 cases the whole sample seems to be not particularly convinced that 3d printing will bring a reduction in the costs of the consumable materials, as the overall average of positive responses is 45% only. uk looks to be the most positive country, with 58% of yes, while the least positive one looks to be france, with 33%. spain is very close to france, with 34% of yes. the image contains a graphical representation that is divided into three main sections. at the center, there is a cluster of statistical data presented in a clustered bar chart format. the chart has two main types of bars: dark blue, which are labeled \"yes,\" and grey, which are labeled \"don't know.\" each bar in the chart represents one country, with the height of the bars indicating the percentage of responses for each category. on the left side of the chart, the title reads \"which of the following statements do you agree on, with regard to the main consequences that 3d printing will bring to the dentistry? multiple answer - analysis on: the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks.\" this section details the main focus of the survey, suggesting that the chart visualizes respondents' agreement on whether the costs of restorations will decrease due to the lower cost of materials compared to cad-cam blocks. the clustered bars from left to right represent data for five different countries: germany (de) - \"yes\" bars: 49%, 49%, 62%, and a 2% portion in \"don't know\". france (fr) - \"yes\" bars: 33%, 49%, 62%, and a 5% portion in \"don't know\". italy (it) - \"yes\" bars: 41%, 46%, 13%, and a 20% portion in \"don't know\". spain (sp) - \"yes\" bars: 33%, 47%, 34%, and a 5% portion in \"don't know\". united kingdom (uk) - \"yes\" bars: 37%, 58%, and a 5% portion in \"don't know\". the overall structure of the chart indicates a comparative analysis of public opinion on the cost of restorations and the influence of 3d printing on these costs, across five european countries. the \"yes\" bars, showing higher percentages, suggest a positive view on the potential cost reduction, whereas the \"don't know\" grey bars indicate uncertainty in respondents' opinions in those percentages. the chart clearly aims to present and compare the responses on a comparative basis, offering insights into public perception regarding the cost implications of 3d printing in dentistry across european nations. the image contains a pie chart that visually represents data concerning opinions on the main consequences in dentistry brought by 3d printing. this particular chart, also featured in the first image, breaks down the responses to the sentiment that \"the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks.\" the primary color scheme used for the pie chart is blue for \"yes,\" gray for \"no,\" and a lighter shade of gray for \"don't know.\" here's a detailed analysis of the second pie chart: 1. **yes (45%)**: this section is visually represented by the portion of the pie chart colored in a lighter shade of blue and is the second largest piece of the chart. it accounts for 45% of the responses, indicating that nearly half of the participants agree that the introduction of 3d printing will lead to a reduction in the costs of restorations due to lower prices of materials compared to cad-cam blocks. 2. **no (48%)**: this section is colored in dark blue and represents 48% of the responses. the largest piece of the pie chart is in this color, denoting that more respondents disagree with or are uncertain about the cost-saving implications of 3d printing technologies on dental restorations. 3. **don't know (7%)**: this smallest segment of the pie chart is colored in the lightest gray, amounting to 7% of the responses. it suggests that a small portion of the surveyed individuals do not have an opinion or are not certain regarding this aspect. this pie chart succinctly summarizes the sentiments of respondents to the survey question about the primary benefits of 3d printing in dentistry. the largest segment highlights a significant portion of respondents holding a skeptical view, while a smaller portion clearly agrees and an even smaller portion of respondents are uncertain.", "type": "Document"}}
