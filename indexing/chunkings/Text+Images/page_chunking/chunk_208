(punt\u00e9 desde 1 \"completamente insatisfecho\" hasta 10 \"completamente satisfecho\"). this translates to \"considering each of the cad-cam brands used, rate your satisfaction with the following factors. (rated from 1 'completely dissatisfied' to 10 'completely satisfied').\" two sets of bars; on the left set (todas las marcas) contains 26 labels for analysis and bars representing different satisfaction levels, and on the right set (3shape) which presents the aggregated or average satisfaction scores within 3shape specifically. the chart includes a total of 16 different factors, each represented by a horizontal bar in the corresponding satisfaction levels, such as \"bastante satisfecho\", \"muy satisfecho\", \"no satisfecho\", \"no puede juzar\". the colors indicate from low (dark) to high (light) levels of satisfaction. the \"todas las marcas\" horizontal bar chart includes: **bastante satisfecho** in dark hues **muy satisfecho** in lighter hues **no satisfecho** in very light hues **no puede juzar** in very dark hues all labels on the left side of the 16th bar (the gray one) represent different levels of these four responses. each category has varying bar lengths across the factors. the \"3shape\" section shows average satisfaction percentages in color-coded bars (dark blue for low scores, lighter to bright blue for high scores), with individual levels annotated next to each corresponding bar (like \"bastro satisfecho\" 8% to \"muy satisfecho\" 69%). each bar in both sets is associated with specific factors of user satisfaction, such as \"facilitad de la pr\u00e1ctica diaria\", \"precisi\u00f3n y calidad global de las ferramentes\", etc. the overall layout is structured to show the detailed and aggregate responses separately and collectively. a key at the bottom correlates with the color of the bars to their specific satisfaction ratings as per the questionnaires. this detailed visual representation allows for easy comparison of satisfaction levels across different product brands and specific features within the 3shape product. the image contains a 3d molecular structure model depicting a protein or a complex molecule. this molecule is composed of numerous interconnected spheres, each labeled with specific numerical values ranging from 5 to these spheres represent atoms within the molecule, possibly indicating atomic weights, orbital numbers, or other scientific measurements. the spheres are connected by lines, suggestive of chemical bonds between atoms, forming a complex network. the varying colors of the spheres (including blue, pink, teal, and purple) might represent different types of atoms or chemical bonds, although the exact color coding is not explicitly explained in the image. the arrangement and interaction of these spheres follow a helical pattern, typical of many macromolecular structures such as proteins, where the atoms are arranged in a specific order to form a spatially efficient molecule. this is indicative of the natural order and symmetry found in molecular structures, which is essential for maintaining the stability and functionality of the molecule. the 3d model appears to be an informative diagram used in chemistry or molecular biology, likely indicating the geometric arrangement and interactions of atoms within a biological or chemical compound. this type of visual representation is crucial for understanding the spatial configuration in fields like drug design, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering. the image contains a detailed chart titled \"puntuaci\u00f3n de satisfacci\u00f3n: 3shape.\" it displays two primary sections: one section labeled \"todas las marcas\" which includes 538 mentions, and another section labeled \"3shape\" including 26 mentions. at the bottom of the chart, there's a vertical bar graph titled \"mean\" that visualizes the general satisfaction range from unsatisfied to very satisfied across all metrics. ### sections: #### todas las marcas (538 mentions) the first section shows bars representing satisfaction for various attributes: **facilita la pr\u00e1ctica diaria**: satisfaction scores are visually represented with a blue color, showing ranges of 25%, 28%, and 47%. **precision y calidad global de las restauraciones**: scores are shown as 25%, 33%, and 42%. **fiabilidad**: scores range from 29% to 44%. **aumento de productividad**: scores indicate satisfaction rates from 32% to 40%. **manejabilidad / f\u00e1cilidad de uso**: scores span from 32% to 37%. **soporte t\u00e9cnico de la empresa**: satisfaction rates vary from 29% to 37%. **amplia gama de procedimientos disponibles**: scores show a range starting from 37% to 33%. **amplia gama de materiales disponibles**: satisfaction reflects varied data from 37% to 30%. **disponibilidad y flexibilidad de la empresa**: satisfaction is from 46% to 28%. **asistencia t\u00e9cnica**: scores vary from 19% to 46%. **compatibilidad con otras marcas**: scores range between 47% and 34%. **costos generales de funcionamiento**: data is from 49% to 38%. **formaci\u00f3n de puesto en marca**: ranges from 46% to 49%. **apoyo al desarrollo empresarial**: scores indicate a high range from 48% to 28%. **frecuencia de actualizaciones de los softwares**: satisfaction rates are depicted from 48% to 34%. **costo de las actualizaciones de los softwares**: scores vary between 57% and 20%. below the main category is a section showing general satisfaction, represented with three horizontal bars showing percentages such as 30%, 39%, and 31%. #### 2. 3shape (26 mentions) the second section presents a similar format displaying satisfaction with 26 mentions but includes additional data: **satisfaction scores**: here, satisfaction ranges extend from individual user satisfaction with the product or service to overall user satisfaction. **general satisfaction**: the data from individual satisfaction to overall satisfaction are consolidated for 3shape, showing 8%, 23%, 38%, 46%, 69% indicating higher satisfaction levels in this segment. additional details such as \"mean\" on the vertical bar graph show the variability between the different satisfaction metrics. the chart employs a color-coded approach where blue represents satisfaction, yellow indicates neutral satisfaction, and red signifies dissatisfaction. the \"no puede juzgar\" (cannot judge) category is represented in gray. this ensures the visualization of varied user impressions and their respective levels of satisfaction across numerous aspects and product or service features, allowing a comprehensive review of user experiences.", "type": "Document"}}
