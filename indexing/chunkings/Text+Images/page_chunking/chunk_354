users 34 the map is the visual result of the two charts seem in the previous slide. in the horizontal axis there is the weight of each item on the satisfaction, in the vertical axis there is the overall satisfaction index of each item. the items are organized on the map in a manner that in the upper right part there are the items that a) are very relevant in the general satisfaction and b) the dentists are more satisfied than the average. in the lower part, on the other hand, there are items which a) are very relevant to overall satisfaction and b) the dentists are not more satisfied with than the average. this map shows the evaluated items in general for all the brands and it is a good reference to compare each brand. the image contains a detailed two-dimensional graph, often referred to as a scatter plot, which depicts the relationship between various aspects of satisfaction and how they impact the general satisfaction of users. this specific scatter plot is labeled \"correlation analysis: 'general satisfaction'\" and comes with a title: \"how much worth individual items on global satisfaction? users.\" the scatter plot is divided into three rows and six columns, with different items and criteria listed on the vertical and horizontal axes. the vertical axis is labeled \"items,\" while the horizontal axis is labeled \"weight on the satisfaction.\" heres a breakdown of the elements within the scatter plot: ### first row (items in general satisfaction): 1. **precisio and general quality of the restorations**: marked with a diamond-shaped blue pin, suggesting a high weight in satisfaction. 2. **trustworthy**: similarly marked with a blue diamond, indicating another key aspect of high satisfaction. 3. **wide range of materials available**: represented by another blue diamond. 4. **easy of use**: the next characteristic with a blue diamond mark. 5. **availability and flexibility of the companies in case of specific doubts**: showing with a blue diamond. 6. **enterprise technical support**: indicated by a blue diamond. ### second row (items influencing user satisfaction): 1. **frequency of software updates**: this is signified by yet another blue diamond located above the first row's items. 2. **overall operating costs**: once again, it gets a blue diamond mark. 3. **technical assistance in case of repair**: with a blue diamond pin. 4. **supporting the development of business**: finally, this aspect gets a blue diamond pin, completing the row. ### third row (items related to financial concerns): 1. **cost of softwares updating**: a diamond-shaped blue pin indicating its relevance to satisfaction. 2. **supporting the development of business**: another blue diamond, indicating it contributes to satisfaction. these items are graphically represented by blue diamond-shaped pins placed according to their weight or importance in terms of satisfaction, with their position on the horizontal axis (weight on the satisfaction) indicating their relative importance. additionally, the legend in the top right corner of the scatter plot helps in understanding the categorization of each element visually represented by a blue diamond. it includes the following aspects: **precisio and general quality of the restorations** **trustworthy** **wide range of materials available** **easy of use** **availability and flexibility of the companies in case of specific doubts** **enterprise technical support** **frequency of software updates** **overall operating costs** **technical assistance in case of repair** **supporting the development of business** **cost of softwares updating** the scatter plot is accompanied by a descriptive note that provides context: \"the map is the visual result of the two charts seen in the previous slide. in the horizontal axis there is the weight of each item on the satisfaction, in the vertical axis there is the overall satisfaction index of each item.\" additionally, the map provides further explanation: items on top right (e.g., frequent software updates) are more highly valued and correlated with satisfaction. items on the lower part and other side are less valued and less correlated with satisfaction. this map helps to provide a visualization of how these aspects impact satisfaction for a general user base, making it clear which elements are most crucial and which are less so regarding user satisfaction.", "type": "Document"}}
