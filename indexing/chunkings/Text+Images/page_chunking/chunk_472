in the following areas? 47 base: 326 quotes base: 129 quotes base: 126 quotes base: 170 quotes + mean score while sirona is rather on average, given the high number of quotes received, its interesting to note kavo performing better than the competitors with regard to affordability and customer service oriented, while 3m is more than other brands associated with too expensive and worldwide renowned. the image contains a detailed multi-line graph, prominently featured in the central portion of the slide. the graph comprises four lines representing different brands and their positions relative to several attributes. the lines are color-coded and labeled as follows: 1. **yellow** represents sirona. 2. **green** represents kavo. 3. **blue** represents 3m. 4. **red** represents others. each line on the graph shows the fluctuation and comparison of performance across several attributes over time. the horizontal axis of the graph lists nine attributes, which are: **recommendable to colleagues** **innovative and at the forefront** **customer service oriented** **affordable** **trustworthy** **too expensive** **highly reputable** **reliable** **makes daily practice easier** **good price quality ratio** **worldwide renowned** **leading company** the vertical axis does not have specific numerical values marked but is indicative of performance levels, with higher points on the graph indicating better performance in a particular attribute. the lines are interspersed throughout the graph, showing how each brand ranks in different attributes over time. different patterns and peaks on each line reflect the varying strengths and weaknesses of the brands across the attributes. notable observations from the graph include: **sirona** tends to exhibit fairly consistent performance but does not stand out prominently in any single attribute. **kavo** displays a more erratic trend with significant fluctuations, often showing high performance in certain attributes but also dipping in others. **3m** follows a relatively stable pattern with moderate performance in most attributes, not reaching high points but maintaining consistent values across the timeframe. **others** show a diverse performance, indicating a mix of strong attributes with some notable peaks highlighting specific strengths within the brand group. the graph uses a dotted line to indicate the mean score for each attribute category, providing a baseline for comparison. the mean scores demonstrate central tendencies, showing that some brands are considerably below and others above the average performance level in each attribute. overall, this graph reflects a dynamic and comparative analysis of brand performance across various attributes, providing a visual representation of which brands excel in certain areas and which ones need improvement based on customer feedback. the image contains a graph titled \"brand positioning: overall,\" which visually assesses and compares the brand ratings of sirona, kavo, 3m, and others across several attributes related to customer perception and brand value. the graph utilizes a color-coded scatterplot to represent brand attributes, with each brand represented by a distinct color. the primary objective of the graph is to present how the audience perceives these brands on various attributes, such as being \"recommendable to colleagues,\" \"innovative and at the forefront,\" \"customer service oriented,\" \"affordable,\" \"trustworthy,\" \"too expensive,\" \"highly reputable,\" \"reliable,\" \"makes daily practice easier,\" \"good price quality ratio,\" \"worldwide renowned,\" and \"leading company.\" the horizontal axis represents these attributes arranged in a way that allows for a clear comparison between the brands. each brand is clustered within different segments based on their rating scores, denoted by various values on the vertical axis corresponding to the mean scores, which presumably range from low to high scores. the specific placement for each brand can be observed as follows: **sirona:** appears prominently towards the higher end of the \"customer service oriented\" and \"innovative and at the forefront\" quadrants. it is also positioned notably lower in the \"too expensive,\" \"reliable,\" and \"worldwide renowned\" areas. **kavo:** positioned slightly lower than sirona in terms of customer service orientation but higher in terms of affordability, trustworthiness, reputability, ease of daily practice, and overall high value (leading company status). it is clustered closely next to 3m, yet distinctly differentiated based on several other attributes. **3m:** clustered with kavo in terms of overall leading company status and perceived value, with specific differentiations in attributes such as overall cost (relatively less expensive), reliability, and global renown. **others:** positioned broadly at the lower mid-ranking of most attributes, with a higher presence in attributes denoting lower value such as \"too expensive,\" \"reliability,\" or lower perceived overall value. the graph also includes a key to the right, listing which brand the various colors correspond to, and notes the number of quotes (base) each category is based on, which vary between categories (e.g., \"base: 326 quotes,\" \"base: 129 quotes,\" etc.). it can be inferred that sirona ranks relatively higher across innovation and customer service, but is seen mostly negatively in terms of price and overall cost perception. kavo balances significantly well across most attributes, suggesting it is perceived as both valuable and reliable. 3m shows a balanced performance leaning towards global renown and strong customer-oriented profiles. others demonstrate a more varied and less favorable general stand. this graph serves as a comprehensive visual aid to understand how each brand ranks across various critical consumer perceptions and values, helping stakeholders to quickly grasp the comparative strengths and weaknesses in the marketplace.", "type": "Document"}}
