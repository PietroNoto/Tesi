illustrated by a bar chart showing the preference for fixed versus removable restorations. the chart indicates that, compared to 2015, more restorations were fixed in 2018, represented by a blue bar that is higher than a red bar (indicating the 2015 proportion). this suggests a trend towards fixed restorations. 2. **material used**: - depicted with a bar chart contrasting different restorative materials from 2018 across neutral, fully related groups, and relatedness categories. one set of bars in yellow and grey indicates higher positive trends for specific materials used in restorations. 3. **more screw retained instead of cemented**: - indicated by a comparative bar chart showing that a greater preference or incidence of screw retainers rather than cemented restorations was observed in a higher, blue bar for 2018 suggests increased usage of screw retention over cementation techniques. 4. **more implant supported instead of tooth supported**: - illustrated by a bar chart showing restorative methods supported by implants versus those supported by natural teeth. a substantial, blue bar for 2018 compared to a red bar for 2015 reflects a notable increase in implant-supported restorations. the visual representation in the image emphasizes a few key shifts in dental restoration practices, suggesting a move towards more permanent and supportive restorations likely driven by advances in dental technology. each statistical comparison is color-coded and straightforward, making it clear that the focus is on quantifying differences across various restoration techniques over time. the image contains a set of bar graphs depicting the responses to the question, \"in your opinion, does the use of the digital technology change the type of restorations?\" with answers ranging from \"no\" to \"more fixed instead of removable restorations.\" ### detailed analysis: 1. **title and survey context**: - the survey's focal question revolves around the perception of digital technology's impact on the type of restorations conducted. - the two bar graphs represent responses from two years: 2015 and 2018, showing year-over-year changes. 2. **categories in the bar graphs**: - **no**: this category includes responses where respondents believe the use of digital technology doesn't change the type of restorations. - **more fixed instead of removable restorations**: this category indicates a shift towards the use of fixed restorations over removable ones, attributable to digital technological advancements. 3. **yearly differences**: - in 2015: - 44% of respondents answered \"no.\" - 56% of respondents indicated a shift towards \"more fixed instead of removable restorations.\" - the remaining respondents are not clearly categorized by their responses. - in 2018: - the \"no\" response slightly decreased to 6%. - the \"more fixed instead of removable restorations\" category remained at 69%. - the \"not related\" or \"neutral\" statuses increased, with 25% falling under these categories. 4. **mean values**: - there is a notable rise in the percentage of those considering their responses as \"neutral\" or \"not related,\" from 2.8% in 2015 to 25% in 2018. - the percentage who indicated \"more fixed instead of removable restorations\" increased from 2.8% in 2015 to 3.8% in 2018. 5. **specific observations**: - \"more fixed instead of removable restorations\" shows a consistent increase year-on-year, reinforcing the belief in its relevance. - the \"not related\" and \"neutral\" categories surge indicates growing uncertainty or a broader perspective on the impact of digital technology on restorations. - despite an overall decline in those categorizing the difference as significant or negative (\"no\"), there's a consistent majority in favor of \"more fixed instead of removable restorations.\" 6. **key trends**: - the increasing trend towards \"more fixed instead of removable restorations\" suggests a growing acknowledgment of technological advancements positively impacting dental restoration practices. - the substantial rise in \"not related\" or \"neutral\" responses signals a shift towards a more nuanced understanding of the impact, possibly due to increased awareness and complexity in dental technology and restoration techniques. ### conclusion: in conclusion, the statistical trends evident in the bar graphs highlight a significant positive shift in public perception regarding the impact of digital technology on dental restoration procedures. the categorical data also highlights a broader recognition of complexity and neutrality in assessing this impact post- the image shows a simple line diagram with four spherical nodes connected in sequence by straight-line segments. the nodes and connecting lines are a uniform shade of light blue. each node contains a number written in black: the first node on the left has the number \"3.8\". the second node to the right of the first node contains the number \"3.6\". the third node towards the right of the second node has the number \"3.5\". the fourth and final node on the far right contains the number \"3.4\". the layout suggests a sequential order from left to right, where the numbers indicate a progression or a timeline. the consistent node colors and line style suggest that these representations are meant to convey a sense of uniformity or continuity. the context of this image within the first image appears to be related to data visualizations or statistical information, possibly representing a progression or a sequence of values. this could be used to describe a process or a series of changes or outcomes, though a specific type of data or the exact context is not provided due to the isolated nature of this particular diagram. the image contains a pie chart and a bar graph comparison titled \"scenario: change in the way restorations are performed.\" this illustration provides data regarding the use of digital technology in changing the type of restorations performed. the pie chart on the left visualizes the survey results for a specific year, while the bar graph on the right shows the comparison results for two different years, 2018 and 2015. *pie chart**: the pie chart divides the responses into two main sections: **\"yes\"**: 56%, represented in a blue sector. **\"no\"**: 44%, represented in a grayish-purple sector. the blue sector is almost half of the circle, suggesting that the usage of digital technology for changing the type of restorations performed has seen a significant change with 56% favoring this approach. *bar graph**: the two parallel bar graphs are set against a vertical timeline scale labeled \"mean 2018\" and \"mean 2015\" with respective percentages. **2015**: the bars have the following height indications: - \"more fixed instead of removable restorations\" with a slight decrease, as indicated by the shorter bar at 3.6% for 2015 relative to 2.8%. - \"material used\" with no significant difference, showing slight positive growth from 2.8% in 2015 to 3.4% in 2018. - \"more screw retained instead of cemented\" indicates an increase from 2.8% to 3.5%. - \"more implant supported instead of tooth supported\" shows an increase from 2.4% to 3.4%. the overall \"mean\" for the year 2018 is displayed over these bars, indicating the average across different restorations types used. *data cluster and scores**: the text adjacent to the bar graph details that the scores among the items are clustered based on the relation: **not related**: 10% for both 2015 and 2018. **neutral**: 69% for both 2015 and 2018. **rather related**: 21% for both 2015 and 2018. *notes and annotations**: the lower section of the infographic provides additional context and insights, comparing the respective years. it notes that in comparison to the year 2015, different percentages show slight changes but are overall not statistically significant. most topics saw a higher positive evaluation, with the notable exception of \"materials used.\" *source and sample size**: the infographic notes that the comparison is based on 282 cases (whole sample) for the year 2015 with 138 cases for the year omnivision digital is attributed as the source, emphasizing data validity and usage transparency. overall, the image serves to provide a comprehensive visual representation of the adoption trends and perceived impacts of digital technology on restoration practices over the span of two observed years, highlighting both differences and correlations in usage patterns. the image contains a pie chart illustrating the results of a survey question about whether the use of digital technology changes how restorations are performed. according to the pie chart: 60% of respondents indicated that the use of digital technology indeed changes how restorations are performed. 40% of respondents said that the use of digital technology does not change how restorations are performed. the chart is accompanied by a smaller pie chart with the following data from a previous year (2015): 60% indicated that restorations were performed in the same way. 40% indicated that restorations were not performed in the same way. the overall message appears to be a comparison between the responses from two different years one likely representing the year of the current survey, and the other the previous year. there is also a bar graph comparing \"more fixed instead of removable restorations\" and \"material used\" from another category, possibly showing the impact of digital technology over time on these factors. noteworthy, the data points illustrate that while the percentage of respondents slightly decreases in each year, the responses show a clear shift towards acknowledging changing methods in using digital technology in restoration methods. there are also annotations indicating 'no', 'rather related', and 'fully related' to clarify the nature of the responses.", "type": "Document"}}
