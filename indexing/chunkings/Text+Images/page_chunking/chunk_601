percentage: 31% - text: \"if not, how many laboratories do you cooperate with?\" - this segment illustrates the proportion of respondents who do not have at least one dental technician at their practice, and then proceed to discuss the number of laboratories they cooperate with in external networks. 2. **second segment (light blue)**: - percentage: 37% - text: \"mean: 2.2 external laboratories (vs. 2.0 in 2015)\" - this segment indicates that 37% of the respondents cooperate with external laboratories, and the mean number of external laboratories used is 2.2, which is an increase from the previous year's data of 2.0. 3. **third segment (dark blue)**: - percentage: 32% - text: \"if yes, how many?\" - this segment captures the respondents who answer 'yes' to having at least one dental technician, and it then details the number of dental technicians they employ. 4. **fourth segment (blue)**: - percentage: 14% - text: \"mean: 1.2 dental technicians\" - this segment informs us that 14% of respondents use more than a few dental technicians, with a mean of 1.2 dental technicians per practice that employs one. the overall message conveyed by the pie chart is to illustrate the distribution of dental technicians and laboratories among surveyed respondents, emphasizing both internal and external cooperation aspects. the second image presents a pie chart related to the number of external laboratories with which dental practices in the given study collaborate. this chart specifically addresses the 259 cases surveyed in the study, detailing the distribution of external laboratories these practices partner with. the data is segmented into categories concerning the number of external laboratories: 1 external laboratory 2 or more external laboratories the pie chart is color-coded for ease of understanding, featuring: **dark blue** for practices collaborating with only one external laboratory (32%). **light blue** for practices collaborating with two or more external laboratories (31%). furthermore, the mean number of external laboratories (noted as 2.2 in the studys 2015 data comparison) provides a reference for the distribution observed. also included in the chart is an additional color-coding key at the bottom: **dark blue** represents 1 external laboratory. **light blue** indicates 2 or more external laboratories. **unknown / no answer** with a corresponding gray segment. the chart's key clearly differentiates the collaborated laboratory types, illustrating the preference or requirement for multiple collaborations. in summary, this pie chart provides a visual representation of the external laboratory collaboration practices among dental surgical services, reflecting an increase in partnerships in 2015 as compared to previous years. the distribution highlights a significant portion of practices collaborating with two or more laboratories, indicating a trend towards enhanced collaboration in their process of handling surgeries.", "type": "Document"}}
