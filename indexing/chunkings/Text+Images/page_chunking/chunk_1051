**total sample:** - agree: 37% - disagree: 33% - **sirona:** - agree: 42% - disagree: 31% 2. **cutting edge and innovative:** - **total sample:** - agree: 44% - disagree: 27% - **sirona:** - agree: 49% - disagree: 24% 3. **leading company in the segment:** - **total sample:** - agree: 36% - disagree: 30% - **sirona:** - agree: 41% - disagree: 30% 4. **very trustworthy:** - **total sample:** - agree: 38% - disagree: 20% - **sirona:** - agree: 43% - disagree: 17% 5. **too expensive:** - **total sample:** - agree: 19% - disagree: 32% - **sirona:** - agree: 19% - disagree: 27% ### additional attributes: **recommendable to colleagues:** - **total sample:** - agree: 24% - disagree: 32% - **sirona:** - agree: 26% - disagree: 29% **makes daily practice easier:** - **total sample:** - agree: 16% - disagree: 33% - **sirona:** - agree: 16% - disagree: 33% **customer service oriented:** - **total sample:** - agree: 12% - disagree: 33% - **sirona:** - agree: 11% - disagree: 33% **approachable, friendly:** - **total sample:** - agree: 10% - disagree: 29% - **sirona:** - agree: 11% - disagree: 28% ### scatter plot analysis: the scatter plot positioned to the right correlates the responses about \"sirona\" to the mean response from the total sample. points are plotted across a grid, with the mean represented by a line connecting two key areas: high agreement/high disagreement (top right) low agreement/low disagreement (bottom left) clustered areas: - t = high mean agreement - b = low mean agreement specific data points identify where the responses to questions about \"sirona\" cluster. **completely agree (14%)** - clearly above the average. **rather agree (32%)** - close to the average. **rather disagree (31%)** - just below the average. **completely disagree (12%)** - low mean comparison overall, \"sirona\" is generally viewed positively, with a slight edge showing a higher agreement ratio compared to the total sample average across most surveyed attributes. however, some sentiments like \"too expensive\" and \"customer service orientation\" show lower or comparable alignment with the overall mean responses. in essence, the \"sirona\" brand stands out, particularly in terms of being cutting-edge, innovative, and very trustworthy, yet there is room for improvement, particularly in customer service and the perception of value for price. the image primarily showcases two types of charts, each representing different aspects of brand perception. heres a detailed breakdown of the content: ### title **brand image** ### instructions **how much do you agree the following statements are relevant to the brands that im going to read out to you? please, use a scale where 1 stands for completely disagree and 10 stands for completely agree.** ### total sample **370 quotes** ### sirona performance cluster **154 quotes** ### categories of statements well known brand cutting edge and innovative leading company in the segment very trustworthy too expensive recommendable to colleagues make my daily practice easier customer service oriented approachable, friendly ### charts and graphs 1. **horizontal bar graphs for each statement**: -

**mean for the entire sample:** 8.3 (represented as a red dot), 7.8 (green dot), 7.6 (yellow dot), 7.5 (blue dot), and 6.3 (red dot). - **mean for sirona:** 8.2 (green dot), 8.2 (red dot), 8.2 (yellow dot), and 6.2 (red dot). 2. **clusters description**: - **10% completely agree** - **8-9% rather agree** - **6-7% rather disagree** - **1-5% completely disagree** ### footer **random sample** button linked to a sample data view. the source and page number overall, the image presents a detailed comparative analysis comparing general public perceptions with those of sirona, reflecting their brand image through specific attributes. the image shows a chart that was included in a slide or presentation as part of a brand image analysis. the primary chart is a matrix comparing two different samples (labeled \"total sample\" and \"sirona\") across various perceptions of brand attributes. the horizontal axis lists the different attributes, and the vertical axis splits the responses into five categories: \"completely agree,\" \"rather agree,\" \"rather disagree,\" \"completely disagree,\" and \"dont know, no answer.\" *content analysis of the second image:** 1. **attribute list in horizontal axis:** - well known brand - cutting edge and innovative - leading company in the sector - very trustworthy - too expensive - recommendable to colleagues - make my daily practice easier - customer service oriented - approachable, friendly 2. **responses in vertical axis:** - completely agree (colored in orange) - rather agree (colored in yellow) - rather disagree (colored in cyan) - completely disagree (colored in dark blue) - dont know, no answer (colored in gray) 3. **data visualization:** - the chart employs a dendrogram-like layout with hierarchical clustering based on the proximity of responses. - each sample has its own cluster, and they are represented differently to distinguish the responses. - the color coding and clustering pattern reveal how respondents agree or disagree with the statements. 4. **legend and key information:** - to the right of the chart, there is a legend that helps in interpreting the coded colors and their corresponding opinions. - beneath the chart, there is additional descriptive text explaining the clustering and overall comparison across samples. - the chart includes a note indicating that sirona's performance is quite similar to the overall random sample, providing insight into the similarity in responses. *further interpretation:** each attribute likely represents key qualities or aspects that respondents either agree or disagree with when associating them with sirona. the clustering reveals groupings of responses; for instance, if respondents are clustered closer to the \"completely agree\" and \"rather agree\" nodes, it might suggest a higher perception of those attributes among them. the similarity between the sirona cluster and the total sample cluster suggests general agreement or perceived similarity in the brand image perceptions. the chart is an effective visual tool to compare different sample sets' perceptions of brand attributes, facilitating an analysis of consumer trust, innovation perception, and other pivotal brand characteristics. the image contains a line graph illustrating the mean ratings for various attributes measured by the respondents in the survey. the graph contrasts the total sample with sirona's performance. the vertical axis indicates the mean score, ranging approximately from 6.5 to 8. it lists ten different attributes, with corresponding mean scores represented by points on two lines: one labeled \"total\" representing the overall sample, and the \"sirona\" line specifically showing the performance of sirona. the attributes listed from top to bottom are: will renowned brand cutting edge and innovative leading company in the segment very trustworthy too expensive recommendable to colleagues make my daily practice easier customer service oriented approachable, friendly each attribute has a pair of points on the total and sirona lines, indicating their respective mean scores. key observations include: 1. \"will renowned brand\" and \"leading company in the segment\" have high scores, showing a strong recognition of these attributes. sirona performs similarly to the overall sample. 2. \"cutting edge and innovative\" is rated slightly lower for sirona compared to the total sample, with a noticeable gap. 3. \"trusting\" has one of the highest scores for sirona, showing high levels of trust among the respondents. 4. \"too expensive\" exhibits a significant gap where sirona's performance is lower than the mean scores from the overall sample, indicating a major areas of improvement. 5. \"reduce the number of appointments needed for the desired outcome\" shows a significant score for sirona that is close to the overall sample but might indicate a need for adjustment to meet respondents expectations. the image's primary purpose is to visually summarize the perceptions and satisfaction levels that respondents have of a hypothetical brand referred to as sirona, in comparison to average perceptions of similar brands. this analysis can help sirona understand where it excels and where there is room for enhancement. the image contains a detailed data visualization, specifically a heatmap created by di, illustrating the brand image perceptions of an unnamed company's interaction with its customers based on various statements. the overall layout is clean and divided into two primary sections: the main chart and a legend/key explaining the color scheme used in the visualization. ### main chart 1. **structure**: - the chart is presented in a matrix format with rows and columns. - it is divided into five main rows and five main columns, representing responses to several brand-related statements about the unnamed company. 2. **rows**: - each row represents a response categorization, such as \"well known brand,\" \"cutting edge and innovative,\" etc. 3. **columns**: - each column represents a specific statement about the company, which includes \"leading company in the segment,\" \"very trustworthy,\" \"recommended to colleagues,\" and \"appeals to the senses.\" 4. **colors and labels**: - each cell in the chart contains a percentage value and a color code that corresponds to a set of responses. - the color palette ranges from light to dark shades, indicating the degree of agreement (e.g., darker for higher percentages). 5. **statements**: - **well known brand** (42% agree, 31% disagree) - **cutting edge and innovative** (26% agree, 17% disagree) - **leading company in the segment** (34% agree, 34% disagree) - **very trustworthy** (45% agree, 15% disagree) - **recommended to colleagues** (42% agree, 16% disagree) - **taste appealing** (37% agree, 15% disagree) - **helpful customer service** (26% agree, 16% disagree) - **quality of product/service** (29% agree, 17% disagree) ### legend and key in the bottom right corner, a legend explains the color coding: - light blue: 0% (strongly disagree) - a range of shades including light grey, dark grey, dark blue, and deeper shades representing increasing levels of agreement up to 100%. ### notes the chart has a section labeled as \"total sample (370 quotes)\" indicating the sample size for the dataset. the side bar with an orange line graph shows a visual representation of the average responses, showing an upward trend in agreement percentages. ### additional information there is a text explaining brand image perceptions with a scale from 1 representing \"completely disagree\" to 10 \"completely agree.\" the title is accompanied by a graphic element of the logo labeled \"di (di)\" standing for the organization. in conclusion, the image presents a comprehensive and engaging graphical analysis of the brand image perceptions by breaking down aggregate customer sentiment across multiple dimensions. the heatmap effectively communicates the level of agreement and disagreement with various statements about the brand.", "type": "Document"}}
