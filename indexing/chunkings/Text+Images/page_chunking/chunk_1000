44% (very satisfied) - **3m:** - 37% ( the image contains a horizontal bar graph that visualizes customer satisfaction metrics based on responses given for nine different cad/cam companies. the companies included in the graph are sierra, kavo, and 3m, each represented by bars across a range of metrics. the metric ratings are provided on a scale where 1 corresponds to \"completely not satisfied\" and 10 corresponds to \"completely satisfied,\" along with a specific rating score for each metric. the results are presented in a way that shows the percentage of respondents who were not satisfied, rather satisfied, and very satisfied for each criterion. notably, the graph further delves into customers' experiences by categorizing responses without the \"don't know\" classification. for each company, different sets of attributes or features are evaluated, including \"handiness / ease of use,\" \"accuracy and quality of restorations,\" \"technical support,\" etc., allowing for a detailed comparison of customer perceptions among the brands. the image contains a bar graph with two sets of bars, each representing different data for three entities: sirona, kavo, and 3m. each bar within the sets is divided into two horizontal sections: a lighter shade indicating \"not satisfied\" and a darker shade indicating \"very satisfied.\" 1. **overall pattern:** - the graph is split into three columns, each corresponding to one of the entities (sirona, kavo, and 3m). - within each column, the bars are sorted from top to bottom based on percentages. - the leftmost bars in each column represent the higher satisfaction ratings, while the rightmost bars represent the lower satisfaction ratings. 2. **details by entity:** - **sirona:** - the top bar for sirona is 53%, indicating higher satisfaction. - the bottom bar, indicating \"very satisfied,\" is 4%. - other bars show varied intermediary percentages. - **kavo:** - the top bar here is 50%, also signifying higher satisfaction. - the bottom bar, \"very satisfied,\" is 13%. - this pattern shows a mix of high and moderate satisfaction. - **3m:** - the highest satisfaction rating is 68%. - the lowest, for \"very satisfied,\" is 4%. - several other bars depict varying degrees of satisfaction. 3. **interpretation of bars:** - each bar provides insight into how participants feel about specific aspects of the companies. - for instance, a higher top bar reflects good general perception, while a lower bottom bar might suggest room for improvement in specifics. - the darker and lighter sections reflect the balance between the two sentiments, giving a richer context to the overall satisfaction levels. 4. **satisfaction insights:** - the graph reveals that, broadly speaking, both sirona and kavo have higher overall satisfaction compared to 3m, as indicated by the comparative arrangement of bars. - each individual's perception seems nuanced, showing a range from high to very high satisfaction, implying a comprehensive user experience. the bar graph succinctly provides a comparative satisfaction overview, allowing for quick visual interpretation of consumer perceptions toward these cad-cam companies.", "type": "Document"}}
