these figures should be taken as an indication only. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. trend analysis the numeric distribution is the percentage of clients that mentioned a certain brand. besides the brand distribution, its worthwhile noting the increase in the intention to buy from 2015 to 2018, as it grows from 27% to 38%. base: 148 quotes base: 245 cases clinic the image contains a bar chart that illustrates brand distribution preferences among clients considering the purchase of an intra-oral scanner, chairside cad-cam milling unit, or a 3d printing unit within a two-year period. the chart's title reads \"dentsply sirona,\" \"3shape,\" \"caresream,\" \"3m,\" \"planmecca,\" \"kavo,\" \"align technology,\" \"straumann,\" \"formlabs,\" \"dental wings,\" \"medit,\" \"roland,\" \"dws,\" \"rapidshape,\" \"other,\" and \"don't know / no answer.\" the data represent the percentage of clients mentioning a certain brand. for each brand, several bars show the preference distribution: \"dentsply sirona\" has the highest percentage at 18%. \"3shape\" is the second, showing 16%. \"caresream\" and \"3m\" follow closely with 3% each, as do \"planmecca,\" \"kavo,\" and \"rapidshape.\" \"align technology\" is next at 2%. \"other\" accounts for another 1%. \"don't know / no answer\" is represented by a significant portion at 57%. the chart aims to reflect clients' brand preferences within dental practices, with a particular emphasis on specific dental device manufacturers. in the context of the first image, the bar chart here is shown as part of a slide, with the main portion being its usage in presentation format. another accompanying image presents a trend analysis for 2015 and 2018, showing changes in preference. an accompanying text describes the data as percentage distribution of client brand mentions and highlights the increase in clients considering purchasing by pointing out the rise from 27% to 38% between the two years. it also emphasizes that some preferences may not be statistically relevant to emphasize small differences. the overall layout consists of various elements including a title, a trend graphical representation, the relevant bar chart, and a brief description at the bottom. the image shows a doughnut chart that represents the intentions to purchase a specific product within a set timeframe. the chart is color-coded, with one half shaded in dark gray labeled \"no,\" indicating 62% of respondents do not intend to make the purchase, and the other half labeled \"yes,\" denoting 38% of respondents actively plan to purchase the product. the data presented in this part of the image is a direct continuation from the content highlighted in the first image (image-1), showing a consolidated statistic that focuses only on the \"yes\" percentage. this specific detail is extracted from the larger context provided by the first image, where the intention data is further categorized by various brands. the 38% represented here likely corresponds to combined brand preferences reported in another part of the first image, which lists different brand names along with their individual market shares. the primary focus of this image is to highlight the percentage of individuals intending to achieve a certain objective, in this case, purchasing a specific product within the mentioned timeframe. surrounding the doughnut chart are textual elements providing additional context. at the top, the image inquires at a general level by asking, \"are you willing to purchase an intra-oral scanner, a chairside cad-cam milling unit, or a 3d printing unit within 2 years?\" this question is framed to gather an overall intention to purchase, which is followed by a more specific segmentation for non-owners, detailing what brands are under consideration for purchase. on the left side of the doughnut chart, there is a trend analysis section. this visual appears to be a comparative bar graph showing trends over two different years, 2015 and 2018, indicating an overall increase from 27% to 38% in the intention to buy. the bars in shades of blue show \"yes\" for each year, while the corresponding \"no\" percentages occupy the dark gray portion, highlighting the trend over time. adjacent to the doughnut chart, on the right side, details are provided on brand distribution by listing various brands. the brands listed such as dentsply sirona, 3shape, and carestream represent different market segments. the figures next to each brand indicate the percentage of respondents mentioning that brand when asked about their purchase intentions. this section clarifies that while only 38% of respondents intend to buy a specific product in the context, several brands hold small market shares within that 38%. below the doughnut chart, further explanation is given about the distribution figures. it emphasizes that the lower number of cases necessitates these figures to be treated as indicative rather than statistically significant data. there's also mention of the value in noting the increase in purchasing intention from 2015 to 2018, signifying an overall trend. overall, this image serves as an informative breakdown of purchase intentions within the given sample population, detailing both the trend and specific brand preferences, all under the overarching context of market intentions in buying specific dental equipment. the image contains two bar charts placed side-by-side, each representing an intention to purchase an intra-oral scanner within two years. the bar charts are labeled and depict the data from two different years: 2015 and 2018. **left bar chart (2015)**: - the total bar is divided into two segments: blue for \"yes\" and purple for \"no\". - the \"yes\" segment is labeled with \"27%\" in blue, indicating that 27% of respondents intended to buy within two years in 2015. - the \"no\" segment is labeled with \"73%\" in purple, indicating that 73% of respondents did not intend to buy within two years in 2015. **right bar chart (2018)**: - similar to the 2015 chart, it is divided into a blue segment for \"yes\" and a purple segment for \"no\". - the \"yes\" segment is labeled with \"38%\" in blue, showing that 38% of respondents intended to buy within two years in 2018. - the \"no\" segment is labeled with \"62%\" in purple, reflecting that 62% of respondents did not intend to buy within two years in the overall intention to buy in 2018 increased from 27% to 38%, showing a small upward trend, while the percentage of those without intention to buy decreased marginally from 73% to 62%. both charts use the same color scheme and format, providing consistency in presenting the data. the side-by-side comparison makes it clear that the buying intention showed a slight positive shift over the three-year period from 2015 to 2018.", "type": "Document"}}
