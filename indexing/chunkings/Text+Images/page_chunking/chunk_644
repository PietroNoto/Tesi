(multiple choice) training / education and support are most quoted needs for additional services. dedicated lab support is more often quoted by bigger sized labs (64%) and in general by labs receiving higher than average scan files from clients and those equipped with milling unit (59%). lab-to-doctor education support is more often quoted by labs attributing a high importance to training and education (44%), by those receiving high shares of models/impression works to digitize (48%) and by smaller sized labs (46%). access to restorative design services is more often quoted by labs receiving a higher share of scan files (37%) and those producing a higher number of ortho cases with aligners (37%). access to modelling and interpretation services are more often quoted by labs with higher share of clients sending scan files (34%) and by those performing higher production of ortho cases with aligners (41%). commercial partnership is more often quoted by labs with high share of clients sending scan files (33%) and those less involved in traditional techniques (31%). labo in the uk the issue of dedicated laboratory support and access to restorative design services are the most relevant. in some countries more elements are mentioned, for example in spain and italy both training and support in providing a synergistic training path between laboratory and clinic is very important. in fact, dentists often turn to the laboratory for guidance on digital flow management. base: 594 cases the image contains a bar graph titled \"expected additional support and services\" which indicates the results of a survey regarding the needs of dentists for additional services from digital providers. the graph displays several categories and the percentage of respondents who expect these services. the specific categories and their respective percentages (from the largest to the smallest) are: 1. **training/education for my lab** - 65% 2. **dedicated lab support** - 53% 3. **support with lab-to-doctor education** - 38% 4. **access to restorative design services** - 29% 5. **access to modelling & interpretation services** - 28% 6. **support with lab-to-doctor marketing** - 25% 7. **commercial partnership financ. incent. / commission driven scanner recomm.** - 25% 8. **access to printed models** - 24% 9. **intra-oral scanner rental program** - 20% 10. **access to milled models** - 17% the top three needs are training/education for their lab, dedicated lab support, and support with lab-to-doctor education. below this graph, there's a set of bullet points providing further context and details regarding lab support requirements for different types of labs and the significance of each support area. these details highlight issues of scale, client volume, alignment with model digitalization workflows, and the involvement of aligners. there's also mention of the significance of lab support and the importance of the lab in guiding digital flow management. the specific requirements highlight the emphasis on education, support for different aspects of lab operations, and collaborative financial incentives, particularly in the context of lab-digital relationship and flow management. overall, the graph and the accompanying text present that training, dedicated support, and educational aid are the most crucial needs for labs.", "type": "Document"}}
