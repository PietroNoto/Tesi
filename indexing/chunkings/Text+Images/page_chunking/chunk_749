(scores from 1 completely unsatisfied to 10 completely satisfied) mean overall brands (365 quotes) labo 101 the 10 possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores among the items and the brands evaluated. the clustering is the following: not satisfied: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 1 to rather satisfied: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to very satisfied: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 9 to the image contains a detailed satisfaction score survey data for various categories related to cad-cam (computer-aided computer-aided manufacturing) brands. these are presented in a visual format known as a table. at the top of the table, there are various factors listed that users were asked to evaluate, each corresponding to a satisfaction score (rated from 1 to 10). these factors include: accuracy and overall quality of the restorations reliability wide range of materials available wide range of procedures available makes daily practice easier handiness / ease of use technical assistance in case of repair technical support from the company productivity increase compatibility with other brands company availability and flexibility overall running costs start-up training frequency of sw updates from the company cost of sw updates business development support overall satisfaction to the right of the table, a key illustrating the satisfaction levels is provided. this key clusters the 10 possible answers into three groups: 1. \"not satisfied\": scores from 1 to 6. 2. \"rather satisfied\": scores from 7 to 8. 3. \"very satisfied\": scores from 9 to the body of the table is filled with horizontal bar graphs for each category, representing the mean satisfaction score, which ranges between 4 and each category has three colored segments, indicating the proportions for each satisfaction level. specifically: the largest segment (blue) indicates a \"rather satisfied\" response. the orange segment signifies \"not satisfied.\" the yellow segment indicates a \"very satisfied\" response. below each category, the mean satisfaction score is highlighted in red. for instance: accuracy and overall quality of the restorations: 3.5 reliability: 8 wide range of materials available: 8 wide range of procedures available: 7.5 makes daily practice easier: 7 handiness/ease of use: 6 technical assistance in case of repair: 7.2 technical support from the company: 8 productivity increase: 7.8 compatibility with other brands: 6.5 company availability and flexibility: 7.5 overall running costs: 7.2 start-up training: 8 frequency of sw updates from the company: 7.1 cost of sw updates: 6.5 business development support: 6.5 overall, the visualization in the second image effectively conveys the subjective satisfaction levels across these categories. the mean satisfaction scores also provide a quantified measure that complements the graphical representation, offering a comprehensive understanding of user opinions. the image contains a detailed table depicting customer satisfaction scores from a survey. it is part of a larger presentation focused on determining satisfaction levels with various factors associated with different cad-cam (computer-aided computer-aided manufacturing) brands. the scores range from 1 (completely unsatisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied) and are averaged to provide an overall mean value for each factor. individual scores are color-coded: dark blue for \"very satisfied,\" gray for \"rather satisfied,\" orange for \"not satisfied,\" and pink for \"i can not judge\" or \"data not available.\" on the right-hand side, there's a cluster-based visual representation of these scores illustrating the distribution across different brands. the mean scores for each category are highlighted: accurancy and overall quality of the restorations: mean score 8.7 reliability: mean score 8.4 wide range of materials available: mean score 8.2 wide range of procedures available: mean score 8.2 makes daily practice easier: mean score 8.2 handiness/ease of use: mean score 7.9 technical assistance in case of repair: mean score 7.9 technical support from the company: mean score 7.7 productivity increase: mean score 7.7 compatibility with other brands: mean score 7.6 company availability and flexibility: mean score 7.5 overall running costs: mean score 7.3 start-up training: mean score 7.2 frequency of sw (software) updates from the company: mean score 7.2 cost of sw updates: mean score 6,8 business development support: mean score 7 overall satisfaction: mean score 8.1 notably, the lowest scores are linked to frequency of sw updates and cost of sw updates (mean scores of 7.2 and 6.8, respectively). the highest concentration of better ratings (from 7 to 8) spans across the wide range of procedures available and reliability factors. additionally, the cluster analysis graph segments the scores into three clusters: not satisfied (mean score: 1-6) rather satisfied (mean score: 7-8) very satisfied (mean score: 9-10) this visualization methodically organizes the data to provide a clearer understanding of the varied levels of customer satisfaction across different aspects and brands.", "type": "Document"}}
