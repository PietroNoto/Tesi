base: 227 (respondents who have ios) the market potential of those who already own a quite recent ios should not be overlooked, but price sensitivity is a discriminant factor focusing on prospects who already own scanners (repurchasers), it was observed that over 70% of the sample has made a recent purchase, indicating a strong likelihood of intending to buy additional machines. however, it is important not to overlook the impact of pricing strategies in italy and spain, where aggressive bundling offers (especially in spain) and significant tax incentives (in italy) starting at the end of 2020 have driven prices down significantly (on average, reducing the investment by 50% compared to the supplier's agreed price, with reductions of nearly 90% in southern italy due to a second tax incentive). this trend of paying a very reduced price for scanners in recent years, due to commercial or fiscal reasons, has influenced the price perception, particularly among those who already own scanners, especially if they purchased them recently. this information was gathered to assess potential differences in behavior and evaluations of straumann's scanner value proposition. hence, the purpose of this data analysis is to provide new insights when examining purchase behavior and value propositions. owners only the image contains a pie chart presenting data on the year of purchase for scanners among respondents who have ioss (intraoral scanning systems). key elements and details of the pie chart: 1. **title**: the title of the pie chart is \"year of purchase,\" located at the center of the chart. 2. **legend**: the legend is provided within the circular chart, segmenting the data into four color-coded categories, each representing a different time frame for scanner purchase: - a larger green segment indicating \"recent\" purchase period, marked at 71%. this large portion suggests that most respondents purchased their scanners within a specific recent time frame. - a red segment labeled \"before 2022\", signifying the purchase period between their older investment years and 2022, marked at 29%. 3. **percentage distribution**: - larger segment: green, signifying the majority of respondents have made purchases in a specific recent time frame, showing 71%. - medium segment: red, denoting respondents who made purchases before 2022, amounting to 29%. the pie chart effectively illustrates that a large majority of the respondents belong to the recent purchase category, and a smaller portion falls into the pre-2022 purchase category. this reflects the trends in the market where new purchases are more common compared to older investments. the visual presentation allows for a clear understanding of the proportions among different periods of purchase. the image contains a bar graph title \"country\" which is a portion of a larger infographic. this graph shows a comparison between three countries france, italy, and spain in terms of a specific variable represented by the percentages on the vertical axis, against the horizontal axis which represents different groups within the respective countries. the following details can be noted from the image: three separate bars represent each of the three countries: france, italy, and spain. each bar is segmented into two colors: teal and red. the height of the teal section indicates one percentage ratio, and the height of the red section indicates another percentage ratio. for france, the teal section of the bar rises to 67%, and the red section rises to 33%. for italy, the teal section of the bar rises to 77%, and the red section rises to 23%. for spain, the teal section of the bar rises to 68%, and the red section rises to 32%. none of the information in the image is provided beyond these numerical values and their associated colors. the exact variable or categories that these percentages represent cannot be determined solely from the image. this segmentation and representation of percentages across these countries and groups suggests a comparative analysis, possibly of market shares, purchasing behaviors, or some form of statistical analysis specific to each country. the design of the graph indicates clear differences between the teal and red sections for each of the three countries. the image contains a pie chart titled \"ios ownership\" with two color categories: green and dark gray. the larger dark green segment occupies approximately 61% of the pie, indicating a higher percentage of respondents who own iphones, while the smallest gray segment occupies around 39% of the pie, suggesting a smaller percentage with other types of ownership.", "type": "Document"}}
