11 users (blue circled data, respondents sending their impressions or scan files to a partner lab), 11% of them also send their impressions or scan files to a manufacturer/milling center and 7% of them also have a chairside milling. of course, this is a kind of multiple answer question. also, the same information is available with the technologies in rows, and in the columns there are always both the channels and the technologies. the information can be read as follows: with regard to the technology users, out of the total impression users (red circled data, respondents sending their impressions outside for milling), in 4% of the cases they also use the scanner technology (they use the scanner to produce scan files to be sent outside for milling) and 5% of them also have a chairside milling. on the other hand, with regard to the channel users, out of the total partner lab users (blue circled data, respondents sending their impressions or scan files to a partner lab), in 93% of the cases they send the impressions to a partner lab, in 11% of the cases they send scan files to a partner lab and in 7% of the cases they also have a chairside milling. this is a kind of multiple answer question as well. role of digital technologies in the future chart influence of digital technologies on prosthetics performance europe vs. breakdown per country the predominant feeling is that the digital technologies will be important in the future, however they are not going to completely replace the traditional way. the image contains a bar and pie charts illustrating the influence of digital technologies on prosthetics performance, by country, from the key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015 executive summary. the central portion comprises the pie charts for each country, divided into five categories: **dark blue**: they will play an important role but i feel the traditional prosthetics will continue to be relevant in the future. **light blue**: digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics. **green**: digital technologies will affect a limited part of the prosthetics. **gray**: they will not be important. **yellow**: don't know. each country has a unique distribution of these categories: 1. **germany (de)**: - 59%: digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics. - 17%: they will not play an important role. - 12%: digital technologies will affect a limited part. - 13%: they will play an important role but i feel the traditional aspects will be relevant. - 2%: don't know. 2. **france (fr)**: - 48%: digital technologies will replace traditional aspects. - 40%: digital technologies will affect a limited part. - 13%: don't know. - 12%: they will play an important role but with a continued relevance to traditional methods. - 7%: digital technologies will replace all traditional prosthetics. 3. **ireland (ir)**: - 51%: digital technologies will play an important role. - 48%: digital technologies will replace most traditional aspects, though not completely. - 12%: they will not play an important role. - 25%: digital technologies will affect a limited part. - 5%: don't know. 4. **spain (st)**: - 45%: digital technologies will replace traditional aspects. - 43%: digital technologies will affect a limited part. - 51%: digital technologies will play an important role but with continued relevance to traditional methods. - 7%: they will not be important. - 10%: don't know. 5. **uk (uk)**: - 71%: digital technologies are perceived to replace much of traditional prosthetics. - 45%: digital technologies will affect limited parts. - 49%: digital technologies will replace most traditional prosthetics. - 14%: they will play an important role but with a continued relevance to traditional methods. - 9%: don't know. each country pie chart conveys the specific percentage of respondents perceptions of the future roles of digital technologies in prosthetics. the accompanying central pie chart (top right of first image) represents: 54%: only traditional prosthetics. 31%: digital technologies replacing traditional completely. 11%: digital technologies affect limited parts. 5%: no important role. 1%: don't know. the image contains two primary elements: 1. **text and graphs/bar charts**: - there are several columns and rows of data represented via bar charts that depict responses or data related to prosthetic technology use and preferences. - the top half of the text section above the bar charts discusses the breakdown by country of prosthesis performance using digital technologies in europe. - the bottom half, labeled as \"chart influence of digital technologies on prosthetics performance europe vs. breakdown per country\" includes multiple bar charts related to digital technology usage in different contexts. 2. **bar charts**: - each bar chart in the middle section represents different channels, centers, and technologies used for sending data about prosthetics. - **channels and centers**: - **chairside milling** represented by dark blue bars. - **manuf/milling center channel** represented by light blue bars. - **partner lab** represented by dark blue bars. - specific percentages are provided for each combination of technology or channel within the bars, such as \"scanner\" (29%), \"impression\" (13%), and \"chairside milling\" (100%). - percentages next to each bar in the \"partners lab\" row indicate the proportions of data sent by partner labs. 3. **key-values highlighted**: - several important values are highlighted by red oval and circle graphics: - a red circle highlights \"impression technology at 100%\" under \"chairside milling\". - another red circle emphasizes \"partner lab\" at 11%. this layout and detailed graphical presentation provide a precise statistical overview, allowing viewers to understand the specific contributions of various digital technologies and their channels to the overall performance of prosthetics across europe.", "type": "Document"}}
