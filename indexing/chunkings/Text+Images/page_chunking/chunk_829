darker blue: \"the relationship will become tighter because of the highly specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing\" - medium blue: \"the relationship will become blander because the cad processing will be even easier and it does not require specific expertise from the dentist\" - lighter blue: \"the relationship with the industry will become tighter because of the need for case specific manufactured products and services\" - grey: \"don't know\" 2. **x-axis**: this axis marks the different countries surveyed, labeled as de (germany), fr (france), it (italy), sp (spain), and uk (united kingdom). 3. **y-axis**: the bars themselves represent the percentage of respondents. y-axis values range from 0% to 50%, though specific intervals are not labeled. 4. **data representation**: each country has three bars representing the three categories: - germany (de): light blue (29%), medium blue (25%), darker blue (25%) - france (fr): light blue (28%), medium blue (32%), darker blue (31%) - italy (it): light blue (31%), medium blue (36%), darker blue (25%) - spain (sp): light blue (39%), medium blue (20%), darker blue (34%) - united kingdom (uk): light blue (25%), medium blue (25%), darker blue (57%) 5. **detailed description by country and category**: - **germany (de)**: there is a balanced distribution among the categories, with 25% of respondents thinking the relationship with the industry will tighten, 29% thinking it will become tighter due to technician specialization, and 25% indicating it will become blander. - **france (fr)**: reflects a shift, with 31% believing the relationship will tighten, 32% indicating blandering due to cad processing not requiring dental expertise, and the lowest proportion of 28% for industry tightening by demand for specialized products and services. - **italy (it)**: another balanced representation, with 25% expecting tightening, 36% blandering due to cad processing, and 25% for industry tightening. - **spain (sp)**: shows an initial inclination toward 39% for industry tightening, followed by 20% blandering, and 34% expecting tightening due to technician specialization. - **united kingdom (uk)**: has an interesting distribution, showing 57% belief in industry tightening, 25% for technician specialization tightening, and equally lower proportion (25%) on blandering because of cad processing. the graph allows for cross-comparison among different national responses and reflections regarding the impact of new digital technologies on dental industry dynamics. the percentages highlight varying degrees of trust, expertise, and adaptability across these countries toward the anticipated changes in professional and industry relationships. the second image is a list of responses extracted from the pie chart and bar graph in the first image. it details how respondents in different countries perceive the changes in the relationship among dentists, technicians, and the industry following the introduction of new digital technologies. ### detail description of the second image: *title:** the relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing the relationship will become blander because the cad processing will be even easier and it does not require specific expertise from the dentists the relationship with the industry will become tighter because of the need for case specific manufactured products and services *responses:** the image outlines the distribution of responses across four categories: 1. **\"the relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing\":** - germany: 39% - france: 28% - italy: 36% - uk: 47% 2. **\"the relationship will become blander because the cad processing will be even easier and it does not require specific expertise from the dentists\":** - germany: 4% - france: 28% - italy: 40% - uk: 44% 3. **\"the relationship with the industry will become tighter because of the need for case specific manufactured products and services\":** - germany: 4% - france: 28% - italy: 36% - uk: 40% 4. **\"don't know\":** the percentage of respondents indicating they don't know falls across all countries: - germany: 25% - france: 39% - italy: 34% - uk: 25% ### additional notes: there is a variation in the percentage of respondents across different countries. for instance, in germany, 39% believe the relationship will become tighter due to technician specialization, but 25% aren't sure. in the uk, 47% anticipate a tighter relationship with the industry attributed to the need for case-specific products, and 44% expect a blander relationship due to the ease of cad. france shows the highest percentage of 'don't know' responses at 39%, indicating more uncertainty compared to germany, italy, and the uk. this summarized image enables a clear understanding of how each country's respondents perceive the future dynamics among dentists, technicians, and the industry, shaping insights into regional perspectives on industry evolution.", "type": "Document"}}
