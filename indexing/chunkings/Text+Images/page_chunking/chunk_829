neutral: 8% - rather not important: 2% - not important at all: 21% - rather important: 40% - very important: 39% **france**: the importance ratings are: - neutral: 3% - rather not important: 7% - not important at all: 9% - rather important: 34% - very important: 45% **italy**: the importance ratings are: - neutral: 2% - rather not important: 3% - not important at all: 9% - rather important: 21% - very important: 46% **uk**: the importance ratings are: - neutral: 2% - rather not important: 3% - not important at all: 7% - rather important: 31% - very important: 46% #### graph 2: \"what impact do you feel the acceptance of the ios scans has had on your dental laboratory business?\" similar to the first graph, this graph details responses across the same four countries on the perceived impact of accepting ios scans on dental laboratories. these ratings are categorized as: 1. **no major impact**: represented by a light grey bar. 2. **negative impact**: represented by a dark grey bar. 3. **overall positive impact**: represented by light blue bar. **germany**: - no major impact: 66% - negative impact: 32% - overall positive impact: 2% **france**: - no major impact: 63% - negative impact: 31% - overall positive impact: 6% **italy**: - no major impact: 66% - negative impact: 9% - overall positive impact: 25% **uk**: - no major impact: 68% - negative impact: 28% - overall positive impact: 4% #### graph 3: \"would you be interested in increasing the % of intraoral scans received vs. analog impressions in your lab?\" the final graph focuses on the interest in increasing intraoral scans and the decline of analog impressions. it is categorized into two categories: 1. **no interest**: represented by a dark grey bar. 2. **yes, i'm interested**: represented by a light blue bar. **germany**: - no interest: 34% - yes, i'm interested: 66% **france**: - no interest: 43% - yes, i'm interested: 57% **italy**: - no interest: 41% - yes, i'm interested: 59% **uk**: - no interest: 45% - yes, i'm interested: 55% ### summary insights 1. **germany** has a mixed view on digitalization, with a strong focus on \"rather important\" at 40%. - digital impact: majority sees no major impact, though 32% feel a negative impact and only 2% see a positive impact, indicating a need for more awareness and adaptation. 2. **france** shows a predominantly high interest in digitalization, with 45% considering digitization \"very important\". - digital impact: similar trend as germany, with 63% seeing no major impact and 31% a negative impact. 3. **italy** aligns with france, showing high importance, though slightly less acceptance of positive impacts than france. - digital impact: 66% no impact and 9% negative, reflecting a balanced view. 4. **uk** displays a strong inclination towards digitalization, closely mirroring the pattern in france and germany by reflecting a similar distribution and perception. - digital impact: 68% no major impact and 28% negative, also leaning towards more acceptance. in the image contains a pie chart and its accompanying legend, both presented within the first image. this pie chart, labeled simply as \"image-2,\" details the responses given by 594 dental laboratory cases regarding the importance of digitization within their context. the segments of the pie chart are categorized into 5 different categories, each represented by distinct colors and percentages: 1. **very important**: 34% (light blue) this segment indicates that a significant portion of the dental labs consider digitization to be extremely important. 2. **rather important**: 52% (very dark blue) a majority of labs emphasize the importance of digitization but find it not as critical as'very important.' 3. **neutral**: 11% (yellow) this smaller segment suggests that a modest portion of respondents view digital advances as neither significantly important nor unimportant, maintaining an indifferent stance. 4. **rather not important**: 3% (light green) a minor portion of labs sees digitization as unimportant. 5. **not important at all**: 3% (red orange) a smaller segment that indicates that for a few, digitization in dental labs does not at all matter. the legend is placed at the bottom of the image, providing clear labels for each segment of the pie chart. this pie chart, when viewed in the context of image-1 (the entire page), complements the accompanying textual data, which offers deeper insights into why these percentages are formed. the textual analysis in image-1 provides context, such as linking the importance ratings in each country (germany, france, italy, spain, uk) and explaining the overall digitization trends, the role of training and education, and the acceptance of digital orthopedic scanning (ios) by dental labs. together, image-1 and image-2 offer a comprehensive overview of digitalization importance within dental labs. the image contains a pie chart that analyzes the impact of digitization in the dental lab context. the chart is divided into three colored segments with corresponding percentage labels and titles. the largest segment is colored in blue and represents \"overall positive impact,\" comprising 66% of the pie chart. this segment suggests that a majority of respondents view the acceptance of ioi scans (with implications for digitization) as having a positive effect on their dental laboratory business. the second-largest segment is colored in orange and represents \"negative impact,\" making up 30% of the chart. this portion suggests that a significant minority of respondents believe that the ioi scans have had an adverse effect on their dental lab business. the smallest segment, colored in gray, represents \"no major impact,\" which comprises 4% of the pie chart. this portion of the respondents do not perceive a significant change in their dental lab business due to ioi scans. these three categories provide a comprehensive view of how dental lab professionals in the surveyed region perceive the impact of digital technologies on their industry, with a clear majority experiencing a positive change or no significant impact. the image contains a chart with the title \"what impact do you feel the acceptance of the ios scans has had on your dental laboratory business?\" the chart compares the responses from different countries regarding the impact of the acceptance of ios scans on dental laboratory businesses: **germany**: 66% feel a positive impact, 2% a negative impact, and 32% no major impact. **france**: 63% feel a positive impact, 5% a negative impact, and 31% no major impact. **italy**: 71% feel a positive impact, 4% a negative impact, and 25% no major impact. **spain**: 62% feel a positive impact, 4% a negative impact, and 35% no major impact. **uk**: 68% feel a positive impact, 4% a negative impact, and 28% no major impact. the chart uses a combination of dark blue and light gray bars to visually represent the percentage of respondents from each country. dark blue bars correspond to respondents who feel a positive impact, light gray to those with a negative impact, and beige to the respondents who perceive no major impact. the analysis in the first image suggests that the acceptance of ios scans generally has had a positive impact on dental laboratories across all the surveyed countries. however, there are some noticeable differences in the degree of positive impacts and the proportion of respondents in each country. for instance, italian respondents feel the most positive impact, while german respondents feel less positive compared to other countries. additionally, it notes that smaller labs tend to show a lower-than-average positive impact and those performing a higher number of simple fixed prosthesis cases seem to have received more positive impacts compared to labs performing fewer of those cases.", "type": "Document"}}
