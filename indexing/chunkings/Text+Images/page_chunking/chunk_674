channels 84 base: 417 cases (digital restorations providers) percentage of laboratories among those who provide milled frameworks produced with the cad-cam technique, 50% send scans or models to other laboratories (partner-lab), while 49% send scans or models to one or more manufacturers or milling centers (manufacturer). since laboratories may use different technologies and channels, the sum of percentages is higher than 100%. labo the image contains a bar graph titled \"digital technology use: breakdown by channel\" and shows the percentage of digital technology usage across different channels within the context of cad-cam systems. this is an infographic slide from a presentation and is marked with page number 84 at the bottom. the bar graph is divided into five channels: 1. \"milled in-house\" - represented by a dark pink bar on the left with percentages. 2. \"scans sent to partner labs\" - represented by a lighter pink bar in the middle with 20%, indicating that scans from in-house fabrication are sent to these labs for additional processing. 3. \"scans sent to manufacturers / milling centers\" - the tallest dark pink bar with 39%, showing that a majority of scans are sent to manufacturers or milling centers for further operations. 4. \"plaster models sent to partner labs\" - another middle-sized pink bar indicating that 32% of plaster models are sent to partner labs for refinement. 5. \"plaster models sent to manufacturers / milling centers\" - the smallest bar with 13%, suggesting that fewer plaster models are sent directly to manufacturers or milling centers. to the right of the bar graph, there is an explanatory text providing additional context: it states that since laboratories might use different technologies and channels, the combined percentage of distribution can be greater than 100%. it also specifies that of the laboratories that produced milled frameworks with cad-cam technique, 50% sent scans or models to other laboratories (partner lab). additionally, 49% sent scans or models to one or more manufacturers or milling centers. the image references 417 cases (digital restorations providers) as the base for the data. the top left corner shows the branding of the company \"omnivision digital.\" the rest of the slide contains watermarks or logos of the company \"labo\" and \"key-stone,\" indicating the collaborative or presenting nature of the data presentation. the image contains a simplified graphical representation detailing the usage percentages of different supply channels for cad-cam system elements. the overall content of this image is abstracted and condensed into two main elements: 1. **bar graph representation**: - the image prominently features a horizontal bar graph with three categories: - \"milled in-house\", which has the smallest bar at 26%. - \"partner-lab (scans or plaster models)\", represented by the middle bar, marked at 50%. - \"manufacturer (scans or plaster models)\", depicted by the largest bar, placed at 49%. - each bar is colored pink, and above each bar, there is a label and corresponding percentage. 2. **legend and context**: - the legend is placed adjacent to the bars, clearly marking each category with appropriate labels and percentages. - at the bottom left, there is a source indication, \"omnivision digital\". - additional contextual information is included to the right side. it details the overall percentage sum of the bars exceeding 100%, explaining the necessity for a breakdown of elements such as scans and models being sent to partner labs or manufacturers. - there is also a mention of a base of 417 cases for digital restorations providers, giving a broader context to the statistics. 3. **simplified version**: - the simplified and abstracted version on the right replicates the essential information but presents it in a more minimalistic format. there are no additional texts or logos, and only the bar graph data is retained with corresponding percentages for comparative clarity. 4. **visual style**: - the design is clean and uncluttered with a uniform color scheme of pink and white, ensuring ease of reading and immediate understanding of the data presented. 5. **focus**: - the main focus remains on the percentage distribution, making it straightforward for viewers to grasp the primary usage channels for cad-cam systems. this image effectively condenses large quantitative information into highly accessible, easily understandable visual data representations, ideal for quick reference and detailed comprehension.", "type": "Document"}}
