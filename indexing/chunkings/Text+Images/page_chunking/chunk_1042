kerr in your opinion, how do you rate the mentioned brands in the following areas? 56 mean kerr (108 quotes) (scores: 1 totally irrelevant, 2 partially irrelevant, 3 neutral, 4 quite relevant, 5 totally relevant) all brands (1.142 quotes) the image contains a brand equity analysis chart focusing specifically on kerr. the chart uses a color-coded bar graph with multiple layers to compare different attributes rated by all brands against kerr in terms of their level of customer perception. each row in the chart represents a different attribute and shows the response percentages from two sources - all brands and kerr. at the top, there's a key indicating the level of relevance customers assign to the questions on a scale from \"totally irrelevant\" to \"totally relevant\". scores 1 through 5 represent this range, with neutral (3) located at the center of the spectrum. the attributes listed are: this company has a high reputation. this company has products with the highest quality. this company has a long-time tradition. the products of this company are the easiest to use. i trust this company more than others. i think that it is the right company when i look for innovation. i feel this company to be one of the most customer-oriented ones. i feel this company to be one of the most familiar and friendly one. this company supports my business development more than others. the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio. for each attribute, two sets of percentages are shown: on the left, the first layer represents all brands percentage points for customers' alignment with each attribute. the right side of the bars denotes the percentage points for kerr's alignment with those attributes. key observations include: the majority of attributes seem to have a closer alignment with all brands rather than kerr, as indicated by the larger blue bar and smaller yellow bar. for instance, all brands have a significantly higher percentage in attributes such as \"this company has a high reputation\" (45% for all brands versus 41% for kerr), \"this company has products with the highest quality\" (49% for all brands vs 36% for kerr), and \"this company supports my business development more than others\" (39% for all brands vs 29% for kerr). each attribute row has four color-coded sections: totally irrelevant (red), partially irrelevant (dark yellow), neutral (light yellow), quite relevant (blue), and totally relevant (dark blue). the larger the portion of blue or dark blue, the more customers find the attribute relevant to kerr in comparison to all brands. the table's visualization effectively compares how all brands position themselves and kerr in terms of customer perception across key brand attributes. the chart's clear stratification makes it easy to observe where kerr stands in relation to its competitors in the eyes of the consumer. the image contains a series of text statements formatted in two columns, separated by a divider. each statement represents an aspect of a company's brand image. the text appears repeated or shared in content between the two columns which are labeled \"all brands\" (top left) and \"kerr\" (top right). each statement is followed by a set of colored bars representing different grades of agreementtotally irrelevant to totally relevant, as well as a measure in the middle showing the mean. the following are the statements along with their corresponding response results: this company has a high reputation this company has products with the highest quality this company has a long-time tradition the products of this company are the easiest to use i trust this company more than others i think that it is the right company when i look for innovation i feel this company to be among the most customer-oriented ones i feel this company to be among the most familiar and friendly one this company supports my business development more than others the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio each statement has four colored bars: totally irrelevant (red) partially irrelevant (dark yellow) neutral (yellow) quite relevant (light blue) totally relevant (blue) to the right of each column, there are numerical means indicating the combined score for each attribute, with total responses (1.142 for all brands and 108 for kerr). the purpose of the image is to visually compare the brand image perceptions for two entitiesone under the general category \"all brands\" and the other specifically named \"kerr.\" the design uses a mix of color-coded bars to show the perception levels across various aspects of brand image and highlights the comparison directly on the page. the image displays a color-coded bar chart comparing the brand image and perception of two sets of companies: \"all brands\" and \"kerr.\" the data is segmented into two categories based on the scores given by the respondents, ranging from \"totally irrelevant\" to \"totally relevant.\" the chart includes a series of statements related to brand value and customer perceptions, each rated by the number of responses using the color code. here is a detailed breakdown: ### top row: 1. **\"all brands\" (average of 1.142 quotes)**: - **\"totally irrelevant\"**: 5% (light orange) - **\"partially irrelevant\"**: 13% (light green) - **\"neutral\"**: 37% (blue) - **\"quite relevant\"**: 43% (navy blue) - **\"totally relevant\"**: 47% (dark blue) 2. **\"kerr\" (average of 108 quotes)**: - **\"totally irrelevant\"**: 1% (light orange) - **\"partially irrelevant\"**: 13% (light green) - **\"neutral\"**: 41% (blue) - **\"quite relevant\"**: 49% (navy blue) - **\"totally relevant\"**: 45% (dark blue) ### scores distribution: #### \"all brands\": the brand with the highest perceived relevance is considered \"quite relevant\" because it garners the highest proportion of responses, depicted in navy blue. the most significant majority (47%) of respondents from the \"all brands\" category consider the brand \"totally relevant.\" #### \"kerr\": the brand perceived as being most relevant overall is \"quite relevant,\" indicated by the highest proportion of respondents. the highest segment considering the brand \"totally relevant\" is a slight majority of 45%. ### breakdown per statement: statements like \"this company has a high reputation\", \"this company has products with the highest quality\", and other brand attributes fall between \"neutrally\" irrelevant to \"totally relevant\" in the \"all brands\" category. \"kerr\" sees a more significant concentration in \"quite relevant\", indicating active customer perception. notable percentages such as \"57% total relevance\" for \"this company has a long-time tradition\" and \"51% total relevance\" for \"i think that it is the right company when i look for innovation\". ### mean values: the \"mean\" bar chart shows a visual alignment between the two sets, with higher relevance for \"kerr\" as compared to the overall market average of \"all brands\". ### graphical elements: the bar is divided with precise grid lines denoting the percentage increments, from 0% to 20%, with each step marked at intervals to provide a clear visual distinction. color coding is vital for quick understanding, with each category represented in distinct shades from light to dark, effectively differentiating between \"totally irrelevant\", \"totally relevant\", and the intermediary states. ### conclusion: the chart effectively illustrates that the brand \"kerr\" has a highly positive and relevant brand image in customers' eyes when compared to all brands in the market. the data indicates high levels of perception relating to the relevance and quality of the product, reflecting customer trust and reliance. the visual simplicity of the bar chart ensures it is easily digestible, reinforcing \"kerr\"'s standout position in customer perceptions. the image contains a series of connected nodes, organized in a horizontal line and connected by lines of varying lengths and colors. the nodes are positioned in a sequential order from left to right on a light-colored background. each node is encircled by a bold contour, consisting of alternating light blue and pink colors. the nodes at both the first and last positions, as well as the second and fifth from the left, are filled with light blue, whereas the first, second, fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth from the left are filled with pink. these colors and their arrangement suggest a pattern or a specific visual coding applied to the visualization. inside each node is a numerical value that varies in size and is positioned at the center. starting from the left, the numerical values are as follows: 4.3 (brown) 4.3 (brown) 4.2 (gray) 3.8 (brown) 3.7 (brown) 3.7 (brown) 3.6 (brown) 3.6 (brown) 3.5 (brown) 3.5 (brown) 3.5 (brown) 3.4 (brown) 3.4 (brown) 3.2 (brown) these numerical values seem to represent some form of measured data or data points, perhaps indicating a metric such as performance, relevance, or a quantified evaluation. additionally, the connected lines of varying lengths among the nodes suggest a hierarchical or sequential relationship. the longest line connects the first and the second node, each labeled \"4.3,\" while subsequent lines gradually shorten. the pattern is asymmetric, with shorter lines connecting nodes as the sequence progresses towards the right, indicating a decreasing value or perhaps a reduction in frequency or importance. overall, the image portrays a graphical representation with a focus on numerical values, connected by lines and highlighted by colored boundaries, presenting a sense of sequence, comparison, or progression. the specific data represented within the visual is not provided in the first image document; however, the design implies a systematic comparison or ranking of values associated with each node.", "type": "Document"}}
