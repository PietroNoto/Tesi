41 base: 570 cases total sample still analyzing the practices clusters, we have perceived some other patterns regarding comfort with cad-cam technologies. those with a higher number of consultations per week, specially those with a monthly expenditure with consumables above brl 1,500 feel more comfortable with the technologies. random sample the second image is a smaller pie chart located centrally within the first image, which is a larger page containing various graphics and texts. this pie chart appears to be a simplified and cleaner version of the larger pie chart seen in the first image but is devoid of the additional annotations and context provided on other elements in the first image's layout. the second image, thus, contains the same pie chart data as the one in the first image, representing opinions on cad-cam technologies, specifically focusing on \"intral scanning and chairside milling unit.\" the structure of the second pie chart is as follows: **dark blue segment: 40%** - this segment likely represents the percentage of respondents who feel uncomfortable and quite distant from cad-cam technologies. **light blue segment: 48%** - this segment indicates the proportion of respondents who are approaching these technologies because they see them as part of the future of prosthetics. **green segment: 11%** - this represents participants who are users but do not feel comfortable with the technology. **grey segment: 1%** - this smaller segment shows those who are both users and feel comfortable with these cad-cam technologies. the pie chart in the second image lacks the explanatory text and other graphic elements present on the first page, hence focusing solely on the segmentation of responses. the design is aimed at offering a quick visual representation of the survey results directly without the added contextual details present in the first image. the image shows a bar graph outlining the response of patients to cad-cam technologies, likely introral scanning and chairside milling unit, with a detailed breakdown based on several numerical characteristics. #### overview and labels: **title**: the title at the top of the page is partially visible but reads \"position regarding cad-cam technologies\". **subtitle**: the subtitle reads, \"what is your position regarding cad-cam technologies (particularly, introral scanning and chairside milling unit)?\". **base information**: below the bar graph, there is additional information: - \"base: 570 cases total sample\" - \"random sample\" #### categories on the x-axis: **x-axis**: the x-axis labels are grouped by three main statistical measures and their respective sub-categories: 1. **number of patients per week** - sub-categories: \"up to 30\", \"from 31 to 60\", \"more than 60\" 2. **number of implant surgeries last year** - sub-categories: \"up to 40\", \"more than 40\" 3. **monthly average revenue** - sub-categories: \"up to r$ 9,000\", \"from r$ 9,001 to r$ 17,001\", \"more than r$ 17,001\" 4. **monthly expenditures on consumable materials** - sub-categories: \"up to r$ 1,500\", \"more than r$ 1,500\" #### individual groups: **data representation**: each group has a combination of blue and dark blue bars to visually represent user positions: - **blue bars**: represent im approaching them because they are the future of prosthesis - **dark blue bars**: represent user and i am comfortable with it the chart has the following detailed percentages for each category and sub-category: 1. **number of patients per week** - up to 30: 11% (blue), 49% (dark blue) - from 31 to 60: 7% (blue), 52% (dark blue) - more than 60: 6% (blue), 44% (dark blue) 2. **number of implant surgeries last year** - up to 40: 5% (blue), 54% (dark blue) - more than 40: 2% (blue), 47% (dark blue) 3. **monthly average revenue** - up to r$ 9,000: 2% (blue), 62% (dark blue) - from r$ 9,001 to r$ 17,001: 6% (blue), 35% (dark blue) - more than r$ 17,001: 6% (blue), 49% (dark blue) 4. **monthly expenditures on consumable materials** - up to r$ 1,500: 7% (blue), 51% (dark blue) - more than r$ 1,500: 5% (blue), 46% (dark blue) #### overall analysis: the image conveys how differently respondents perceived cad-cam technologies based on various patient and financial metrics. it reflects a clear inclination towards accepting cad-cam technologies even among segments with higher patient volumes and higher expenditures but relatively lower surgery numbers. this detailed breakdown helps see how usage comfort and approach to cad-cam technologies vary significantly depending on contextual patient and financial factors.", "type": "Document"}}
