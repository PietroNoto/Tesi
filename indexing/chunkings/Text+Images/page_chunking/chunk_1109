**no aligners**: light gray - **up to 20 aligners**: pink - **more than 20 aligners**: dark red **icons**: question mark icon invites engagement on the frequency and preference for aligners. ### contextual information: the data from the visualized survey seems to reflect varying alignment in the adoption of aligner treatment among dental professionals across france, italy, and spain. the disparity might be attributed to differences in regulatory environments, patient needs, economic factors, or training specific to each country. for instance, spain has a higher acceptance of aligners, potentially indicating a better response to minimally invasive treatments. ### conclusion: this detailed analysis showcases a nuanced preference for aligner usage among three european countries with significant percentages favoring and opposing its use. the visual representation aids in quick recognition of trends and makes the data accessible at a glance, enabling informed decisions on dental treatment methodology and alignment care. *the image contains a bar chart titled \"aligners brands\"**, which visually represents the market share of different aligner brands in an unspecified geographical location. the chart is set against the backdrop of a comprehensive analysis related to the dental practices and usage patterns of aligners across various regions. *the specific elements of the bar chart are as follows:** 1. **title and section heading:** - **title:** \"aligners brands\" - **subtitle:** reflects the analysis context from the first image regarding aligners' usage. 2. **bars and percentage labels:** - **align technology:** dominates with 65% market share, depicted by a long red bar. - **ormco:** notable with 14% market share, shown by a shorter red bar. - **dentsply sirona:** accounts for 8%, represented by the third longest bar. - **geo biomax:** matches with 6%, indicated by a short bar. - **straumann:** has a 5% market share, illustrated by another shorter bar. - **unbranded lab:** shares at 3%, indicated by the smallest bar visible among the specified brands. - **biotech dental, quicksmile, angelalign technology, proclinic, and geniova:** each represents 2% and 3% market share respectively, with their bars being the shortest. 3. **chart structure:** - horizontal alignment with bars increasing in length from left to right. - each bars length correlates with its respective brands percentage market share. - the chart includes the brand's name (e.g., \"align technology,\" \"ormco\"), along with the corresponding percentage (e.g., \"65%\", \"14%\") directly adjacent to each bar. 4. **color scheme:** - the bars and percentages are displayed in red, providing visual similarity and uniformity. 5. **surrounding context:** - the chart is positioned next to a pie chart and textual analysis that further complements the quantitative data. - there are mentions of the \"niche market\" and countries of origin for specific aligners such as france (mainly used in orthodontics), italy, and spain. this detailed breakdown of the \"aligners brands\" chart highlights the significant market hierarchy of aligner brands, with a clear dominance of align technology. the associated percentage shares provide a clear picture of the competitive landscape within the dental alignment market.", "type": "Document"}}
