the graph's title, shared by both graphs, appears to discuss the adoption of digital technology in various departments/facilities. 2. **axes and labels:** - **y-axis (vertical):** this axis lists the percentages, ranging from 0% to 57% in increments of 4%. - **x-axis (horizontal):** labeled by categories representing different segments of digital technology adoption: - the \"fresadora 'chairside'\" shows a usage percentage at 4%. - \"laboratorio\" (laboratory) shows usage at 41%. - \"fabricante/centro de fresa\" (manufacturer/frasing center) shows usage at 12%. - \"ning\u00fan proceso digital\" (no digital process) at 57%. 3. **color coding:** - the categories are represented by different colored bars: - green for \"fresadora 'chairside'\" - pink for \"laboratorio\" - light green for \"fabricante/centro de fresa\" - deep purple for \"ning\u00fan proceso digital\" 4. **year comparison (2018 vs. 2015):** - the secondary, smaller bar graph in the right upper corner visually compares the years 2018 and 2015 for the same categorization: - \"fresadora 'chairside'\" at 5% in 2015 and 4% in 2018. - \"laboratorio\" at 41% in both years. - \"fabricante/centro de fresa\" at 12% in 2015 and 16% in 2018. - \"ning\u00fan proceso digital\" shows 57% in both years. 5. **additional text:** - the text emphasizes that the laboratory is the most utilized canal with 41%, followed by the manufacturer/frasing center at 12%, and noting that the chairside fresadera uses less at 4%. - an explanation regarding the difference in +/-2% percentage changes not being statistically significant. 6. **source information:** - both graphs are sourced from case counts (unspecified number). the source and footer information include various entities and statistics data. through the graphical representation, specific percentages highlight the varying degrees of digital technology adaptation across different clinics and departments, with a focus on the stability in certain categories, like the laboratory, and the minor improvements noted for others, particularly the manufacturers/frasing centers. the design integrates comparative visual aids alongside statistical summaries, presenting a detailed overview of digital technology use trends within the healthcare context.", "type": "Document"}}
