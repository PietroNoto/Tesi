7 cooperation with external laboratories chart cooperation with external laboratories - europe vs. breakdown per country uk and spain are the countries that tend to be provided by more than one laboratory. this means that in those countries, the competition between laboratories can be higher or the laboratories are more specialized in certain types of treatments. use of digital technologies in practices indirect restorations performed with digital technologies chart digital technologies offer europe vs. breakdown per country analyzing the use of digital technologies and the european mean (32%), spain, italy and germany seem to be the countries where digital indirect restorations are performed the most. in other hand, in comparison to the european average, where 68% of the dental practices do not offer digital technologies, uk in specific looks to be an important exception, showing some resistance in the use of this kind of technology. at the same time, this topic can be regarded as a relevant development potential of the digital market in those countries. the image contains a pie chart and several bar charts displayed side by side, providing information on \"cooperation with external laboratories\" across different countries within europe, detailed for each lab's cooperation. the data shows the extent to which laboratories in each country work with external entities, measured in terms of the number of labs involved in such collaborations. *pie chart (title: \"cooperation with external laboratories - europe vs. breakdown per country\")**: this pie chart represents the mean for the cooperation scores for each country. the largest portion of the pie, indicating \"1\" collaboration, is colored in dark blue, making up 38% of the total. this suggests that the majority of laboratories surveyed have 1 collaboration. the next largest portion, indicating \"35\" collaborations, is in a lighter blue color. this represents a smaller, but still significant, portion (26%). there's also smaller portions in blue and turquoise indicating three additional levels (1.5, 2.0, 2.4, 2.9) with corresponding percentages (15%, 21%, 28%, 28%, 43%, and 53% of the remaining areas). *bar charts (title: \"cooperation with external laboratories - europe vs. breakdown per country\")**: each bar chart corresponds to one country, showing the specific cooperation numbers with different levels of external collaboration within the country. for example, the bar for \"de\" (germany) contains five bars representing the coefficients (1, 1.5, 2, 2.0, 2.4, 2.9): - the first bar represents 64% cooperation with an external lab (represented by 1), indicated in dark blue. - next is 21% (1.5), indicated in a lighter blue. - another 15% for 2, and 28% for each of 2.0 and 2.4, shown in a lighter turquoise color. - the last, 3 or more labs, is indicated with 53% (2.9), in the darkest turquoise. *breakdown per country**: the second image details the breakdown for each country individually, providing precise numerical data: 1. **de (germany)**: - cooperation with 1 lab: 64% - cooperation with 1.5 labs: 21% - cooperation with 2 labs: 15% - cooperation with 2.0 labs: 15% - cooperation with 2.4 labs: 28% - cooperation with 3 or more labs: 53% 2. **fr (france)**: - cooperation with 1 lab: 26% - cooperation with 1.5 labs: 21% - cooperation with 2 labs: 15% - cooperation with 2.0 labs: 28% - cooperation with 2.4 labs: 43% - cooperation with 3 or more labs: 27% 3. **it (italy)**: - cooperation with 1 lab: 21% - cooperation with 1.5 labs: 15% - cooperation with 2 labs: 15% - cooperation with 2.0 labs: 19% - cooperation with 2.4 labs: 37% - cooperation with 3 or more labs: 22% 4. **es (spain)**: - cooperation with 1 lab: 21% - cooperation with 1.5 labs: 15% - cooperation with 2 labs: 22% - cooperation with 2.0 labs: 25% - cooperation with 2.4 labs: 43% - cooperation with 3 or more labs: 22% 5. **uk (united kingdom)**: - cooperation with 1 lab: 22% - cooperation with 1.5 labs: 15% - cooperation with 2 labs: 27% - cooperation with 2.0 labs: 21% - cooperation with 2.4 labs: 37% - cooperation with 3 or more labs: 22% the second image provides a detailed and granular visualization of the collaboration extent across different levels in france, germany, italy, spain, and the united kingdom. the distribution in the pie chart followed by bar charts offers easy visual comparison at both a mean and individual country level. the comprehensive data allows for insights into the collaborative nature within each lab environment in these european countries. the image contains two sections: graphical charts. the first section is a pie chart at the top labeled \"chart cooperation with external laboratories europe vs. breakdown per country,\" while the second is a bar chart to its right titled \"chart digital technologies offer europe vs. breakdown per country.\" the pie chart shows the level of cooperation with external laboratories within several european countries. it is divided into different segments according to the frequency, ranging from 1 to 3 or more collaborations. the largest segment indicates no collaboration (represented in a darker shade, with 68% for \"no\") while the light blue pie segments represent the percentage for collaboration: 38% for \"1,\" 26% for \"2,\" and 8% for \"3 or more.\" a smaller segment indicates \"don't know, don't answer.\" below the pie chart, a brief textual analysis reveals that countries like the uk and spain are notable for partnering with more than one laboratory, thereby enhancing competition in specialized treatment areas. \"don't know, don't answer\" responses constitute a minor portion of the responses. the bar chart to the right provides a breakdown of the use of digital technologies by dental practices in different european countries, depicting how often digital technologies are utilized for indirect restorations. each bar is divided into two segments with lighter blue for \"yes\" and darker purple for \"no.\" the percentages vary significantly: germany (de) shows a relatively high percentage \"no\" at 77% with a \"yes\" of 23%. italy (it) has \"no\" at 65%, with \"yes\" at 35%. spain (es) follows with \"no\" at 55% and \"yes\" at 45%. france (fr) has \"no\" at 65% and \"yes\" at 35%. united kingdom (uk) has a markedly low \"no\" at 91% with \"yes\" at 9%. the key text below the bar chart analyzes that spain, italy, and germany are among the top adopters of digital indirect restorations, whereas the uk, despite being part of the european mean of 32%, lags behind with significant resistance as indicated by the high \"no\" responses.", "type": "Document"}}
