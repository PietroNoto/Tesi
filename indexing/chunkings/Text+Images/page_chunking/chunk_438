3shape: 14% - exocad: 8% - zirkonzahn & dentply sirona (tied): 7% - roland: 4% - ivoclar vivadent & straumann (tied): 5% - amann girbach & open technologies (tied): 4% - kulzer: 4% - zirkon zahn (repeated): 7% 2. **top of mind**: - 3shape: 8% - exocad: 12% - dentply sirona: 7% - zirkonzahn: 7% - roland: 4% - ivoclar vivadent: 5% - straumann: 5% - amann girbach: 4% - open technologies: 4% - kulzer: 3% - other (repeatedly tied): 7% 3. **prominence index**: - highest prominence is around 0.69. - most brands follow with scores just below each other. - specific values for each brand: - 3shape: 0.69 - exocad: 0.64 - dentply sirona: 0.58 - roland: 0.53 - zirkonzahn: 0.53 - ivoclar vivadent: 0.48 - straumann: 0.46 - amann girbach: 0.45 - open technologies: 0.45 - kulzer: 0.33 4. **don't know / no answer**: - this category occupies a notable portion: 40%. *additional analysis**: the chart provides a visual comparison, showing that brands vary significantly in terms of the brand awareness, mindfulness, and overall prominence among the respondents. higher \"top of mind\" presence doesn't always correlate with higher \"prominence,\" indicating a discrepancy that these measures capture different aspects of brand presence. the data and its graphical representation help understand the awareness, recall, and preference of digital equipment brands within the restoration and prosthesis field. the image contains a line graph that presents data extracted from a survey about the digital equipment brands. specifically, the graph illustrates the \"top of mind\" awareness score for several digital brands over time based on a base of 588 survey cases (the whole sample). the horizontal axis (x-axis) of the line graph represents a sequence of numerical values ranging from 0.41 to 0. the vertical axis (y-axis), although not explicitly labeled with a unit of measure, lists the names of digital equipment brands from highest to lowest in terms of awareness as perceived by respondents. the brands listed include 3shake, exocad, zirkonzahn, and others continuing down to the bottom of the list. each brand is paired with a corresponding red dot that represents the awareness index score. 1) the 3shake brand starts at 0.55 and shows a fluctuating trend over the period, peaking at 0.68 before dipping down again to a low score of 0.41 towards the middle. this trend appears to stabilize with a small upward curve at the end. 2) exocad follows a nearly identical path with minor variations, starting at 0.54 and peaking similarly to 3shake at 0.68 before dipping and ending around 0.41. 3) zirkonzahn's data begins with a slight increase from 0.42, peaking at 0.48, and then falls to 0.41, maintaining a relatively gentle trajectory compared to the previous two brands. 4) there are several other brands listed, each following a similar trend with their unique indices fluctuating between 0.33 to 0.71 at various points. the general trend for most brands seems to depict initial peaks usually around 0.68 or 0.69, followed by drops and variations between 0.41 and 0. some minor brands even exhibit a declining trend throughout, such as open technologies, which starts at 0.33 on the higher end and consistently declines. this array of data points provides insight into how brand awareness is perceived across different responses in the market. the comparison among brands reveals a spectrum within the industry with some brands experiencing higher top-of-mind recall compared to others. the line graph effectively communicates slight yet noticeable shifts in brand awareness over a likely consistent timeframe across the respondents' survey. in sum, this detailed breakdown offers a precise visualization of the dynamics of brand recognition within the specified sample base and illustrates the ebb and flow of digital equipment brand awareness.", "type": "Document"}}
