total destinada a los dentistas. labo the image contains a pie chart with three segments, each representing the distribution of production by technology across different channels. the chart is accompanied by the title \"distribuci\u00f3n de la producci\u00f3n por tecnolog\u00edas: s\u00edntesis.\" below this, there is a brief explanation, asking how different companies use specific technologies in their factory production systems. the base number used for this distribution is 405 cases (cad-cam). the segments of the pie chart are as follows: **green segment (46%)**: labeled \"in-house,\" indicating that 46% of production is done in-house. **black segment (43%)**: labeled \"outside,\" meaning that 43% of the production is carried out by external sources. **brown-green segment (12%)**: labeled \"full outsourcing,\" signifying that 12% of production is fully outsourced to external companies. the bottom section of the image includes two explanatory texts: the first text is in spanish, explaining that currently, precision laboratories internationally realize 43% of all structures in their own plant system, from which a part (16%) is directed to other precision laboratories. this indicates the production pathway to be used for large-scale implementation of the digital fluoro. the second text, also in spanish, addresses that only one laboratory has the total production of the structures realized internationally and distributed to dental clinics and laboratories of precision professionals from its integrated factory systems. it highlights that these structures are destined for production completely distributed to dentists. in this detailed description, we avoid generalizations and focus strictly on the elements present and their specific meanings within the context of the image and related text. the image contains a simple pie chart with three distinct sections, each representing a different distribution of production processes: in-house, escaneados, and full outsourcing. it is labeled with corresponding terms in spanish, each denoted by one of three specified colors: 1. **in-house**: represented by a green section of the pie chart. the portion designated for in-house production does not contain much detailed information about its specifics. 2. **escaneados**: indicated by another green section. this section appears larger than the \"in-house\" but shows further detailed categorization such as \"dirigidas a cl\u00ednicas dentales\" and \"dirigidas a otros laboratorios prot\u00e9sicos,\" suggesting specific distribution details of this type of production. 3. **full outsourcing**: this is represented by a third green section. like \"escaneados,\" it also further details categories like \"dirigidas a cl\u00ednicas dentales\" and \"dirigidas a otros laboratorios prot\u00e9sicos,\" similar to the subcategories under \"escaneados.\u201d this visual clearly segments the overall production process into specific sub-categories, emphasizing how production is not concentrated within one single area, but rather, it is distributed across various facilities that could be different laboratories, clinics, and potentially other specific sectors. each segment uses shades of green to differentiate the various sub-specializations of the production processes from the larger sections, which help in quick visual orientation. the image contains a pie chart titled \"distribuci\u00f3n de la production por tecnolog\u00edas: s\u00edntesis,\" which translates to \"production distribution by technologies: synthesis.\" the pie chart is divided into two categories, indicating the percentage of dental prostheses manufactured through various processes. 1. **main categories:** - **in-house:** represented by the larger segment, this category accounts for 84% of the distribution. the text explains that this large segment covers dental structures produced within the university using their own manufacturing system for dentures. - **full outsourcing:** the smaller segment constituting 16% indicates dental structures that are entirely outsourced to other laboratories for production. 2. **detailed information:** - **in-housing:** the large proportion (84%) signifies the extensive production capacity and internal capability within the university's laboratories. this significant share likely points to the comprehensive infrastructure and self-reliance on internal dental prostheses manufacturing to maintain a controlled quality standard and timely sourcing. - **outsourcing:** the smaller 16% reflects scenarios where the university utilizes external outsourcing to supplement its production capacity. this is useful in cases where specialized equipment or high-demand manufacturing volumes necessitate collaboration with external services to ensure timely access to necessary technologies and materials. the inclusion of detailed notes and labels indicates that the data source base is significant, with 405 cases and cad-cam. key-stone, another highlighted company in the context of the distribution, might suggest their possible involvement or a comparative analysis included, though not explicitly detailed in this visual. overall, the pie chart effectively visually demonstrates the balance between in-house and outsourced production technologies within the dental industry. the image contains simplified data presented in a clear text format without any graphical elements\u2014namely, charts, graphs, or images. however, it appears to be a segment of a larger presentation or document focusing on the distribution of production by technology in the dental labor market. here is the detailed description of the content in the image: 1. **language and layout**: - the text is written in spanish and is structured according to standard bullet-point format for clarity. - the words \"dirigidas a cl\u00ednicas dentales\" are formatted in a standard bold, black font. - below this, \"dirigidas a otros laboratorios prot\u00e9sicos,\" also in bold, indicates the second category of items. 2. **content**: - at the top, it's highlighted with a label or header, which is most likely indicating the section or the major point being discussed. - directly following this header, there are two subcategories detailed using bullets with square icons representing each point. - the first bullet point, \"dirigidas a cl\u00ednicas dentales,\" is accompanied by a visual green square. - the second bullet point, \"dirigidas a otros laboratorios prot\u00e9sicos,\" is similarly denoted with another green square. overall, the image conveys a segment of what looks like an informative overview, possibly within a lengthy document, report, or presentation. it clearly categorizes the distributions into two sectors: dental clinics and other prosthetic laboratories, making it an essential data visual in textual form which could be useful for someone seeking a specific statistical breakdown within a lengthy documentation.", "type": "Document"}}
