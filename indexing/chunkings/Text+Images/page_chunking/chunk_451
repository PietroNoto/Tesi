a pie chart on the left side visually elucidates the participants' perspectives on whether there would be no change in their roles at all due to new digital technologies. - the pie chart is divided into five segments: - \"54%\" in light blue indicates that 54% of respondents believe there will be no change in their dental roles at all. - \"26%\" in darker blue shows that 26% believe that cooperation between dentists and technicians will increase. - \"16%\" darker light blue segment signifies the individuals who think dentists will need to get more expertise about prosthesis. - \"4%\" in white, depicting those who answered 'don't know'. 2. **textual explanation:** - the accompanying text provides an interpretation of the survey data: - the largest percentage, 54%, believes there will be no change in their roles at all due to everyone continuously doing specific roles. - the second largest, 26%, sees increased cooperation between dentists and technicians as technology becomes more integrated. - 16% believes dentists will need to become more expert in prosthesis, suggesting their primary areas of expertise could see more collaboration. 3. **technological categories and expertise:** - adjacent to the pie chart are horizontal bar charts segmenting responses based on different technological fields: - **digit. restaur. provider:** - 16% agree that no change is observed. - 24% agree that cooperation will increase. - 28% believe dentists and technicians should collaborate for better results. - 22% believe dentists need to get more expertise. - 15% are unclear. - **channel:** - 12% believe there will be no change. - 23% agree that there will be increased cooperation. - 19% believe the dentists need to get skilled in prosthesis. - 16% don't know. - **technology:** - 19% believe no change in roles will be observed. - 32% think cooperation between professionals will increase. - 22% believe dental technicians and dentist lab partners need proficiency in prosthesis. - 18% don't know. - **manu/milling center:** - 9% believe their roles will not change. - 29% think their role will evolve with more teamwork. - 13% believe they should specialize more in dental materials. - 14% are uncertain. - **scanning:** - 15% think their roles will remain the same. - 24% foresee more cooperation and collaboration. - 20% believe they need to be more skilled in prosthesis. - 12% are unaware. - **impression:** - 19% anticipate no change. - 33% think that their role will involve more teamwork. - 21% believe they require technical proficiency in materials and prosthesis. - 21% are unclear. - **chairside:** - 16% think no roles are changing. - 33% agree that there will be increased cooperation. - 19% believe the need for specialized expertise in prosthesis and digital material will rise. - 21% don't know. the image effectively juxtaposes quantitative data with explanatory text to portray how professionals view the potential evolution in their roles and responsibilities with emerging digital technologies. each chart's precise data points provide a detailed window into the professionals perceptions and attitudes towards the integration of new technologies, emphasizing collaboration, specialization, and technological expertise. the image contains a horizontal bar chart with the title \"scene: role of dentists and technicians in the future.\" this chart is part of a larger presentation addressing how dentists and technicians anticipate their roles will be affected by the introduction of new digital technologies. the data represents the responses from individuals in the field. *key findings:** 1. **digit. restor. provider (digital restoration provider):** - 52% predict there will not be any change. - 54% predict the cooperation between dentists and technicians will increase. - 26% believe the dentists will need to get more expertise about prosthetics. - 16% are unsure whether the roles will shift. 2. **channel (communication channel):** - 60% predict no change. - 60% anticipate an increase in cooperation between dentists and technicians. - 24% think the dentists will require more expertise in prosthetics. - 15% are unsure. 3. **manuf./milling (manufacturing/milling technologies):** - 60% predict no change. - 57% see an increase in cooperation. - 28% believe dentists will benefit from increased expertise in prosthetics. - 14% are unclear about the changes. 4. **scanner (scanning technologies):** - 70% predict no change. - 22% believe cooperation will rise. - 24% think dentists will need to gain more expertise. - 8% are unsure. 5. **impression (impression technologies):** - 58% believe there will be no change. - 24% expect increased collaboration. - 24% anticipate dentists needing more specialized knowledge. - 15% are uncertain. 6. **chairside (chairside technologies):** - 65% predict no change. - 23% see an increase in cooperation. - 23% think dentists will need to get more expertise. - 12% are unsure. each category is subdivided into four segments, representing different responses to the implications of new technologies: \"no\" (in dark blue), \"yes\" (in light blue), \"partner lab\" (in a darker shade of blue for the middle range), \"manuf./milling center\" (even darker), \"scanner\" (darkest blue), \"impression\" (lightest blue), and \"chairside\" (mid-blue for \"manufacturing/milling\" and \"chairside\" technologies). *additional information:** the base for these statistics is 1000 cases. the pie chart above the chart visually represents the division of opinions more distinctly. all the bars show a significant number of respondents predicting certain aspects will not change, particularly in terms of the \"no\" and \"yes\" responses. the segment predicting an increase in cooperation is consistently around 24% to 60%, with the most significant being in the \"channel\" and \"manufacturing/milling\" sections. experts in \"restoration\" and \"scanning\" are more likely to expect a shift, while \"chairside\" and \"impression\" technologies seem to evoke mixed responses. the image is a thorough overview, showing diverse insights on how professional perspectives merge with technological advancements, emphasizing adaptation, expertise, and cooperation as fundamental areas of consideration.", "type": "Document"}}
