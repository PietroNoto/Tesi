this large segment indicates that a significant portion of dental laboratories provides digital prostheses consistently. **often: 31%** - this segment suggests that a substantial percentage of laboratories uses digital prostheses frequently but not every time. **seldom: 18%** - this smaller segment shows that some laboratories incorporate digital prostheses infrequently. **never: 12%** - the smallest segment reveals that a minor percentage of dental laboratories never utilize digital prostheses. this pie chart's placement and context within the first image, which includes additional statistics and observations related to digital technology adoption in dental laboratories, provide valuable information on the distribution and frequency of laboratories providing digital prostheses. the image contains a pie-chart titled \"do you provide your customers with fixed prosthetics elements produced with digital technologies (also in full outsourcing)?\". the chart displays the responses to this survey question based on sample data from the pie-chart is color-coded, with different segments representing different response percentages and categories, with two prominent categories. 1. **the yes segment** - **description:** this large segment occupies the majority of the pie-chart. - **color:** it is colored blue. - **percentage:** the segment marked \"yes\" is 69%. - **label:** the label inside this blue segment reads \"yes 69%\". 2. **the no segment** - **description:** this smaller segment is located adjacent to the large blue yes segment. - **color:** it is also colored blue, though with a darker hue compared to the yes segment, highlighting it as a separate category. - **percentage:** the segment marked \"no\" is 31%. - **label:** the label inside this darker blue segment reads \"no 31%\". additionally, the first pie-chart includes a bar chart indicating the frequency of laboratories using digital prosthetic technologies, and a further explanation is present which states that the differences below 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. it also mentions cad-cam users, detailing that 1 technician (45%) represents regular, 3 or more technicians (83% representative of served practices), and that there is a notable increase by 53% and 80% respectively in these numbers. in summary, the pie-chart in the second image provides detailed insights into the usage of digital technologies in the production of fixed prosthetics elements, highlighting the predominant acceptance and utilization of such technologies in dental laboratories as of the second image is a pie chart titled \"percentage of laboratories\" that appears at the bottom right of the first image, which is a page containing extensive text and graphics discussing the use of digital technologies in dental laboratories. the second pie chart is divided into two segments of contrasting colors. the larger segment is in blue and labeled \"yes,\" representing 66% of the surveyed laboratories, indicating that these laboratories do use digital technologies. the smaller segment is in purple and labeled \"no,\" representing 34% of the surveyed laboratories, which means that these laboratories do not use digital technologies. the segments are further sub-categorized into additional categories showing regular, often, and seldom usage percentages within those two segments. the textual information in this segment references the results of the survey, providing statistics for a sample size of 588 cases. the chart does not contain any specific subcategories beyond \"yes\" and \"no,\" suggesting a simplification and a direct response style highlighting the dichotomy between using and not using digital technologies in dental laboratories. this image, embedded in a more detailed informational page, emphasizes a high majority of laboratories surveyed are using digital technologies, which serves as a key finding or takeaway point from the document.", "type": "Document"}}
