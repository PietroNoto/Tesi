difference from mean level of satisfaction by brand on the factors resulting from the factor analysis. the displayed values represent the satisfaction level of those factors, with a value ranging from -1 to +1 where 0 represents the overall mean value. for each investigated factor, the horizontal bars represent how much the satisfaction performance differs from the overall mean (vertical axis). the significant differences from the mean are marked with a red circle, so that it is possible to focus on the most interesting topics. with this regard, it is worth to note the higher than average performance of amann girrbach and 3shape regarding the factor performance, while it is significant the below average performance of 3shape in the factor operating costs. 99 the image contains a bar chart titled \"customer satisfaction: factor analysis - difference from mean.\" this specific chart focuses on the \"level of satisfaction by brand on the factors resulting from the factor analysis.\" ### contents: 1. **title and labels:** - **title:** \"customer satisfaction: factor analysis - difference from mean.\" - **category labels:** \"open technologies,\" \"amann girrbrach,\" and \"3shape.\" - **x-axis label:** \"satisfaction level.\" - **y-axis label:** the categories with which the satisfaction levels are measured. 2. **color key and data labels:** - **color legend (top):** - **purple bars:** indicating the \"performance\" metric. - **yellow bars:** indicating the \"support\" metric. - **green bars:** indicating the \"operating costs\" metric. 3. **data representation:** each brand is represented by three bars: one in purple, one in yellow, and one in green, corresponding to the \"performance,\" \"support,\" and \"operating costs\" factors, respectively. 4. **specific observations:** - for \"open technologies\": - the \"performance\" score (purple bar) is at a moderately high level. - the \"support\" score (yellow bar) is at a lower level. - the \"operating costs\" score (green bar) is below the mean. - for \"amann girrbrach\": - the \"performance\" score (purple bar) is fairly balanced, indicating better-than-average performance. - the \"support\" score (yellow bar) is lower, showing a noticeable gap. - the \"operating costs\" score (green bar) is slightly below average. - for \"3shape\": - the \"performance\" score (purple bar) is notably high, significantly higher than the mean. - the \"support\" score (yellow bar) is lower than \"open technologies\" but does not dip as low. - the \"operating costs\" score (green bar) is around the mean level. 5. **annotations:** - red circles have been drawn around selected bars for \"open technologies,\" \"amann girrbrach,\" and \"3shape,\" indicating notable differences from the mean. ### analysis: 1. **comparative breakdown:** - the chart shows the relative strengths and weaknesses of each brand across the factors of \"performance,\" \"support,\" and \"operating costs.\" - \"open technologies\" has a relatively balanced performance, although there are notable gaps in \"support\" and \"operating costs\" performance. - \"amann girrbrach\" has a fairly high \"performance\" score but falls short in both \"support\" and \"operating costs.\" - \"3shape\" excels in \"performance\" and has relatively better \"support,\" but the \"operating costs\" metric is average. 2. **patterns and insights:** - the consistency of brands in certain metrics can help in developing targeted strategies to address weak areas. for instance, \"open technologies\" and \"amann girrbrach\" show lower \"support\" and \"operating costs,\" indicating room for improvement. - \"3shape\"'s strong \"performance\" highlights its potential in customer experience, whereas identifying and improving critical aspects such as \"support\" and \"operating costs\" is essential for sustainable growth. 3. **recommendations:** - for brands like \"open technologies\" and \"amann girrbrach,\" there may be benefits in investing more resources in improving \"support\" and \"operating costs,\" enhancing their scores in these areas by ensuring better customer service and managing costs more effectively. - \"3shape,\" while excelling in \"performance,\" should also keep a balance and invest in improving \"support\" to maintain customer satisfaction levels. by analyzing the above elements, one can gain a deeper understanding of how different brands rank across various customer satisfaction factors, aiding in strategic decision-making and competitive comparisons in the market. the image contains a comparative analysis of three factors: performance, support, and operating costs, visualized using a horizontal bar chart. the chart is simplified and designed with clear, bold labels and colored bars to represent each of the three factors distinctly. three brands are evaluated in this analysis: open technologies, amann girrbach, and 3shape. **open technologies**: the chart indicates that open technologies excels in all three factorsthey have a positive balance in performance, with a slightly lower bar for support, and operating costs being positive but less prominent compared to performance. **amann girrbach**: according to the chart, amann girrbach performs well in both support and operating costs, with support slightly outperforming operating costs. performance is also in the positive range, but a bit lower than support. **3shape**: 3shape demonstrates a generally strong performance in all three areas, with performance and operating costs being on par and support being slightly lower. overall, they balance well across the three factors without any strong outliers. the data suggests a relatively competitive and balanced performance among the three brands analyzed, with no single brand excelling overwhelmingly in a specific factor area. the chart is straightforward, making it easy to quickly compare the brands performance across all three critical areas. the second image, thus, is a detailed and simplified depiction of the data derived from the factor analysis shown on the slide in the first image.", "type": "Document"}}
