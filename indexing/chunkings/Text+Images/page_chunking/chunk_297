(scores: from 0 extremely unlikely to 10 extremely likely) net promoter score (nps) respondents are categorized as either promoters, neutrals, or detractors. for each brand, the nps subtracts the percent share of detractors from the percent share of promoters, to show net impact on word-of- mouth referrals. gc and ivoclar seem to be the most recommendable brands, while dentsply sirona, kulzer and voco show an nps score below the average. the possible answers (from 0 extremely unlikely to 10 extremely likely) have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores among the brands evaluated. the clustering is the following: detractor: scores from 0 to 6 neutral: scores 7 and 8 promoter: scores 9 and 10 88 base: 1.142 quotes mean nps the image contains two bar graphs depicted on the same page, both titled \"loyalty metrics: advocacy and nps.\" the first graph is an expanded version showing a broader range of response percentages, whereas the second graph displays a more focused subset of the data. each bar graph represents a different set of metrics. ### detailed analysis 1. **title and axes**: - both graphs are titled \"loyalty metrics: advocacy and nps.\" - the x-axis represents various response percentages ranging from 0 to 10 in increments of 1, where: - **0** indicates extremely unlikely to recommend to a colleague. - **10** indicates extremely likely to recommend to a colleague. 2. **structure and data representation**: - **first graph (expanded range)**: - there is a broader range of bars, each color-coded to indicate a specific category: detractor (orange), neutral (yellow), and promoter (blue). - each bar represents a company brand; the colors denote the average response categories described by the mean and the net promoter score (nps). - the data includes brands like all brands, 3m, dentsply sirona, ivoclar, gc, kerr, kulzer, ultradent, and voco. - the bar heights depict the percentage of respondents within each category, providing different levels of loyalty. - **second graph (focused range)**: - it shows a subset of companies with a narrower range of scores, primarily focusing on the mean and the nps. - the same color coding system is used here: detractor, neutral, and promoter. - it includes the same companies compared in the first graph but with a simplified view focusing on fewer metrics. 3. **interpretation of data**: - **first graph**: the analysis shows comprehensive data including the range of scores from 0 to 10, allowing for a detailed understanding of customer sentiment. higher bars indicate more customers are within the promoter category, suggesting higher satisfaction and loyalty. - **second graph**: this graph offers a more consolidated view, prioritizing the critical aspects like the mean and the net promoter score (nps) for quick assessment. - **mean (orange)**: scores of 7 and below indicate poorer reception with customers. only a few brands have scores below 7, indicating a low probability of recommendation. - **nps (yellow)**: moderate values near the mid-point suggest variable loyalty. the highest peak on nps around 65 points signifies strong advocate brands. - **promoter (blue)**: scoring from 39 to 59 demonstrates a significant proportion of customer promoters recommending the brand. overall, the second graph highlights the main takeaways of the extensive data provided by the first graph, focusing on clear, high-level metrics to easily evaluate brand loyalty and advocacy effectiveness. the image contains a table extracted from a larger infographic titled \"loyalty metrics: advocacy and nps.\" this table specifically displays the net promoter score (nps) of various dental service brands. the nps data is placed within the larger context of brand advocacy scores, as demonstrated by the color-coded bars representing detractors, neutrals, and promoters based on the likelihood respondents would recommend a brand to a colleague on a scale from 0 (extremely likely) to 10 (extremely unlikely). *table specifics:** 1. **header:** - the table includes the label \"net promoter score (nps)\" for the right column and features the \"mean\" (average score) in the left column aligned horizontally for all brands. 2. **row labels:** - each row corresponds to a dental service brand, ranging from - the brands listed are: - all brands (overall average) - 3m - dentsply sirona - ivoclar - gc - kerr - kulzer - ultradent - voco 3. **nps column:** - the nps scores for the listed brands are as follows: - 80, 48 - -6, 35 - 17, 18 - 30, 27 - -4, 46 - 17, 20 - 18, 21 - 22, 39 - 32, 36 4. **additional information:** - the image explains the classification of respondents: detractors (scores from 0 to 6), neutrals (scores 7 and 8), and promoters (scores 9 and 10). - the image notes that gc and ivoclar seem to be the most reputable (detractor and promoter) brands respectively, while dentsply sirona, kulzer, and voco have lower nps scores than the average. this table provides a quantitative measurement of customer loyalty and satisfaction through net promoter score (nps), indicating how actively likely respondents are to promote these brands to others, providing a straightforward evaluation that can be analyzed within the context of the larger brand advocacy metric data. the image contains a bar chart that represents the net promoter score (nps) for different categories within a brand evaluation. the nps is categorized into three distinct groups: \"detractors,\" \"neutrals,\" and \"promoters.\" the chart is arranged with different segments of bars, each corresponding to the nps percentage for each categorization: promoters (higher nps indicating a high likelihood of being recommended) have the highest nps percentages at 43%, 48%, 55%, and 59%. neutrals (those with neutral perceptions) are shown with moderate percentages of 32%, 30%, 40%, and 37%. detractors (low likelihood of recommendation) have the lowest nps percentages at approximately 32% to 30%. additionally, the bars are color-coded with red representing detractors, green representing promoters, and a mix of both red and green for neutrals. each bar's segmented percentage illustrates a different user's perception of the brand, effectively mapping out their likelihood to recommend the brand. this structured distribution provides a comprehensive overview of the user sentiment and indicates which segments of the customer base are more likely to advocate for the brand versus those who are neutral or unwilling to recommend it.", "type": "Document"}}
