multiple regression analysis 55 its interesting to note how it looks like in the process of the recommendation both factors are almost equally involved and important. only in some clusters like dentsply brand, the nearness seems to have a higher weight in determining the recommendation. multiple regression analysis the regression analysis is a multi-variate statistical technique whose main aim is to find out the existing relationship between a target variable (dependent variable, in our case, the recommendation) and a group of independent variables (each single factor derived from the factor analysis). one of the main focus of the multiple regression is to assess how much part of the dependent variable (recommendation) is explained by the independent variables (corner stone factors of the recommendation which have been previously indicated: nearness, reputation), i.e. how much these factors are influencing the behavior of the dependent one. the image contains a chart consisting of two parts: a pie chart at the top left and a bar chart below it. the chart appears to be a representation of multiple regression analysis findings by the brand image - multiple regression analysis. ### pie chart **color code:** - **blue:** represents \"nearness\" - **red:** represents \"reputation\" **general information:** - the blue section of the pie chart accounts for 53%, and the red section accounts for 47%, demonstrating that the nearness factor has a slightly higher influence compared to reputation. ### bar chart **structure:** - the chart displays seven different brands and their contributions to the two factors: nearness and reputation. **brands and their contributions:** - **sirona:** - **nearness:** 54% - **reputation:** 46% - **kavo:** - **nearness:** 47% - **reputation:** 53% - **planmeca:** - **nearness:** 60% - **reputation:** 40% - **dentspply:** - **nearness:** 71% - **reputation:** 29% - **others:** - **nearness:** 55% - **reputation:** 45% - **3m:** - **nearness:** 53% - **reputation:** 47% - **carestream:** - **nearness:** 57% - **reputation:** 43% **detailed insights:** - dentsply has the highest contribution toward reputation (29%) but is noted as an outlier when comparing all the brands due to its disproportionate focus. the nearness contribution for this brand is a whopping 71%. - other brands exhibit a relatively balanced approach where nearness and reputation are somewhat evenly distributed, although slight variations exist. - the largest nearness contribution is seen in carestream with 57%, and the highest reputation contribution comes from 3m, which is 53%. **commonalities and differences:** - a general trend observed is that nearness appears to be a more important factor for brands than reputation across all entities. - plurality of brands show a significant contribution towards nearness, with the exception of dentsply. overall, this image shows a detailed statistical breakdown of how nearness and reputation factors affect various brands according to multiple regression analysis, highlighting the differential influence of nearness on the studied brands. the image contains a chart titled \"multipleregression analysis\" with a breakdown showcasing the breakdown of brand image components via a pie chart and bar graph. the background page also includes a company logo, a brief explanation of multiple regression analysis, and the keystone logo at the bottom right. 1. **pie chart**: positioned at the top left of the image: - **regions**: splits into two unequal sections: 47% (light blue) for \"nearness,\" and 53% (red) for \"reputation.\" - **legend**: this clarifies that nearness is represented in light blue, and \"reputation\" is in red. 2. **bar graph**: below the pie chart: - contains six horizontal elements, each labeled with a brand name followed by two red and blue bars. - **legend indicators**: each brand in the bar graph has red and blue bars, representingnearness and reputation respectively. - **brand representation**: - **sirona**: 54% red, 46% blue. - **kavo**: 47% red, 53% blue. - **planmeca**: 60% red, 40% blue. - **dentspply**: 71% red, 29% blue. - **others (combined categories)**: 55% red, 45% blue. - **3m**: 47% red, 53% blue. - **carestream**: 43% red, 57% blue. 3. **competing information**: - a small descriptive paragraph below the pie chart explains that the analysis uses multiple regression to understand how factors affecting brand recommendation, namely \"reputation\" and \"nearness,\" interrelate. - observations: noteworthy is the impact on recommendation, with each brand showing differing weights to these factors. - highlight: a specific focus on dentsply, where \"nearness\" seems to have a higher weight in determining recommendations. 4. **page footer**: the image number \"55\" is visible at the bottom left, indicating this is part of a larger document or report. 5. **branding and logos**: - the \"omnivision digital\" logo appears in the bottom left-hand corner. - the keystone logo is present at the bottom right, suggesting the report was prepared or endorsed by this organization. the image demonstrates how various brands position themselves in terms of reputation and nearness, with visual emphasis on the proportions of each factor within a particular recommendation context. additionally, it incorporates structured text for context, maintaining consistency between the visual and descriptive elements in conveying the multiple regression analysis.", "type": "Document"}}
