40 chart overall indirect restorations production with chairside milling unit, breakdown by type of restoration (calculation from number of restorations) - europe in overall, the most often stated kind of productions proved to be inlays and onlays, followed by implant based and traditional crowns. the analysis by country highlights the predominance of the production of inlays in germany and the uk, while france and spain showed a higher than average production of traditional crowns. italy showed a higher than average production of implant based crowns, according to the statements of the respondents. given the low number of cases, the information should be considered an indication only. chart chairside milling production, main used products - europe the image contains two main graphical representations related to a survey on restoration production with chairside milling units in europe. specifically, it details the breakdown of restoration types by the used restorations. the first part of the image, titled \"chart 46\", displays a donut chart that categorizes the various types of indirect restoration production with chairside milling units based on the type of restoration (inlays, onlays, implant based crowns, traditional crowns, veneers, and implant based crowns based on country): inlays predominantly take up 24% of the production, with 7% of it related to german productions. onlays represent 20%, of which 8% is from french productions. implant based crowns, notably a major segment at 37% of the production, have 45% from uk productions. traditional crowns make up 18%, with 22% production in france. veneers are the least represented with 5%. implant based crowns, differentiated by country, make up smaller segments but also signify a significant portion of the market. the right side of the page shows \"chart 47\" which further details chairside milling production, highlighting the main used products in various european countries: in germany (de): predominantly onlays (46%), followed by implant based crowns (31%), and traditional crowns (24%). in french (fr): implant based crowns (27%), onlays (24%), and traditional crowns (24%). in italy (it): implant based crowns (42%), onlays (31%), and traditional crowns (26%). in spain (sp): implant based crowns (31%), onlays (27%), and traditional crowns (22%). in the united kingdom (uk): implant based crowns (44%), onlays (31%), and traditional crowns (24%). all data points are color-coded, with dark green representing implant based crowns (which dominates in the majority of countries), light green representing onlays, and dark brown representing traditional crowns. the bars are grouped horizontally according to the country, and each colored segment represents its respective portion of the total production. the charts collectively emphasize the extensive reliance on specific types of restorations and chairside milling techniques across different european countries, illustrating a clear trend towards more advanced, implant-based restorations in most regions. the image shows a bar chart titled \"chairside milling production, main used products - europe.\" it details the frequency of chairside milling production across different dental products in europe, categorized based on whether production happens \"regularly,\" \"sometimes,\" or \"never.\" key elements to be noted: 1. **gc - cerasmart**: represented by a blue bar, the chart indicates that 10% regularly use it for chairside milling, 19% use it sometimes, and 71% never use it. 2. **3m espe - lava ultimate**: also indicated in blue, with 26% using it regularly, 32% using it sometimes, and 42% never using it. 3. **shofu - block hc**: represented in teal, showing 8% use it regularly, 3% use it sometimes, and 89% never use it. 4. **vita - vita enamic**: shown in another shade of blue, 25% use it regularly, 32% use it sometimes, and 43% never use it. 5. **ivoclar vivadent - ips e.max cad**: present in dark blue, with 42% regularly using it, 30% using it sometimes, and 28% never using it. 6. **ivoclar vivadent ips express cad**: shown in darker blue, 34% use it regularly, 25% use it sometimes, and 41% never use it. 7. **dentsply celaytra**: indicated in lighter blue, the chart shows 12% regular use, 27% sometimes, and 61% never. 8. **vita vita suprinity**: represented in light teal, with 3% using it regularly and 34% using it sometimes, while the majority, 62% never use it. this bar chart highlights the prevalence of chairside milling in producing different dental materials in europe. the use patterns seem to vary greatly between different dental products, with many users relying on chairside milling as a routine practice, while others either do it sparingly or not at all.", "type": "Document"}}
