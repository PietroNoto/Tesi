86.6% of dentists having an intraoral scanner and sending files to external manufacturers. - 4.8% of dentists having an internal milling unit and an intraoral scanner. - 8.6% of dentists having a 3d cad system. - 4.8% of dentists having an intraoral scanner alone. 2. **textual information**: several blocks of text surround the pie chart providing further quantitative and qualitative information about dentists' usage of cad-cam technologies, emphasizing ownership percentages and behavioral trends over varying numbers of chairs in their practices. 3. **bullet points**: below the text, there are bullet points listing conditions such as: - \"i have an intraoral scanner and i send the files to external partner (partner-lab, milling center, cad-cam manufacturer)\" - \"i have an internal milling unit (and an intraoral scanner) and we directly produce indirect restorations\" - \"i send the impressions or models to a provider (partner lab, milling center, cad-cam manufacturer)\" 4. **icons**: adjacent to the bullet points are icons representing different aspects of usage, possibly highlighting procedural steps or methodologies: - a group of people may denote collaboration. - an icon resembling a scanner, perhaps indicating the use of an intraoral scanner. - other icons likely signify different parts of the workflow. 5. **highlighted statements**: specific statements are highlighted for emphasis, giving statistics for instances where dentists have purchased advanced machinery within a certain time frame and the comparison of the percentage of improved management practices amongst the surveyed dentists. 6. **pie chart data**: on the bottom left, it is noted that the overall data base is of 354 cases regarding cad-cam restorations provided by various clinics. 7. **design elements**: the use of contrasting colors (yellow header, blue background) and clear iconography alongside clean, straightforward typography enhances readability and visual appeal. overall, the page provides an informative snapshot of dentistry trends involving cad-cam technologies, detailing the predominant strategies and behaviors of dentists across different practice sizes. it is visually structured to be easily digestible, combining quantitative data with visual elements for better comprehension. the image contains an icon that is part of a larger slide or document. the icon is embedded on an orange background and is composed of several geometric shapes and patterns. at the top, there is a label with a white outline that frames a stylized white representation of a notepad or clipboard. the notepad has horizontal lines depicting writing space and checkboxes on the right side, implying a sense of organization and checklist functionality. below the notepad portion, there are three distinct chevron arrows arranged vertically. these arrows are styled in shades of dark orange to white, indicating ascension or progress, which could suggest advancement or tracking of processes or goals. the entire icon is centered and enclosed within a circle. the use of bold lines and simple shapes gives it a clean, modern, and somewhat minimalist aesthetic. the image contains a pie chart that visually represents the distribution of dental practices based on their approach to cad-cam (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing) technologies. the pie chart is a part of a page that includes extensive text and figures highlighting the use of cad-cam technologies. the pie chart is divided into three segments, each color-coded to represent different methods: the largest segment, shaded in blue-grey, represents practices that utilize an intraoral scanner and send files to external partners such as partner-lab, milling center, or cad-cam manufacturers. this segment comprises 86.6% of the responses. the middle segment, shaded in blue, represents practices with a combination of an internal milling unit and an intraoral scanner that allows for direct restoration production. this segment makes up 4.8% of the responses. the smallest segment, shaded in deeper blue, shows practices that send impressions or models to external providers, including partner lab, milling center, cad-cam manufacturers. this segment makes up 8.6% of the responses. additional descriptive elements: the chart is accompanied by an annotation indicating the key statistics and trends observed among the 354 cases. to the right of the pie chart, there are corresponding percentage values and detailed notes about the different categories. at the bottom of the page, there is a note about the sample size and a disclaimer about the use of specific terms. in the context of image-1: the image integrates various pieces of information to provide comprehensive data: - a pie chart is the primary visual aid showing the predominant use of intraoral scanners with file sharing to external partners. - bulleted points highlight the specific services and providers involved. - additional statistics such as implant productivity rates for practices with intraoral scanners and the comparison of prosthesis production between improved management practices and more traditional practices. the image discusses how different dental practices manage cad-cam technology, indicating the significance of internal versus external manufacturing aspects in dental prostheses production. overall, image-2 is a detailed statistical representation within a larger context of analyzing cad-cam technology adoption and management practices in dental clinics, providing practical insights into their specific needs and resource allocations.", "type": "Document"}}
