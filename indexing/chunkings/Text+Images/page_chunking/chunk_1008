**in-house (for dentists)**: represented in dark green, it shows the in-house production by dentists. - **partner lab scans**: displayed in green, this represents scans produced by partner labs. - **partner lab models**: similarly colored in a lighter green shade, denoting models produced by partner labs. - **manufacturers scans**: indicated in light green, this shows scans produced by manufacturers. - **manufacturers models**: demonstrated in a greenish color, representing models produced by manufacturers. 2. **time span**: the chart is oriented along the y-axis, indicating the years ranging from 2012 to each bar of the chart displays specific percentages corresponding to the production share for each year. 3. **data trends**: the specific percentages indicate the trends over the seven-year period. for instance, the trend from 2012 to 2018 shows a general distribution pattern in the in-house production compared to outsourced production through partner labs and manufacturers. notably, in-house production, especially for scans, shows varying proportions over time, from 27.9% in 2012 to 38.4% in 2018. 4. **notable points**: - the percentage of in-house production significantly rises from 2006 to 2016, possibly indicative of changes in manufacturing capabilities or preferences within the industry. - the share for scans produced externally by manufacturers shows a noticeable decline over the years. - outsourced production by partner labs remains relatively stable, with minor fluctuations. 5. **legend explanation**: the legend at the bottom clearly explains what each color represents, ensuring clarity in understanding the production distribution. 6. **other details**: - there are base and case numbers, denoting reference data, showing the provider count of cad-cam elements. - notably, there is a disclaimer about statistical relevance for differences below +/ 2%. this segment encapsulates the trends within the cad-cam industry over specific years concerning dentistry, detailing where production processes are being controlled in-house versus through partner labs and manufacturers. it provides insights into production preferences and trends within the industry. the image contains a detailed bar chart that visually represents the production share distribution for different categories of cad-cam elements over six years, from 2012 to the chart is segmented into two main parts: 1. **production shares breakdown by partner lab and manufacturer**: - **partner lab scans**: this category represents the percentage share in production of scans provided by partner labs. the values vary between 3.6% (most frequent category in the earlier years) to 17.1% (the highest share observed in specific sub-periods). - **partner lab models**: this category encompasses the share of models produced by partner labs. the highest point is attained around 7.1% in 2013. - **manufacturers scans**: the production share of scans by manufacturers ranges from 8.9% to 22.1%, with the higher end observed in 2016. - **manufacturers models**: this segment shows share values ranging approximately from 4.7% to 11.6%. 2. **in-house production (for dentists)**: this category shows significant production shares for dentists, with the highest observed percentage reaching up to 29.4% in the bars within each year's section represent the cumulative percentage share, indicating the proportion of cad-cam elements produced out of a total number of 415 cases (providers of cad-cam elements). ### additional visuals and text: **trend analysis**: text at the top describes the method of trend analysis, focusing on the production share by channel and technology, highlighting a trend towards increased in-house production. **color coding**: different colors are used for each category to distinguish their respective contributions, with various shades of green, yellow, and dark green representing the proportions more clearly. **key elements**: icons for \"omnivision\" and \"key-stone\" indicate the probable source or affiliations related to the chart's data. overall, this chart effectively portrays how the production and distribution have evolved over the years among partners and manufacturers for cad-cam elements. the bar heights and color distribution are crucial for quick visual analysis of shifts and trends in the production landscape over the provided years.", "type": "Document"}}
