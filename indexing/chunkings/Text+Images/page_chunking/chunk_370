the left side of the image, titled \"total sample (370 quotes),\" lists several statements made by respondents: - well renowned brand - cutting edge and innovative - leading company in the segment - very trustworthy - too expensive - recommendable to colleagues - make my daily practice easier - customer service oriented - approachable, friendly 2. **respondent agreements**: - each statement has a corresponding bar graph illustrating the distribution of responses. the distributions are represented using shades of orange, blue, and gray to indicate the extent of agreement: - orange indicates \"completely agree.\" - blue indicates \"completely disagree.\" - the varying shades and lengths of these bars visually capture the proportion of respondents' agreement or disagreement levels. 3. **comparison between total sample and 3shape**: - a side-by-side comparison at the top right shows the differences in the responses between the \"total sample (370 quotes)\" and \"3shape (55 quotes),\" highlighting notable trends. - for instance, the chart demonstrates that participants with 3sbafie scored \"higher\" than the overall respondents in specific areas like \"customer service oriented\" and \"approachable, friendly.\" 4. **mean score**: - a line graph to the right visualizes the mean scores of the responses across different statements. it uses a dotted line for \"total\" and a solid line for \"3shape.\" - the mean scores are plotted on a scale where \"1\" means \"completely disagree\" and \"5\" means \"completely agree.\" 5. **scoring system**: - clusters are illustrated through different hues, such as red for \"10 completely agree,\" green for \"8-9 rather agree,\" and so forth to show patterns of agreement and disagreement across different statements. the overall design of this visual tool aims to provide an easy-to-understand overview of how two groupsone being a larger sample and the other specifically 3shape (and presumably another smaller group or company)view key statements related to brand perceptions. the image contains a cluster diagram that appears to be part of a larger analytical output, likely related to survey data, as seen in the context of a previous page which discusses brand image metrics. the cluster diagram consists of several circles labeled with numbers and coordinates, connected by lines. each circle, known as a bubble or node, represents a cluster of respondents' responses. the vertical axis of the diagram represents 'mean score' (on a scale with numbers ranging from 6.0 to 8.3), while the horizontal axis represents 'clusters', with numbers indicating different clusters and their respective characteristics. here is a detailed breakdown of the cluster diagram: **clusters and their mean scores**: - **cluster 1:** meant to represent respondents with the lowest mean score, sitting roughly around the value of 6.0. - **cluster 2:** slightly higher mean score, sitting around 7, typically indicating respondents who have a somewhat positive, but not very high, perception of the brand. - **cluster 3:** this cluster is slightly higher at 7.6. - **cluster 4** and **cluster 5**: these clusters are around 7.8, indicating slightly different aspects of brand perception. - **cluster 6**: a higher cluster with a 7.6 score. - **cluster 7**: the next higher cluster, showing a mean score of 7.8. - **cluster 8 (highest cluster)**: scores around 8.1, significantly higher than other clusters, indicating very positive respondent feedback. **connective lines**: - lines connect these bubbles, showing the relationships and comparisons between different clusters of respondents. these lines help in visualizing the transitions and distinctions between different segments based on their scores. **overall impression**: - the overall design and layout indicate a clear differentiation among various groupings of respondents. the cluster arrangement and scoring help in understanding the nuances of the brand image from customers. by examining this cluster diagram, one can infer how differently segments within the population have perceived the brand, highlighting distinct areas of agreement and disagreement on brand attributes. overall, this visualization and analytical interpretation are integral in understanding consumer sentiments and brand loyalty through detailed cluster analysis. the image contains a matrix chart presenting data on the brand image response of a segment of people who know 3shape to a larger sample of the same group of people overall. the chart is set against a white and pale blue background with bold, readable colors for clarity. the y-axis represents different statement categories like \"well renowned brand,\" \"cutting edge and innovative,\" and so on, while the x-axis shows responses in the ranges of \"completely agree,\" \"rather agree,\" \"rather disagree,\" \"completely disagree,\" and \"dont know, no answer.\" for example, under the \"well renowned brand\" category, the percentages indicate that the total sample is more likely to \"completely agree\" at 44%, moderately agree at 37%, moderately disagree at 16%, completely disagree at 7%, and dont know at 0%. meanwhile, the specific 3shape sample shows higher percentages with \"completely agree\" at 37%, \"rather agree\" at 34%, and lower percentages for the other categories. the lines indicate the average responses of both the total and 3shape samples, with colors corresponding to the bars' height of each category. the bottom parts of the image also have a legend to interpret the colors: orange for 'completely agree,' yellow for 'rather agree,' blue for 'rather disagree,' grey for 'completely disagree,' and a light grey for 'dont know, no answer,' with exact percentages for each response on the horizontal axis. additional notes mention high brand perception scores for 3shape with \"customer service oriented\" and \"approachable, friendly\" being significantly more emphasized than the total sample. the image contains a detailed bar chart titled \"brand image\". this chart is designed to represent how much individuals agree or disagree with various statements regarding brands, measured in percentages. below is a detailed breakdown of the depicted data: ### brand image chart details: 1. **total sample** (depicted in shades of blue, white, and orange): - **well known brand**: 37% agree with the statement, 5% agree less, 7% disagree completely. - **cutting edge and innovative**: 44% agree, 7% agree less, 5% disagree completely. - **leading company in the segment**: 56% agree, 8% agree less, 6% disagree completely. - **very trustworthy**: 46% agree, 13% agree less, 3% disagree completely. - **too expensive**: 46% agree, 19% agree less, 14% disagree completely. - **recommendable to colleagues**: 60% agree, 10% agree less, 25% disagree completely. - **make my daily practice easier**: 59% agree, 14% agree less, 26% disagree completely. - **customer service oriented**: 37% agree, 12% agree less, 9% disagree completely. - **approachable, friendly**: 46% agree, 13% agree less, 25% disagree completely. 2. **3shape** (depicted in bars of black, white, and yellow): - **well known brand**: 37% agree, 5% agree less, 7% disagree completely. - **cutting edge and innovative**: 35% agree, 5% agree less, 9% disagree completely. - **leading company in the segment**: 28% agree, 5% agree less, 20% disagree completely. - **very trustworthy**: 40% agree, 12% agree less, 6% disagree completely. - **too expensive**: 31% agree, 16% agree less, 11% disagree completely. - **recommendable to colleagues**: 36% agree, 8% agree less, 19% disagree completely. - **make my daily practice easier**: 31% agree, 12% agree less, 18% disagree completely. - **customer service oriented**: 26% agree, 14% agree less, 17% disagree completely. - **approachable, friendly**: 40% agree, 13% agree less, 11% disagree completely. 3. **mean** (depicted in a line graph towards the right side of the chart): - there is a clear upward trend overall with the 3shape bar consistently being higher than the total sample across all statements. 4. **clusters**: - the clusters segment the data further: - **10 completely agree**: - total: 5% - 3shape: 7% - **6-8 agree**: - total: 18% - 3shape: 31% - **4-6 disagree**: - total: 31% - 3shape: 51% - **1-3 disagree**: - total: 14% - 3shape: 7% ### interpretation: the chart highlights that the 3shape segment generally holds a more positive perception of the brand compared to the total sample across multiple attributes like leading company in the segment and very trustworthy. however, the total sample reports a higher positive perception regarding recommendable to colleagues and customer service oriented. there is a noted consistency where the 3shape group is significantly more agreeable to customer service oriented and approachable, friendly, indicative of positive experiences with the brand's customer service and friendliness. this information could aid in understanding which aspects of the brand's image resonate most positively with the 3shape demographic versus the general sample, helping to tailor marketing and brand strategies accordingly. the image contains an excerpt of a text, likely from a report or a study, specifically focusing on the brand image of a company. this text includes a list of statements that people likely consider when evaluating the brand. the statements given are as follows: well renowned brand cutting edge and innovative leading company in the segment very trustworthy too expensive recommendable to colleagues make my daily practice easier customer service oriented approachable, friendly in the context of the first image, which seems to present a statistical analysis of brand image and attributes, the provided text is a comprehensive list possibly representing common perceptions or metrics concerning a brand, with each point reflecting how consumers perceive the brands aspects. given the appearance of a professional document, the text is part of a structured data presentation, emphasizing how certain attributes like \"trustworthy\" and \"cutting edge\" generally align with positive customer perceptions, as opposed to possibly negative ones such as the brand being \"too expensive.\" additionally, the document is detailed with various statistical elements. on the top left are the logos, \"di\" and \"key-stone,\" which may indicate the creators or sponsors of the data analysis. on the right side of the main text body, there are scatter plots comparing \"total\" with a smaller group identified as \"3shape,\" displaying how these separate groups rate various statements. these plots likely represent the mean rankings or frequency of agreement from surveys associated with different segments, with lines and color coding indicating the variability and distribution of responses. at the lower part of the image, more statistical details are provided, likely showcasing the distribution of responses and the variability in opinions, with mentions like total sample size in response to specific queries.", "type": "Document"}}
