17 2015: 201 cases the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. the perception about the evolution of the role of digital technologies is not changed in comparison to year by deepening the analysis by segments, a significant difference emerges, between digital technologies users and providers of traditional prosthetics. besides this, its interesting to note the high percentage for the statement digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics among the owners of digital equipment. base: 282 cases (whole sample) the image contains a pie chart with three segments, two shades of blue, and a small section of darker blue. the chart has the following percentage values labeled: 46% 51% 2% notably, there is a text note stating, \"the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant.\" this indicates that the analysis aims at focusing on the larger percentage divisions. the pie chart emphasizes a small slice of 2% alongside two larger segments marked at 46% and 51%. it appears to be a sub-section of a larger statistical analysis presented in the first image, which discusses the role of digital technologies in prosthetics and how those technologies will affect the market in different sectors. the image contains a pie chart that represents the perception of the role of digital technologies in the evolution of prosthetics. this chart is smaller and is positioned toward the top center of the larger page, labeled as \"2015: 201 cases\" and is followed by various survey responses related to digital technologies and prosthetics on the same page. the pie chart is divided into two main segments, each representing different percentages. the larger segment, occupying 49% of the pie chart, is colored in a light blue shade, representing respondents who believe digital technologies will play an important role in prosthetics but do not foresee them replacing traditional prosthetics. the smaller segment, in dark blue, represents the 5% of respondents who believe digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics. the chart suggests a broad consensus that digital technology's role remains crucial but more subtler than replacing traditional methods entirely. the image contains a bar chart segmented and presented as the primary visual data component in the accompanying textual analysis titled \"scenario: role of digital technologies on prosthetics in the future.\" the chart's purpose is to present survey responses regarding future perceptions of digital technologies' impact on the prosthetics industry. the data points are categorized across different entities: digital prosthesis providers, digital technology, technology, channel, partner lab, manufacturer center, intra-oral scanner, and chairside milling unit. responses are divided into three categories represented by different colors: blue for those who believe digital technologies will play an important role in the future, dark blue for those who think digital technologies will not play an important role, and light blue for those who suggest digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthesis. the exact percentage breakdown for various entities is detailed as follows: for \"yes, they will play an important role in the future,\" represented in blue: - 41% for digital prosthesis providers - 64% for digital technology - 78% for technology - 64% for channel - 36% for partner lab - 62% for manufacturer center - 78% for intra-oral scanner - 77% for chairside milling unit for \"no, they will not play an important role,\" represented in dark blue: - 2% for digital prosthesis providers - 5% for digital technology - 34% for technology - 3% for channel - 8% for partner lab - 6% for manufacturer center - 22% for intra-oral scanner - 23% for chairside milling unit for \"digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthesis,\" represented in light blue, which shows the same percentage spread as the \"no\" category for \"yes. the percentage bars are consistent in a side-by-side comparison across different roles and segments within the prosthetics industry, highlighting different perspectives and emphasis areas regarding the integration and impact of digital technologies on various aspects from material providers to service providers and unit owners. the graph supports the broader textual analysis by visually segmenting and presenting the insights gathered, facilitating a comparative and detailed overview of the respondents' attitudes.", "type": "Document"}}
