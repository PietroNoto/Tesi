certain elements is not carried out internally (indicated by \"no\" on the pie chart). this pie chart is a segment of a larger page which is divided into several sections, each containing different data relevant to production of various materials and distribution. the specific segment shown in the pie chart comprises of two large parts: 62% marked in light blue for \"yes,\" and 38% marked in dark purple for \"no.\" additionally, the larger page surrounding the pie chart contains several other graphical elements, including another pie chart and a table displaying distribution data, both of which pertain to material distribution in the year the distribution table includes specific numerical values for both \"materiales en bloques\" (26.3) and \"materiales en discos\" (126.3). at the top of the page, the following question is posed: \"\u00bften\u00edendo en cuenta en qu\u00e9 elemento que producen internamente, \u00bfcuentas de los mismos se realizan con materiales en bloques y \u00bfcu\u00e1ntos en discos?\" below this question segment, there are detailed notes and additional descriptive text that provide context and in-depth analysis of the data presented. the second part of the larger image includes another pie chart but not fully visible. it similarly represents various percentages of another categorical data set, relevant to the aforementioned question. it's noteworthy that the layout is organized into a logical and segmented manner, presenting detailed data in a clear and structured format for easy interpretation and analysis. the use of charts, numerical tables, and textual descriptive notes collectively aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the production and distribution scenario under study. the image contains a pie chart titled \"porcentaje de elementos\" (percentage of elements). the chart specifically illustrates the distribution of materials used in the internal production process for a business or organization. the pie chart is divided into two sections, each representing a distinct category: materials used in blocks (\"materiales en bloques\") and materials used in discs (\"materiales en discos\"). the breakdown of percentages is as follows: **si (yes)**: 86% this larger segment occupies the majority of the pie chart, representing that 86% of the elements used in the internal production process are materials used in discs. **no (no)**: 14% this smaller segment shows that 14% of the materials used are in the form of blocks. additionally, adjacent to the pie chart, there is another section of text providing further insight into these percentages. it states: > \"el 79% de los elementos producidos internamente se realizan en discos, frente a un 21% que se elaboran en bloques. tambi\u00e9n los estudios key-stone de sell-out est\u00e1n comprando un progresivo y estructural aumento del mercado de discos y una reacci\u00f3n de lo de los bloques.\" this supplementary text translates to: > \"of the 79% of the internally produced elements that are carried out on discs, there is only a 21% carried out in blocks. the key-stone sell-out studies also indicate an increasing and structural increase in the disc market and a reaction to the blocks.\" this context implies that there is a significant preference in the production process for materials in discs, and the market perceptions, particularly from studies observed by key-stone, are moving more towards discs as well. the pie chart is accompanied by a reference to the data collection base, which is 153 cases, representing one year of data. additionally, the infographic is part of a larger presentation or report and is marked with page number 138 towards the bottom right. overall, the pie chart efficiently communicates the dominance of materials in discs over materials in blocks in the internal production setting. the image contains a pie chart segmenting materials into two categories, with specific percentage values. the larger segment, colored green, represents 79% of the total, labeled \"materiales en discos\" (materials on discs). the smaller segment, in a darker shade of green, comprises the remaining 21%, labeled \"materiales en bloques\" (materials on blocks). the chart indicates a significant difference in the usage of these two types of materials, with almost 80% being used for materials on discs. this specific segmenting and representation are drawn from a larger document, possibly an analysis report or a research document.", "type": "Document"}}
