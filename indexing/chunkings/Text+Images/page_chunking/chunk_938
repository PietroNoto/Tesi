(multiple answer - analysis on: the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks) 39 base: 1000 cases the sample of dental practices shows a rather low percentage of positive responses, as the average is 40% of respondents thinking that 3d printing will bring a reduction in the cost of the restorations. the lowest percentage comes from germany (32%), but france and spain are on the same level. uk and italy are the most positive ones (46% and 54% respectively, of yes answers). the image contains a pie chart with three color-coded slices, each representing a different response category to a survey question. the chart is titled and accompanied by a descriptive text that explains the context of the survey, specifically concerning the expectations of professionals in the dental field about the cost reduction of restorations due to 3d printing using materials compared to cad-cam blocks. the pie chart is divided into three sections, each representing the percentage of survey respondents who agreed with one of the statements: 1. **blue section** (40%): - the blue slice represents respondents who agree that the costs of the restorations will be lower because of the lower price of the materials used compared to cad-cam blocks. 2. **grey section** (15%): - the grey slice represents respondents who are unsure or don't have a clear stance on the question. 3. **dark blue section** (45%): - the dark blue slice indicates respondents who disagree that the costs of restorations will decrease due to lower material prices compared to cad-cam processes. adjacent text explains that the survey sample size is based on 1000 cases and that the results depict various dentistry professionals' perceptions across germany (32%), france (35%), and spain (54%), with the uk and italy being the most positive ones with 46% and 54% respectively. at the bottom of the image, logos are present from \"omnivision digital\" and \"key-stone.\" the image contains a bar chart comparing the respondents' beliefs regarding the cost of restorations in dentistry before and after introducing 3d printing. the chart is divided into two parts: the top half contains data from a sample group of 1000 cases, while the bottom half provides additional data for a different group of dentistry professionals. in the top half, data is presented for four countries: germany (de), france (fr), italy (it), spain (sp), and the united kingdom (uk). the vertical axis represents the percentage of the responses, divided into categories for \"yes,\" \"no,\" and \"don't know.\" the horizontal axis lists the countries. a pie chart on the left side of the image provides a visual summary of the responses in percentages: yes - 40%, no - 45%, and don't know - 15%. for germany (de), 57% of respondents believe that 3d printing will reduce restorations costs, with 32% disagreeing and 11% unsure. france (fr) shows similar statistics: 48% agree, 35% disagree, and 17% unsure. italy (it) has a larger percentage agreeing (54%) compared to those disagreeing (35%), with 11% unsure. spain (sp) indicates the highest proportion of those disagreeing (41%) and 34% unsure, while uk (uk) shows 46% agree, 20% disagree, and 34% unsure. the bottom half of the image repeats the same country-focused bar chart format, but without a pie chart, presenting: germany (32% yes, 57% no, 11% don't know), france (35% yes, 48% no, 17% don't know), italy (54% yes, 35% no, 11% don't know), spain (34% yes, 41% no, 24% don't know), and the uk (46% yes, 34% no, 20% don't know). both parts of the image illustrate different views on how 3d printing will impact the cost of dental restorations, highlighting discrepancies across different professional groups as to whether they believe in cost savings versus increased expenses.", "type": "Document"}}
