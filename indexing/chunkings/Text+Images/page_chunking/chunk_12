13 relationship among dentists, technicians and the industry in the future of digital technologies besides the analysis on the current use and penetration of digital technologies, it is also interesting to investigate how the relationship among dentists, technicians, and the industry will progress and interact in the future, due to the relevant changes that the digital technologies may bring to their daily work. chart change in the relationship among dentists, technicians and the industry europe vs. breakdown per country the major part of the quotes is in the direction of a tighter cooperation between dentists and technicians and also between dentists and the industry, due to the increasing need for specific manufactured products that the industry can provide. the results also show that uk respondents firmly believe in a future strengthening of the relationship between dentists and technicians with 50% of quotes, versus 34% of the total sample. in other hand, the majority of the practices in germany (36% versus the overall average of 24%) believes that the relationship will become blander as they believe the process with cad-cam is easier and do not require a specific knowledge. chart change in the way restorations are performed - europe vs. breakdown per country the image contains a series of bar and pie chart visualizations from the \"key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 13.\" the charts depict trends related to the future relationship between dentists, technicians, and the industry in digital technologies. the charts focus on the perspectives in different european countries: germany (de), france (fr), italy (it), spain (sp), and the united kingdom (uk). *chart 11** presents the changes in the relationship among dentists, technicians, and the industry across europe and the specified countries. each pie chart is segmented into four categories with corresponding percentages indicating responses from those polled: **germany (de)**: - 34% predict the relationship will become tighter. - 24% predict the relationship will become blander. - 36% predict blander cad processing will make the relationship easier. - 7% believe the relationship will become tighter because of specialized knowledge in specific areas. - 25% think the relationship with the industry will become tighter. - 9% predict the relationship will become tighter because of cad-specific knowledge. **france (fr)**: - 33% anticipate a tighter relationship due to specialized knowledge. - 26% believe it will become blander. - 36% predict a tighter relationship because of increased cad processing. - 37% think the relationship will become tighter due to focused knowledge areas. - 10% predict blander relationships are expected. **italy (it)**: - 27% foresee a tighter relationship. - 35% believe it will become blander due to increased cad. - 40% predict the relationship will become tighter. - 16% anticipate it will be blander due to cad knowledge. - 12% predict the relationship will become tighter with cad-focused knowledge. - 4% believe it won't change. **spain (sp)**: - 31% predict a tighter relationship. - 49% assume it will become blander. - 34% perceive it will remain the same due to cad knowledge. - 25% believe it will become tighter with cad knowledge. - 31% predict the relationship will become tighter. - 16% anticipate it will remain the same. **united kingdom (uk)**: - 22% think the relationship will become tighter. - 50% anticipate a blander relationship. - 22% predict it will become tighter due to increased cad knowledge. - 16% anticipate it will remain the same. - 27% predict the relationship will become tighter due to cad knowledge. - 1% predict it will become tighter because of cad-specific knowledge. *chart 12** illustrates changes in the restorations performed using cad-cam technology in the same countries: **germany (de)**: - 79% are performing more restorations. - 21% are performing a moderate number. - 1% are performing fewer restorations. **france (fr)**: - 59% performing more restorations. - 41% performing a moderate number. - 2% performing fewer restorations. **italy (it)**: - 69% performing more restorations. - 31% performing a moderate number. - 1% performing fewer restorations. **spain (sp)**: - 60% performing more restorations. - 40% performing a moderate number. - 1% performing fewer restorations. **united kingdom (uk)**: - 70% performing more restorations. - 40% performing a moderate number. - 1% performing fewer restorations. the charts reflect a general trend where most respondents in all countries expect an increase in the integration and use of digital technology, indicating growth in cad-cam restorations and a predicted shift towards closer cooperation among dentists, technicians, and industry professionals. the image contains a text excerpt from a survey report concerning the relationships between dentists, technicians, and the industry in the context of digital technologies. this excerpt is labeled as \"the relationship among dentists, technicians, and the industry in the future of digital technologies\". the text provides four primary responses, each accompanied by a specific color code. the responses include: 1. **the relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing:** represented in dark blue. 2. **the relationship will become blander because the cad processing will be even easier and it does not require specific expertise from the dentists:** represented in light blue. 3. **the relationship with the industry will become tighter because of the need for case-specific manufactured products and services:** represented in aqua. 4. **dont know:** represented in grey. each category is paired with a corresponding percentage from a survey that presumably indicates the respondents' opinions on the future dynamics between dentists, technicians, and the industry. however, specific percentage values are not mentioned directly in the text excerpt provided. the overall content suggests that the survey was designed to gauge the perception of future collaboration and specialization trends in the dental industry concerning digital technologies. the image conveys that digital advancements and specializations, particularly in cad and prosthetics, are expected to either strengthen or weaken certain relations within the dental field. the image contains four pie charts and four bar charts that are aligned side by side, presenting data about the changing restoration methods in different european countries (germany, france, italy, spain, and the uk). *pie charts:** the first pie chart represents germany (de). in the pie chart, the larger blue section accounts for 47%, while the smaller, purple section represents 53%. the legend indicates that the blue section denotes respondents saying \"yes,\" while the purple section denotes \"no.\" the second pie chart represents france (fr). in this chart, the blue section is significantly larger, representing 79%, and the purple section is 21%. the third pie chart represents italy (it). in this pie chart, the blue section (yes) accounts for 69%, and the purple section (no) accounts for 31%. the fourth pie chart represents spain (sp). here, the blue section is 60%, and the purple section is 40%. the fifth pie chart represents the uk. the blue section is the majority, at 70%, and the purple section indicates 30%. *bar charts:** on the left, aligned with the pie chart for de, there is a bar chart showing corresponding responses from different european countries. the bar for germany indicates the percentage that said \"yes,\" while the corresponding bar for france indicates 59%, and so forth for each country. *general analysis:** germany shows the closest split in responses, with a nearly equal proportion agreeing and disagreeing, at 47% and 53% respectively. france has a larger proportion that agrees on restorative methods, at 79% \"yes\" and only 21% \"no.\" italy is a balanced middle ground, with 69% being in favor and 31% against. spain has a moderate inclination toward agreeing, with 60% \"yes\" and 40% \"no.\" the uk, however, shows a significant preference with the majority (70%) in favor, and much fewer (30%) opposed. *detailed observations:** germany and the uk show close-to-even views, with smaller proportions differing from their respective majorities (53% vs. 70%). france has the strongest agreement with 79%, which is substantially higher than the other countries. the lowest agreement is in germany, which is near equal. in contrast to the countrywise analysis, the bar charts offer a clearer comparative view, highlighting france at 59%, the highest among the bars shown, and the uk at 30%, the lowest. in summation, these visualizations reveal detailed insights into the preferences and opinions regarding restoration methods across these specific european countries.", "type": "Document"}}
