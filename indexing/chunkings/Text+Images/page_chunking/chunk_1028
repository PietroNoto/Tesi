the pie chart is divided into four segments in different colors: - **yellow segment**: 59% - **blue segment**: 39% - **purple segment**: 2% - each segment indicates a percent of the whole. the yellow section is the largest, followed by the blue segment, and the purple segment is the smallest. 2. **financial implications highlight**: - in the section labeled \"there are no significant differences within the socio-demographic sample stratification.\" the pie chart is used to display how this statement can be visually corroborated with the distribution of the pie. the divisions suggest equal or roughly equal distribution among different demographics represented by each color, indicating no significant socio-demographic disparities in responses or distributions within the given sample group. 3. **statement context**: - to the right of the pie chart, there is a clear red and blue financial icon with a downward trending arrow, presumably indicating a potential decline in financial estimates concerning the impact of cad-cam technology on prostheses production. there are accompanying statements: - \"the practices with higher performance and with a monthly expenditure higher than 900 euros estimate that the cad-cam technology will replace completely the traditional prosthesis (69%).\" - \"also regarding the stratification by kind of business management doesnt show relevant statistical differences versus the overall sample average.\" - it suggests that specific segments (those with higher performance and higher expenditure) are more likely to adopt cad-cam technology. the overall pie chart reinforces the distribution of this adoption across different segments of the user population. the combination of the pie chart with the financial statements indicates a specific scenario within the broader sample: that of significant adoption particularly among financially better-off groups using technologically advanced methods. the image contains a circular icon predominantly yellow in color, symbolizing a page indicator or bookmark. the circular shape encompasses three stylized human figures. they are identical, simplifying their representations as basic black silhouettes without distinct facial features or attire. the figures are arranged in a straight line, evenly spaced, occupying the left third of the circle. the background is bright yellow, which creates a stark contrast against the black figures, highlighting their presence prominently. this minimalistic design approach could be associated with various digital health or wellness applications, symbolizing inclusivity and collective representation within the broader context of the page the image is part of. the image contains a minimalist icon that appears on a circular background. the icon is centered within the circle and depicts an abstracted, simplified clipboard that symbolizes document or checklist management. the clipboard icon employs a clear and direct design, featuring a squared clipboard with a line down the middle, presumably to represent the board part of the clipboard, and what appears to be a sheet of paper beneath it. the paper section within the clipboard is accentuated with three checkmarks, aligned horizontally at the top of the paper, indicating that certain tasks or goals have been successfully completed. the background color of the circular icon is a vibrant orange, which stands out starkly against the white clip icon. the entire icon is enclosed within a thick, circular border or ellipse, emphasizing its prominence. this icon likely represents a checklist or task management feature in a software application or digital tool. the checkmarks signify the completion of tasks, creating a visual cue for users to track their progress or to ensure that tasks are properly addressed and marked off their list. the image contains a pie chart showing the percentage of respondents' opinions on how cad-cam technology and 3d printing will affect the production of prostheses. the chart is divided into three segments, each representing different percentages: 1. **59%** (indicated in the small light blue segment) - individuals who think that cad-cam technology will \"replace completely the traditional prosthesis\". 2. **39%** (indicated in the large dark blue segment) - those who believe that cad-cam technology \"will play an important role, but i feel the traditional prosthetics will still be relevant in the future\". 3. **2%** (indicated in the tiny dark blue segment) - those who think that cad-cam technology \"will not play an important role because they will just affect a limited portion of the prosthetics\". the pie chart directly reflects the findings of the survey on cad-cam technology's expected impact on the field of prosthetics production. the significant difference in the responses highlights the level of acceptance and relevance of cad-cam technology within this specific population. the context of these statistics is further enhanced by the accompanying paragraphs and graphical icons in the first image, which offer supporting text to elaborate more fully on these statistical insights.", "type": "Document"}}
