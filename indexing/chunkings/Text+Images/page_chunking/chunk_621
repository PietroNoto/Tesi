represented by a large blue segment. this indicates that 88% of the doctors surveyed have received or been approached for digitizing their practice. 2. **majority (12%)** - represented by a small brown segment. this suggests that 12% of the doctors have not received or been approached about digitizing their practice. additionally, the right side of the pie chart provides a bar graph indicating the percentage of labs receiving intra-oral scan files. the data is further categorized by country: - **germany**: 32% receive these files often, 60% seldom, 8% never. - **france**: 32% receive these files often, 60% seldom, 8% never. - **italy**: 41% receive these files often, 47% seldom, 12% never. - **spain**: 25% receive these files often, 33% seldom, 42% never. - **uk**: 43% receive these files often, 28% seldom, 28% never. moreover, the image highlights reasons for not recommending digitization on the basis of lab size: - **small labs**: 45% do not consider themselves digitization experts and do not feel they are in a position to advise. - **labs without digital tools**: 24% lack the necessary tools/materials to assist in discussion. - **feeling their opinion unvalued**: 7%. - **other reasons**: 13%. overall, these charts present the impact of iot scans on lab businesses, the propensity of labs in different countries to approach dentists for digitization, and common reasons for not endorsing digitization. the image contains a pie chart with three segments, each representing the frequency of doctors' approaches about the digitization process across different cases per doctor. the segments are categorized as \"never,\" \"seldom,\" and \"often,\" with specific percentages for each category. the largest segment, consisting of 51% of the pie chart, is labeled \"never.\" this indicates that over half of the doctors surveyed do not approach digitization. the second-largest segment, representing 37% of the chart, is labeled \"seldom.\" this suggests that a substantial but slightly smaller segment of doctors approach digitization sparingly. the smallest segment, taking up 12% of the pie chart, is marked \"often.\" this indicates that a smaller percentage of doctors frequently employs digitization methods. this pie chart is visually separated from the rest of the first image, positioned at the bottom. the segmentation of responses (never, seldom, often) directly correlates with the data presented above, indicating the distribution of doctor's approaches to digitalization processes. the other parts of the first image provide additional context and comparative data points, such as the comparison of frequency across different countries in europe, the reasons for not recommending digitization, and correlations between laboratory size and preference for digitization. these elements complement the quantitative insights provided by the pie chart. the image contains a bar chart that presents the frequency of approaches to dentists about digitalization undertaken by doctors in different european countries. it accompanies a more detailed infographic in the main image to provide insight into the attitudes and behaviors of dental laboratories (labs) responding to dental digitalization. the bar chart specifically focuses on three factors: the percentage of doctors who do not consider themselves digitization experts, the percentage who note a lack of time for this activity, the percentage lacking necessary tools/materials to aid in this process, and the percentage of smaller labs versus larger labs. these categories are color-coded: light blue for smaller labs and dark blue for larger labs. for germany, 11% of doctors do not consider themselves digitalization experts, 57% of smaller labs and 32% of larger labs have these concerns, suggesting a high need for improvement or professional development. in france, 9% of doctors consider themselves non-experts and both the percentages for smaller labs and larger labs (59% and 32% respectively) remain relatively high, indicating a significant need for training and support in digitalization practices. italy shows 12% of doctors not considering themselves digitization experts, with smaller labs at 41% and larger labs at 47%, pointing to a significant gap in digital skills. for spain, the data suggests only 9% of doctors are non-experts, but smaller labs report 67% lacking the necessary tools/materials, and larger labs report 25%. in the uk, 13% of doctors claim they are not digitization experts, with smaller labs showing this concern even higher at 60%, while larger labs report 28%. the overall message conveyed by this chart is that there is a high need for digital skills training in dentistry across all countries but that smaller labs tend to face more immediate challenges due to resource constraints. the image contains a bar chart with the title \"i do not consider myself a digitization expert, do not feel i am in the position to advise,\" followed by four horizontal bars. the percentages and associated reasons for not considering oneself an expert are displayed next to the bars. the first bar, which is the longest, represents 45% who do not consider themselves digitization experts. the next bar shows 30% who do not have the time to assist with digitization projects. the third bar indicates 24% who do not have the necessary tools or materials to help with digitization. the fourth bar shows 7% who do not believe their opinion has value in digitization discussions, and the fifth bar indicates other reasons, accounting for 13%.", "type": "Document"}}
