38% not a problem (mean vote 5.9) - 29% quite a problem (mean vote 6.8) - 33% serious problem (mean vote 7.9) 2. **high costs for model printing**: - 52% not a problem (mean vote 6.0) - 31% quite a problem (mean vote 6.7) - 17% serious problem (mean vote 7.9) 3. **technology is still evolving and risk of obsolescence**: - 53% not a problem (mean vote 6.1) - 29% quite a problem (mean vote 6.8) - 17% serious problem (mean vote 7.9) 4. **being forced to use only certain software, or workflows**: - 51% not a problem (mean vote 5.9) - 29% quite a problem (mean vote 6.7) - 19% serious problem (mean vote 7.6) 5. **not suitable for extensive impressions and full arches**: - 66% not a problem (mean vote 6.0) - 16% quite a problem (mean vote 6.6) - 18% serious problem (mean vote 7.7) 6. **being forced to use only certain aligners**: - 65% not a problem (mean vote 6.0) - 21% quite a problem (mean vote 6.6) -
