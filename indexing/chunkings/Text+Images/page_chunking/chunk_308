invisalign for you? base: 55 (respondents who choose compatibility with clear aligners) country since the issue of compatibility with invisalign emerged during the focus groups, an analysis was conducted of those who identified aligner compatibility as important when choosing a scanner. of this 15%, two-thirds specifically value compatibility with invisalign. therefore, for 60% of those who answered compatibility with clear aligners\" to the previous question, this is a significant issue, likely a barrier. recalculating the weight of these respondents, it was found that for 9% of the overall sample, this is a highly relevant issue. it is a less significant concern in france, where there are fewer aligner users due to a more specialized market, while in italy and spain, where the market is more generalist, the percentage is around 9-10%. among ios owners, the percentage of those who consider compatibility with invisalign to be crucial is 10% of the overall sample, compared to 7% of non-owners. important factors when choosing a scanner the \"insurmountable\" barrier of incompatibility with invisalign affects 9% of the sample the image contains a bar chart that displays various factors prioritized by respondents in terms of importance when choosing a scanner. these factors are laid out as categories and their corresponding percentages are illustrated by the length of horizontal bars. the chart is organized with the most important factors on the top and the least important at the bottom. the most highly prioritized factor is \"reading accuracy,\" with 49% of respondents considering it very important. next is \"scanning speed,\" with 45% deeming it significant. other factors such as \"high-resolution scans & 3d files,\" \"intuitive and easy-to-use software,\" \"free software updates,\" and \"open sys. & open files export\" each have scores of 43%, indicating similar levels of importance. \"affordable price or good offer\" scores 40%, which is relatively lower compared to the top factors, and \"post-sale support and assistance\" has a score of 34%. the factors that receive slightly lower percentages include \"tip size\" (24%), \"handpiece size\" (22%), \"product training\" (19%), \"wireless handpiece\" and \"compatibility with clear aligners\" (15% each), and \"integ. with diff. workflows & softwares\" (13%). the least important factor here is \"wireless charging,\" with only 4% of respondents viewing it as very important. in the context of the overall focus and results shown in the first image, this bar chart visualizes the weight and distribution of important priorities amongst a sample of respondents, highlighting a clear gradient in the perceived value of various characteristics in scanner choices. the image contains a donut chart specifically designed to illustrate the importance of compatibility with invisalign among the sample population represented in the first image. this second image simplifies the data found in the first image by focusing entirely on the percentage of respondents who consider invisalign compatibility as important for scanners. the donut chart has three segments, color-coded for ease of understanding: the largest segment, colored in turquoise, represents 60% of respondents who consider compatibility with invisalign to be quite important (7-8) or very important (9-10). the second segment, colored in pink, represents 24% of respondents who consider it not very important (1-6). the smallest segment, in light turquoise, represents 16% of respondents. in the bottom left of the donut chart, theres a small text box stating \"9% of the total sample,\" aligning this chart with the section of the first image that includes statistical data about invisalign importance for the sample overall. the key color-coding in the legend at the bottom of the chart explains the visual distinctions: pink is labeled as \"not very important (1-6)\" turquoise is divided into two shades: light turquoise for \"quite important (7-8)\" and dark turquoise for \"very important (9-10).\" the chart effectively summarizes the key findings from the first image regarding invisalign importance, condensing the information into a highly readable and visually appealing format. the image contains a side-by-side depiction of data presented in two different graphical formats, emphasizing the significance of compatibility with invisalign among a sample group. on the right side, there is a single, larger image split into three vertical stacked bar graphs, each labeled \"france,\" \"italy,\" and \"spain.\" each bar graph visually represents the importance of compatibility with invisalign on a percentage-based scale, with two different colored segments indicating varying degrees of significance. 1. **france**: - the top section of the bar is in pink and accounts for 50% of the significance. - the bottom section is in turquoise and represents 33% of the significance. 2. **italy**: - the top section of the bar is in pink and accounts for 20% of the significance. - the bottom section is in turquoise and represents 65% of the significance. 3. **spain**: - the top section of the bar is in pink and accounts for 21% of the significance. - the bottom section is in turquoise and represents 62% of the significance. beneath each bar graph, there is a small box with the percentage indicated, corresponding to the split between the two sections of the bars: france: 5% and 33% italy: 10% and 65% spain: 9% and 62% this data suggests that in the three countries, a majority perceive high (over 50%) importance to compatibility with invisalign. the percentage breakdown emphasizes the specific range of importance, with italy reflecting the highest percentage for high importance (65%). on the left side, there are three graphical elements: first element illustrates the generalized context of compatibility concerns across three countries: a pie chart with 24% highlighted in a deeper magenta, indicating \"invisalign importance\" and the remaining 76% with alternating pink and light turquoise percentages. below, a note states \"9% of the total sample.\" second element includes a table highlighting the \"important factors when choosing a scanner\" and their corresponding percentage among io and non-io owners. factors like \"reading accuracy\" and \"free software updates\" are mentioned. third element features a detailed pie chart with various factors distributed across \"not very important (1-6)\", \"quite important (7-8)\", and \"very important (9-10)\" ratings. for instance, \"flexible scanning\" has 61%. these elements collectively show a detailed comparative perspective on how key factors influence the choice-making of io owners and their concerns regarding scanner compatibility with invisalign. to summarize this detailed analysis, the second image provides comparative data on the importance of invisalign compatibility among french, italian, and spanish populations, contrasted with an overarching chart providing a broader context. the pie charts and bar graphs show varying degrees of importance, useful for understanding the nuanced perceptions of scanner compatibility across different regions.", "type": "Document"}}
