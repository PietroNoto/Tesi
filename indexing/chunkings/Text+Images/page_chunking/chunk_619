the largest segment, in blue, representing the majority who use 3d printing regularly. 2. **we used it in the past, but do no longer (33%)** - the second-largest segment, in medium blue, indicating that some respondents have used 3d printing in the past but have ceased using it. 3. **i am familiar with its benefits and uses, but never tried it (3%)** - a small segment, in purple, indicating that while these respondents are aware of the technology, they have not yet utilized it. 4. **i am aware of 3d printing, but not familiar with its benefits and uses (2%)** - even smaller, in darker blue, showing some minimal awareness but no practical knowledge. 5. **i never heard of it (1%)** - the smallest segment, in gray, representing the minimal fraction of respondents who have no knowledge or awareness of 3d printing. this pie chart effectively visualizes the extent of usage and awareness within dental practices, clearly identifying the most significant segment that consistently employs 3d printing, while also highlighting the lesser percentages who have varying degrees of familiarity with the technology. the image contains a pie chart divided into four sections, each color-coded and labeled with a percentage. starting from the top and moving clockwise: the largest segment is blue and occupies about 49% of the pie chart. the second-largest section is also blue, but with a smaller segment, approximately 41%. next to these is another blue segment followed by a blue-gray segment, with 5% and 3% respectively. the smallest fragment in all sections is a dark blue section with 1%. the pie chart appears to be segmented into different responses from a survey regarding dentistry practices. each section likely correlates to a specific statement about 3d printing awareness and usage, although the specific statements are not labeled within the image. the pie chart is the central element of the page's visual presentation, set against a simple, light-colored background that is likely filled with explanatory text that pairs with the chart's data. the top right corner of the page indicates the chart corresponds to 'dental practices', whereas the bottom right corner notes it for 'laboratories'. this context highlights that the data is likely gathered from different dental-related contexts, either clinical settings or supportive laboratories. the overall message conveyed by this image is focused on illustrating the degree to which different dental professionals are aware of 3d printing and its usage practices. the image contains a part of a slide titled \"3d printing awareness and use.\" it is specifically focusing on dental practices. the slide provides detailed responses related to the use and awareness of 3d printing in dental practices from a sample size of 281 cases. a pie chart is presented on the left, divided into different segments reflecting respondents' awareness and usage of 3d printing in dental practices. these segments include: 63% of respondents indicate that they \"we use 3d printing.\" 33% state \"we used it in the past, but do no longer.\" 2% report being \"i am familiar with its benefits and uses, but never tried it.\" 2% mention \"i am aware of 3d printing, but not familiar with its benefits and uses.\" 1% have never heard of it. additionally, the slide includes key textual and statistical insights: \"despite the several practices providing customized devices produced with 3d printers (as shown in the following slide), only 1% declare to own a 3d printer in the surgery.\" \"rather new but rapidly increasing, 3d printing looks to be well known as to be a digital technology available for dentistry as well; only a very small portion of the respondents declare not to be aware of it (2%).\" \"only a very small portion of the respondents declare not to be aware of it.\" \"also in laboratories, only a very small portion of the respondents declare not to be aware of it.\" the overall message conveyed by this image emphasizes the current state of 3d printing awareness and usage within dental practices, revealing that while it is relatively new and growing, significant portions of the respondents are not familiar with it. the image focuses on providing visual and quantitative data to comprehend the adoption and awareness of 3d printing technology within this specific field.", "type": "Document"}}
