the blue portion (not satisfied) is relatively small at 14%. - the green portion (rather satisfied) makes up the bulk at 46%. - the red portion (very satisfied) is a notable segment at 39%. the bar graph continues with each of the feature rows, reflecting varying degrees of satisfaction across different aspects of cad-cam services. the last row shows \"overall satisfaction\" with \"not satisfied\" at 17%, \"rather satisfied\" at 52%, and \"very satisfied\" at 32%. the overall distribution highlights specific strengths and weaknesses across different companies in the cad-cam industry, illustrating the varying levels of customer satisfaction based on product quality, ease of use, technical support, and other factors. the image contains a list of criteria for customer satisfaction with different cad-cam companies, which is depicted in a detailed survey style. each criterion includes specific metrics such as the accuracy and overall quality of the restorations, compatibility with other brands, availability of materials, and various forms of technical support provided by the company. the list includes the following criteria: 1. **handiness / ease of use** 2. **accuracy and overall quality of the restorations** 3. **compatibility with other brands** 4. **wide range of materials available** 5. **technical support from the company** 6. **technical assistance in case of repair** 7. **reliability** 8. **start-up training** 9. **business development support** 10. **overall running costs** 11. **frequency of sw updates from the company** 12. **cost of sw updates** 13. **company availability and flexibility** 14. **overall satisfaction** under each criterion, there are responses from two groups labeled \"3m\" and \"others,\" each represented by percentages indicating customer satisfaction levels. each level is described with one representing \"completely not satisfied,\" and ten representing \"completely satisfied.\" the data provided includes both numerical values (percentages) and corresponding subjective statements that summarize customer feedback. the image provides a structured layout, with clear categories and responses sectioned off. the visual appearance shows color coding and organized tables, facilitating an easy comparison of various cad-cam companies' performance metrics. the base size comparisons are noted as well (e.g., \"base: 22 quotes for 3m\" and \"base: 145 quotes for others\"), highlighting the statistical significance and reliability of the data presentation. the image contains a detailed survey result that appears as a data table. the data is separated and presented in two halves, labeled as \"3m\" and \"others\". the title of the survey reads \"satisfaction: 3m, others\", and it requires users to rate their satisfaction on a scale from 1 (completely not satisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied). the base number of survey responses is specified as 22 for the 3m results and 145 for the \"others\". each category is listed, including aspects like \"handiness / ease of use\", \"accuracy and overall quality of the restorations\", \"compatibility with other brands\", \"wide range of materials available\", \"technical support from the company\", \"technical assistance in case of repair\", \"reliability\", \"startup training\", \"business development support\", \"overall running costs\", \"frequency of sw updates from the company\", \"cost of sw updates\", \"company availability and flexibility\", and \"overall satisfaction\". for each category, there is a corresponding percentage breakdown of the satisfaction ratings divided into three tiers: \"not satisfied\" (lower category), \"rather satisfied\" (middle category), and \"very satisfied\" (highest category). the numerical values for \"overall satisfaction\" are the highest for \"others\" with percentages like 62% and 51% labeled in blue, which represents \"very satisfied\", while the lower percentage of 14% in \"not satisfied\" is in red. for instance, in the \"handiness / ease of use\" category, \"others\" scored 46% \"very satisfied\" and 41% \"rather satisfied\", while for \"3m\" it is 39% and 37% in the same categories respectively. the color coding in the bar chart (likely representing the same data) uses a common visual cue in data visualization to represent categories. lighter shades typically indicate varying degrees within the category (such as degrees of satisfaction), and darker shades show overall trends per company. the bottom part of the image includes the logos of \"omni vision digital\" and \"key-stone\", which presumably represents the source companies compiling or presenting this survey. this data is relevant for understanding the relative performance and satisfaction levels of specific cad-cam companies, with visual representation enhancing clarity and quickly revealing significant trends.", "type": "Document"}}
