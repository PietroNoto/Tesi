chart, which is part of a larger report or study, indicates that 64% of respondents identified the product brand, while a substantial 35% identified the incoherent product brand. this pie chart is found within a section titled \"product associations: 3m,\" which appears to be a comprehensive analysis of product associations for different products. this chart aims to provide insight into how respondents in varying countries associate different product brands with the overall category. the pie chart is also situated in the context of a bar graph showing the percentage distributions of various associated products, such as bonding systems, composites, luting cements, impression materials, filling materials, glass ionomers, orthodontic products, phyaxis products, restorative materials, and others. additionally, there's a smaller pie chart labeled \"top 5 products\" highlighting the associations of filtex, impregum, relyx, ketac molar, scotchbond, and sorellex with the survey respondents. the smaller pie charts and table illustrate the distribution of product associations across different countries and regions. in comparison with image-1, the same pie chart is present in both images, emphasizing that 64% of responses come under the \"incoherent product brand\" in the context of various product types and country-wise distributions detailed in image- thus, the pie chart in image-2 provides crucial insight into a particular aspect of respondents' associationsspecifically highlighting the prominence of the product brand as compared to the incoherent product brand. the image contains a pie chart that is situated on the bottom portion of the page titled \"product associations: 3m.\" the pie chart is divided into four segments, each representing a specific type of product association with the product brand in question. the color codes for the chart follow the legend provided: blue shades indicating whether the product brand is coherent, a product brand, product family, or if the participant is unsure. here is a detailed description of the segments in the pie chart: 1. **incoherent product brand**: this segment is identified by the darkest color in the chart. it represents 35% of the pie chart, which indicates that 35% of the respondents associated the product brand in question incoherently. these respondents might have perceived the product brand as an accumulation of products rather than an organized brand. 2. **product brand**: this segment is colored light blue and occupies a substantial portion of the pie chart, representing 64% of the pie chart. this segment shows that 64% of respondents recognize the product brand as a strong coherent entity. these respondents likely associate the brand with a specific brand identity and recognition. 3. **product family**: this segment is indicated in a medium shade of blue and makes up the smallest portion of the pie chart, representing 1% of the pie chart. this segment reveals that only a very small percentage of respondents associated the product brand with various product families. 4. **don't know / no answer**: this segment is the lightest color and accounts for the remaining portion (0%) of the pie chart. this indicates that none of the respondents chose this option, implying that this category has no respondents in the sample. overall, the pie chart visually quantifies the strength of different associations respondents have with the product brand. it reveals that the majority of respondents view the product brand as coherent, whereas only a small fraction view it as merely part of a family of products or incoherent. the image contains a bar chart titled \"which product of the company [x] do you consider to be characteristic and indispensable for your practice?\" the bar chart visually represents consumer survey responses about whether various products offered by the company are considered characteristic, indispensable, or valuable. the following details are provided in the chart: 1. **bonding systems**: 33% of respondents consider them indispensable. 2. **composites**: 17% of respondents consider them indispensable. 3. **luting cements**: 13% consider them indispensable. 4. **impression materials**: 13% consider them indispensable. 5. **filling materials**: 13% consider them indispensable. 6. **glass ionomers**: 3% consider them indispensable. 7. **finishing and polishing**: 2% consider them indispensable. 8. **orthodontic products**: 2% consider them indispensable. 9. **prophylaxis products**: 1% consider them indispensable. 10. **restorative materials**: 1% consider them indispensable. 11. **other**: 2% consider them indispensable. 12. **dont know / no answer**: 0%. the chart is divided into two sections: one showing the proportions directly and another one at the bottom listing \"all countries.\" there is also a highlighted section, titled \"top 5 products,\" which lists items such as scotchbond, filtek, impregum, relyx, and ketac molar, indicating these may be particularly important in particular countries or regions. the values and percentage categories for these products are also represented in the chart. overall, the visual representation in this bar chart provides an easy-to-interpret summary of consumer sentiment on the indispensability of different dental products in their practice.", "type": "Document"}}
