scanning and/or chairside milling) according to the following definitions? 17 among the best performing practices the stance versus the cad-cam technologies improves: the overall opinion is the need to get closer to keep the pace of the innovation. also among the practices with a more evolved business management the opinion improves in comparison to the surgeries with a more traditional management, in particular, for those stating to have a business development plan. more discomfort: in the practices where the practices owner is higher than 55 years (38%) in the mono dental practices or just two dental chairs (33% and 36%) random sample base: 455 cases total sample the image contains a large, yellow circular background with three simplified, white human figure illustrations. the figures are identical in form, each with distinct clothing styles, and appear to be aligned horizontally. from left to right: the first figure is depicted with a dark suit, symbolizing a professional male. the middle figure is shown in what appears to be a light-colored, classical-style dress with long sleeves, indicating a feminine character. the third figure is similar to the first, adorned in a dark suit, suggesting another professional male. this second image is a visual piece placed towards the end of a data report, serving as an illustrative element amidst text-heavy content. the figures' positioning and attire suggest a subtle representation of different characters or personas, possibly aiming to highlight diversity, equality, or inclusive representation within the context of a report or discussion. the image contains a pie chart and text describing the sentiment toward cad-cam technologies, specifically intra-oral scanning and/or chairside milling, in the context of a survey of dental practitioners. the chart is in two main segments, where a segment occupying 60% shows that \"i feel uncomfortable and rather far from them,\" and the other segment indicating 30% of responding practitioners \"i am using cad-cam technologies (intra-oral scanning and chairside dental milling) but i am not comfortable with it.\" the chart is set against a bold background with accompanying texts explaining the contexts for these feelings. other descriptive elements point to the following observations: more dentists displaying discomfort with cad-cam technologies correlate with factors like the practice owner being older than 55 years (38% expressed discomfort), being in a mono dental practice (for practices with just two dental chairs, 36% showed discomfort), and for practices having a more traditional management style. the overall opinion in the best-performing practices aligns with adapting the use of cad-cam technologies in line with the pace of innovation. practices with more significant business development plans seem to have improved their view on cad-cam technologies. the pie chart is further explained in the text, indicating the base number of responses surveyed was 455, comprising various segments, with a clear breakdown highlighting different degrees of familiarity and comfort. the overall presentation combines textual data with visual graphs to convey specific messages about the reluctance versus acceptance of cad-cam technology in dental practices. the second image contains a graphic icon integrated into a circular orange background. the icon depicts a clipboard with a checked box, suggesting elements of completion, organization, and possibly approval or verification. the clipboard icon is white, with three diagonal checkmarks highlighted in orange, emphasizing a finished or approved status. the background of the circle is a deep orange and the icon is centrally placed, standing out against the uniform color. the simplicity of the design, featuring minimalistic elements, hints at clarity and efficiency, potentially related to record-keeping, documentation, or task management. the color choice of orange adds a sense of urgency or importance, ensuring the icon catches attention. the image contains a pie chart illustrating the responses to a survey about the adoption of cad-cam technologies, specifically intra-oral scanning and chairside dental milling, among respondents who are either dental offices, practices, or clinics. the data is categorized based on the comfort level dental operators have with cad-cam technologies, broken down into four distinct segments with color coding for easy visual identification. 1. **segment descriptions**: - **blue segment (60%)**: the largest portion of the pie chart, representing 60% of the respondents, who feel uncomfortable and would rather remain far from cad-cam technologies. - **dark purple segment (30%)**: this 30% of respondents use cad-cam technologies for intra-oral scanning and chairside dental milling but are not comfortable with them. - **light purple segment (9%)**: these respondents are getting closer to the digital world because they think it represents the future of prosthetics, however, they do not feel comfortable with cad-cam technologies. - **orange segment (1%)**: the smallest section, only 1% of respondents use cad-cam technologies (intra-oral scanning and chairside dental milling) and are comfortable with them. 2. **survey context**: - the survey highlights how dental practitioners perceive cad-cam technologies, specifically in relation to intra-oral scanning and chairside dental milling. - the categories align with different degrees of familiarity and comfort levels with these cutting-edge technologies. - the data suggests a broad hesitancy or resistance among dental practitioners regarding the implementation of cad-cam technologies, with a significant portion expressing comfort only for future expectations. 3. **text details**: - the text associated with the image mentions specific reasons for discomfort, such as the ownership structure of practices (older owners or those with specific practice models), business management aspects, and the perceived pace of technological change. these factors appear to influence dental practitioners' willingness to adopt cad-cam technologies. 4. **visual presentation**: - the pie chart is set prominently on the page with a color-coded, easy-to-read visual that visually conveys the proportionate breakdown of opinions regarding cad-cam technology adoption. - textual information provided further elaborates on the surveys purpose and insights gained from the data collected, offering an analytical perspective that underscores both the reluctance and the underlying issues surrounding cad-cam technology in dental practices. 5. **interpretation**: - the visual and statistical depiction underscores a significant gap between the adoption and comfort levels of cad-cam technologies in dental practices. - the findings may imply areas of intervention necessary to bridge the gap, possibly through better education about the benefits and comfort enhancement measures, or exploring how business models might adapt to accommodate these advancements more seamlessly. this detailed analysis of the image aims to provide comprehensive insight into the survey data and its implications for dental practices concerning cad-cam technologies.", "type": "Document"}}
