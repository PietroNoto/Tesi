availability of 3d printing technology in dentistry as well? 22 base: 722 cases 3d printing in general 3d printing in dentistry 3d printing awareness generally is higher among technicians than among dentists, and again the lowest grade of awareness about the availability of 3d printing in dentistry is from uk, like it happened in the sample of dentists. the second image displays a bar chart titled \"3d printing awareness\" comparing the awareness level of three-dimensional printing technology among dentists across various countries. the x-axis represents different countries (abbreviated as de, fr, it, sp, uk, which stand for germany, france, italy, spain, and the united kingdom, respectively), and the y-axis represents the percentage of awareness, ranging from 0% to 100%. the chart includes two pairs of bars for each country: the lighter blue bar represents the percentage of dentists who are aware of 3d printing technology. the gray bar represents the percentage of dentists who are aware of the availability of 3d printing technology specifically in dentistry. for each country, the following observations can be made: germany (de): 100% of dentists are aware of 3d printing general technology, whereas 92% are aware of its use in dentistry. france (fr): 100% awareness of 3d printing technology; 16% awareness of 3d printing in dentistry. italy (it): 84% aware of general 3d printing technology; 18% aware of 3d printing in dentistry. spain (sp): 82% aware of 3d printing technology; 18% aware of 3d printing in dentistry. united kingdom (uk): 79% aware of 3d printing technology; 21% aware of 3d printing in dentistry. this visualization helps in understanding the disparity between the general awareness of 3d printing technology and its specific application in dentistry among dentists across different european countries. the image contains a pie chart labeled \"no\" with 8% of the pie colored gray and the rest labeled \"yes\" with 92% colored white. the chart is set against a plain background with no additional annotations or text. the chart specifically represents a statistic or survey result concerning a yes-or-no question regarding 3d printing technology awareness among a surveyed group. the significant majority, 92%, are identified as being aware of the technology whereas a smaller segment, 8%, are not aware. this pie chart is placed towards the bottom left of an infographic, with the heading \"are you aware of the 3d printing technology?\" placed above it for context, indicating that it's a component of a larger survey or study addressing technological awareness. the image contains four distinct bar graphs arranged in two columns, indicating various percentages for different countries and a segment of those bar graphs colored differently from the others. from left to right, starting with the first column: the first bar is fully colored in blue, with 100% written above it. this suggests that all participants in this segment were aware of 3d printing technology. the first bar in the second set is colored in purple with 18% written below it. this indicates that 18% of the respondents were not aware of 3d printing technology, contrasting with the fully colored blue bar above it which signifies full awareness. the third bar is also blue but now labeled with 23%, which could imply a gap or a continuation in percentage understanding of 3d printing awareness compared to the column on the left, where all represented in blue. the right column: the first bar is in a vivid blue with 82% written, showing similar awareness. the second bar is purple and indicates 12%, suggesting 12% are not aware of 3d printing technology, again in contrast with the fully blue bars above them. the third bar is also blue with 88% written, consistent with the first column for the same awareness level. the fourth bar is more striking in its deep purple as it only shows 4% unaware, with 96% fully aware, making the lowest percentage of unawareness among the presented categories, potentially highlighting a unique situation or understanding within that particular group. the base notation indicates that 722 cases were used as a base for this data collection, showing the sample size's significance for the study. the image is from page 22 indicated at its lower right corner and its associated with a publication by omnivision digital and key-stone. the combination of these bar graphs with different colors and percentages effectively contrasts and illustrates varying levels of 3d printing awareness among different populations or subgroups, underscoring how general 3d print awareness diverges in dental environments versus general awareness. the image contains two similar pie charts, both depicting the level of awareness regarding 3d printing technology. the key differences between the two charts lie in the types of questions they cover and the specific details for two countries - germany (de) and the united kingdom (uk). at the top-left corner of the image, it poses a question: are you aware of the 3d printing technology? below this, there is a pie chart representing the responses from germany (de) and the united kingdom (uk). the pie chart shows: yes (93%): represented by a large blue segment indicating the proportion of respondents who are aware of 3d printing technology. no (7%): represented by a small purple segment indicating the proportion of respondents who are not aware. at the top-right corner of the image, there is another question: are you aware of the availability of 3d printing technology in dentistry as well? below this question, there is another pie chart representing the responses from germany (de) and the united kingdom (uk). this pie chart shows: yes (92%): a large blue segment, slightly smaller than the yes segment from the first question. no (8%): a small purple segment. beneath these two pie charts is an explanatory note stating: \"3d printing awareness generally is higher among technicians than among dentists, and again the lowest grade of awareness about the availability of 3d printing in dentistry is from uk, like it happened in the sample of dentists.\" in summary, the pie charts in the first image provide a comparative view of the awareness levels regarding 3d printing technology and its availability in dentistry across two specific regions germany (de) and the united kingdom (uk). the charts highlight a high level of awareness regarding the technology but suggest varying degrees of awareness regarding its application particularly in dentistry, with the uk showing lower awareness. both charts clearly demonstrate these trends visually through their distinct blue and purple segments.", "type": "Document"}}
