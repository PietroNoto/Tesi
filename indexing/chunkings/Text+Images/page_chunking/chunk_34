35 rather unsatisfactory item, looks to be more important to the dental practices, in the assessment of the overall satisfaction, than to the laboratories. chart customer satisfaction: bivariate correlation analysis map - europe in the lower right side of the maps there are the items whose satisfaction was not high, but whose weight on the overall satisfaction has to be considered higher than average, thus representing, from an overall point of view, key factor of success. in the sample of dental practices, the analysis highlighted the support and the assistance from the manufacturer, along with the running costs, to be critical in the assessment of the overall satisfaction. the sample of dental laboratories highlighted, other than the assistance in case of repair, a clear need for sw updates and flexibility from the manufacturer to meet the needs of their customers (laboratories). if the analysis is performed on the single manufacturers, the key factors of success become weak items, because their importance is high, but their satisfaction score is lower than average and all most relevant items mentioned for the overall analysis are present as weak items in the analysis by brand. on the laboratory side, its worth to highlight the weaknesses related to the service and support area for sirona, the running costs (overall and sw updates) and flexibility for amann girrbach and, in general, a lack of satisfaction in the area of assistance and support. the image shows two side-by-side matrices specifically focused on \"dental practices\" and \"laboratories,\" presenting a bivariate correlation analysis map. each matrix illustrates various factors that impact overall satisfaction, organized by their importance and satisfaction level. the top of the image features a title indicating the context: \"customer satisfaction: bivariate correla- tion analysis map - europe.\" ### image details 1. **title and general context:** - the title at the top center reads \"customer satisfaction: bivariate correlation analysis map - europe.\" 2. **axes and scales:** - **x-axis:** labeled as \"weight on overall satisfaction,\" with red marks on the lower left for low and the upper right for high. - **y-axis:** labeled as \"satisfaction score,\" with red marks at the bottom for low and at the top for high. 3. **dental practices**: - this matrix has eight key factors that dental practices assess: - accuracy and quality of restorations - reliability - wide range of materials - hands-on/ease of use - start-up training - frequency of sw updates - company availability and flexibility - technical assistance for repair - cost of sw updates - compatibility with other brands 4. **laboratories**: - this matrix also lists eight key factors for laboratories: - accuracy and quality of the restorations - wide range of materials available - hands-on/ease of use - technical support from the company - start-up training - technical assistance in case of repair - compatibility with other brands - frequency of sw updates 5. **axes values:** each axis segment is marked with specific values in red to visually represent low and high satisfaction levels. 6. **data points (dots):** - each matrix contains several data points representing varying levels of satisfaction for each factor category within dental practices and laboratories. ### analysis in the context of the first image the overall analysis is portrayed visually and thematically in the provided context section, highlighting particular areas of importance for dental practices and laboratories in europe. **critical points on the map:** - **dental practices critical components:** highlight specific areas such as \"accuracy and quality of restorations,\" \"reliability,\" and \"wide range of materials\" as critical in determining overall satisfaction. - **laboratories critical components:** emphasize the importance placed on \"accuracy and quality of the restorations,\" \"technical support from the company,\" and \"wide range of materials available.\" - **shared concerns:** both groups show significant importance in aspects like \"frequency of sw updates\" indicating constant technological engagement for maintaining satisfaction. **weakening factors:** - the image hints at a need for improvement in \"reliability\" for both groups and \"company availability and flexibility\" as critical yet less satisfying factors. overall, the detailed map provides a clear visual representation of the correlation between different aspects of operation and their impact on customer satisfaction for both dental practices and laboratories in europe.", "type": "Document"}}
