shows an -14% difference for software upgrades but +10% for reliability and a -7% for handiness/ease of use. key-stone has a notably high -13% difference for start-up training and software updates, indicating dissatisfaction with these aspects compared to the mean score. amann girbach has a positive 13% score for service upgrades and -6% for company availability and flexibility. additionally,
