focus on yes answers\" is presented, emphasizing the importance of the positive impacts of 3d printing on dentistry. the base for the data presented is 1000 cases. below this title, there is additional explanatory text stating: \"the answers yes belonging to all 3 possible options were summed up. the charts shown in this slide resumes the weight that the yes responses of each option has out of the total yes answers from all three options. the charts highlight that the consequence indicated to be the most probable one is an improvement in the range of materials and procedures available, which will become broader with the development of 3d printing. no relevant differences can be highlighted in the countries evaluated.\" the bar graph comprises five countries: de (germany), fr (france), it (italy), sp (spain), and uk (united kingdom). each bar represents the percentage of respondents who agree with a specific scenario, with the \"yes\" responses color-coded in two shades of blue indicating the levels of agreement. here is the detailed breakdown of each country: **germany (de):** - 20% yes responses for the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden. - 40% yes responses for the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase. - 35% yes responses for the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks. **france (fr):** - 18% yes responses for the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden. - 39% yes responses for the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase. - 43% yes responses for the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks. **italy (it):** - 27% yes responses for the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden. - 30% yes responses for the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase. - 42% yes responses for the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks. **spain (sp):** - 18% yes responses for the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden. - 40% yes responses for the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase. - 42% yes responses for the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks. **united kingdom (uk):** - 23% yes responses for the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden. - 40% yes responses for the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase. - 37% yes responses for the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks. this detailed description covers every aspect of the second image accurately and thoroughly, providing a comprehensive understanding of the data presented. the second image contains a pie chart that represents the distribution of the primary consequences brought about by 3d printing across four different countries: de, fr, it, and uk. the pie chart shows the percentage of respondents who agree with statements on the main consequences 3d printing will bring to dentistry, focusing specifically on the responses marked \"yes.\" below is a detailed breakdown of the pie chart: **41%** of respondents in germany (de) believe that 3d printing will broaden the kind of materials and procedures available. **37%** of respondents in france (fr) agree with the same statement for the same category. **22%** of respondents in italy (it) share this opinion, making the percentage lower compared to the other countries. **the remaining percentages** are not shown as distinct parts of the chart. the pie chart illustrates a comparative view of the agreement rates across the four countries in a simplified manner, without delving into further details. the distribution highlights that in denmark, france, and the united kingdom, a majority of the respondents (41% for denmark, 37% for france, and a significant 22% for italy) feel that 3d printing will significantly broaden the scope of materials and procedures available in dentistry, while in the uk, an even distribution slightly lower rates can be observed.", "type": "Document"}}
