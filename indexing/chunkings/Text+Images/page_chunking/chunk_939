there is a slight majority choosing that a brand is not relevant, with nearly equal proportions choosing it to be quite relevant and totally relevant. 2. \"highly reputable\" - similar to the first question, this one shows a similar distribution with a noticeable portion choosing a not relevant response. 3. \"worldwide renowned\" - an equal split shows that about one third of people think a brand is totally relevant, a third think it's quite relevant, and twice as many consider it not relevant. 4. \"innovative and at the forefront\" - again, a significant portion finds it not relevant, while almost equal proportions find it relevant. 5. \"makes daily practice easier\" - a majority of people find it not relevant. 6. \"trustworthy\" - here, the same pattern emerges with a majority not considering a brand to be relevant. 7. \"leading company\" - similar distribution, with a major proportion considering the brand not relevant. 8. \"recommendable to colleagues\" - a large proportion find the brand not relevant, while relatively fewer find it relevant. 9. \"affordable\" - the majority again consider the brand to not be relevant. 10. \"customer service oriented\" - here, a notable difference is seen with more people considering the brand not relevant. 11. \"too expensive\" - the highest portion finds the brand to be quite relevant, while fewer consider it totally relevant. 12. \"good price quality ratio\" - notably, 76% consider a brand to be not relevant, making it the highest for this category. overall, the charts collectively reflect a perception that a significant number of people view these brands in a negative light, particularly concerning their perceived relevance. this is notably more pronounced for questions about a brand being \"too expensive\" and \"good price quality ratio,\" though even questions like \"reliable\" and \"innovative\" attract more non-relevant responses compared to others. the image contains two main components: numerical statistics and descriptive texts. it appears to be an analysis based on participant ratings regarding certain statements about different brands, specifically comparing \"overall brands\" to \"zirkonzahn.\" two types of statistics are presented, each with accompanying percentage values: 1. **\"overall brands (666 quotes)\"**: this lists various adjectives with three columns of responses: - the first column (not specified) likely shows the percentage of respondents who found each adjective relevant to 'overall brands.' - the second column shows respondents finding each adjective 'quite relevant.' - the third column, presumably 'totally relevant,' includes participants who considered the adjective very relevant to 'overall brands.' 2. **\"zirkonzahn (42 quotes)\"**: similar to the first section, this section provides participants' responses to the same adjectives but is likely restricted to zirkonzahn. the responses are broken down into: - the percentage of respondents finding each adjective relevant, presumably to 'zirkonzahn.' - the percentage of respondents considering each adjective 'quite relevant.' - the percentage of respondents who deemed each adjective 'totally relevant.' the image also includes mean percentage values at the end in a horizontal sequence: the mean relevance for the category **zirkonzahn** includes 30%, 29%, 29%, 41%, 24%, 38%, 43%, 76%. the mean relevance for the category **overall** includes 30%, 33%, 32%, 29%, 43%, 39%, 42%, 58%. both tables are intended to compare how each brand is perceived in relation to the adjectives listed. for instance, 'good price quality ratio' is rated very highly for \"overall brands\" (76% totally relevant), while \"zirkonzahn\" shows significantly less relevance (19% totally relevant). in summary, the image provides a comparative analysis of how different brands like \"overall brands\" and \"zirkonzahn\" are perceived in various attributes, using participant ratings as a statistical basis.", "type": "Document"}}
