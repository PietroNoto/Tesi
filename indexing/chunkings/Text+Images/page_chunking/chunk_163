**detractor:** the largest segment occupies 42% of the pie chart, represented in orange. this section indicates the proportion of respondents categorized under detractors, suggesting that nearly the greatest share of respondents have a negative impact on the evaluation of the university's cad-cam. - **neutral:** the medium-sized segment covers 22% of the pie chart and is shown in blue. this category includes respondents who have a neutrally effect in the context of the cad-cam application at their college, neither positive nor negative. - **defensor:** the smallest segment takes up 36% of the pie chart and is indicated by a yellow hue. this portion represents respondents that positively influence the evaluation of the cad-cam, contributing most of the remaining respondents who are not detractors or neutral. 2. **chart legend:** - next to the pie chart is a legend that includes three colored squares: - **detractor** (in orange) - **neutral** (in blue) - **defensor** (in yellow) the legend matches the colors of the corresponding pie chart segments for easy reference. 3. **descriptive text in spanish:** the pie chart is accompanied by descriptive text that explains the implications of the \"net promoter score (nps)\" context. the nps is a key metric used in customer satisfaction studies: - **detractor:** responses from students that are between 0 to 6 are labeled as detractors, indicating dissatisfaction. - **neutral:** responses in the 7 to 8 range are considered neutral, reflecting a stance of no particular inclination. - **defensor:** scores of 9 to 10 from students are categorized as promoters, suggesting high satisfaction. 4. **indicators for the year 2015:** - the chart also features a small note indicating the percentage changes for the year 2015 compared to a different unspecified year. for detractors (orange), it decreased by 6 percent, and for defendors (yellow), it increased by 2 percent, demonstrating a trend in changing sentiments over the years. 5. **other information:** - the bottom footnote details the base for the analysis, stating it is based on \"320 cases \u2013 538 mentions.\" - there is additional text at the bottom pointing to the source and the companies involved, such as labo in digital and kei-stone, likely indicating the organizations involved in the research or data analysis process. 6. **visual layout:** - the overall layout is clean and well-structured, making it easy to differentiate between the three primary categories displayed in the pie chart. - the use of distinct colors for each segment in the pie chart aids in quick visual understanding and distinguishes the different categories for clarity. in summary, the second image specifically focuses on presenting data proportions through a pie chart in three categories \u2014 \"detractor,\" \"neutral,\" and \"defensor\" \u2014 with specific percentages and a clarifying legend for easy interpretation, and includes supplementary text to enhance the understanding of the context the percentages are derived from. the image contains a pie chart segmented into three parts, illustrating the distribution of the net promoter score (nps) among different segments based on the recommendations in terms of the likelihood of recommending cad-cam technology at a college (rated from 0 to 10 on the scale \"how likely\"?). here is a detailed breakdown of the chart: 1. **neutral category (37%)**: this segment, colored yellow, represents respondents who indicated a 'neutral' likelihood, indicating uncertainty or no particular inclination toward using cad-cam technology at a college. this is the largest segment, illustrating that a significant proportion of individuals were undecided or non-committed. 2. **defensive (32%)**: the blue section represents the 'defensive' category, which indicates respondents who said no (scored 1-6). this group holds 32% of the representation and suggests a substantial segment hesitant or against the use of cad-cam technology at college. 3. **dtraction (31%)**: the orange segment represents the 'detractor' category, including all respondents who marked 8 or above. this group, making up 31%, shows a considerable portion of individuals who are strongly opposed to the use of cad-cam technology at a college. the pie chart above is part of a larger infographic that also includes a bar graph displaying similar segment distribution for the year 2015.", "type": "Document"}}
