(multiple answer - analysis on: the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase) 38 base: 1000 cases the most skeptical respondents look to be those of germany and italy, whose percentage of negative responses was 27% and 24% respectively. very high the percentage of yes in uk. the image contains a pie chart depicting the distribution of responses to the efficiency and flexibility of a workflow brought about by 3d printing. this chart is part of a larger infographic that appears to provide an analysis related to dentistry and the perceived consequences of 3d printing implemented in this field. the pie chart itself is divided into three colored segments: a large blue segment representing 68% of the respondents. a smaller purple segment representing 20% of the respondents. a grey segment representing 11% of the respondents. in the context of the larger infographic, this pie chart appears to display the distribution of opinion or agreement regarding specific statements about the efficiency and flexibility of dentistry workflows enhanced by 3d printing. the accompanying text summarizes that respondents with high percentages of yes responses hail from countries such as germany and italy, while those with higher percentages of negative responses are seen more in the uk and ireland. to the right of the pie chart, there are four smaller bar charts aligned vertically. each bar chart represents a different countrys response percentages: germany (de) - 67% yes - 16% no - 9% don't know italy (it) - 75% yes - 9% no - 16% don't know spain (es) - 78% yes - 7% no - 14% don't know united kingdom (uk) - 82% yes - 8% no - 10% don't know each bar chart corresponds to the color coding of the larger pie chart: blue for yes, grey for no, and purple for don't know. this detailed presentation of responses across different countries provides a clear picture of the varied perceptions and levels of agreement among professionals in each nation. notably, germany and the uk feature prominently with high percentages of respondents agreeing with the positive statements related to the efficiency and flexibility of workflows, likely due to the advanced technologies and infrastructures in these countries. in contrast, the united kingdom shows a considerably higher percentage (82%) of respondents agreeing with the statements, which could reflect the successful impact of 3d printing within this countrys dental industry. this detailed examination of the second image, based on the context provided by the first image, highlights the significant perception that 3d printing can enhance efficiencies and flexibility within dental workflows. this analysis across countries illustrates varied yet largely positive trends in recognizing the value of 3d printing within dentistry. the image contains a bar chart titled \"scenario: main consequences in dentistry brought by 3d printing. which of the following statements do you agree on,\" with regard to the main consequences that 3d printing will bring to the dentistry sector. specifically, it analyzes the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow. the chart is divided into segments by country (germany, france, italy, spain, uk), each with three bars representing the percentage of respondents who agree with a yes/no response to this statement, along with an additional bar for those who don't know or are uncertain. **germany (de)**: - 64% agree, indicated with a large blue bar. - 6% don't know, indicated by a light blue bar. - 27% disagree, indicated by a gray bar. **france (fr)**: - 75% agree, shown with the largest blue bar in the chart. - 9% don't know, shown by a much smaller light blue bar. - 16% disagree, indicated by a medium gray bar. **italy (it)**: - 60% agree, illustrated by a notable blue bar. - 16% don't know, indicated by the light blue bar. - 24% disagree, shown by the gray bar. **spain (sp)**: - 78% agree, with the reddest blue bar in the chart. - 7% don't know, represented by the light blue bar, which is the smallest of the countries listed but still visible. - 14% disagree, depicted by the gray bar. **uk (uk)**: - 82% agree, indicated by the next largest blue bar. - 10% don't know, shown by the light blue bar. - 8% disagree, shown by a smaller gray bar. additionally, an accompanying pie chart visually reinforces the percentage of respondents agreeing and disagreeing with the statement. the pie chart shows germany at 68%, france at 75%, italy at 20%, spain at 12%, and the uk at 27%. both the bar and pie charts reveal a strong agreement among respondents across these countries, with france showing the highest level of agreement. the data underscores the optimistic outlook that 3d printing will enhance the efficiency and flexibility of workflow processes within the dentistry industry, as perceived by the survey respondents.", "type": "Document"}}
