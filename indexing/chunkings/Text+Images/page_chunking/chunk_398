\"completely agree\" is color-coded in orange and is represented within the bar. - \"rather agree\" is in yellow. - \"rather disagree\" is in blue. - \"completely disagree\" is in dark blue. - \"dont know, no answer\" is in grey and is not distinctly visualized within the bars, suggesting a negligible portion. *3m (37 quotes)**: the second bar is for the responses from the 3m sample group. - \"completely agree\" is again in orange. - \"rather agree\" is in yellow. - \"rather disagree\" is in blue. - \"completely disagree\" is in dark blue. - \"dont know, no answer\" remains in grey and is not clearly shown separately, implying a small group. *response distribution:** \"completely agree\" appears to have the highest response within both bars but is somewhat variable. \"rather agree\" and \"rather disagree\" show moderate response rates. \"completely disagree\" responses are relatively low. \"dont know\" responses are minimal. *legend and labels:** the legend, positioned towards the front, explains the color coding next to each text box, providing clarity on how to interpret the responses. theres a \"mean\" section displaying average numbers corresponding to each bar, enhancing understanding of overall sentiment. *image insight**: the graph shows varied responses under different response categories indicative of brand reputation and perception between the total sample and the 3m sample. the key highlights a tendency where respondents lean towards agreement over disagreement, suggesting a positive brand image. the image contains a line graph comparing the mean scores of two data sets across six categories: \"well renowned brand,\" \"cutting edge and innovative,\" \"leading company in the segment,\" \"very trustworthy,\" \"recommendable to colleagues,\" and \"customer service oriented.\" the graph is designed to show the difference in reputation evaluation for two groupsthe total sample (labeled as total) and 3m (likely referring to a specific group known as 3m). in the graph: 1. **horizontal axis (x-axis)**: the categories that are assessedwell renowned brand, cutting edge and innovative, leading company in the segment, very trustworthy, recommendable to colleagues, and customer service oriented. 2. **vertical axis (y-axis)**: the rating scale for each category, running from 1 (completely disagree) to 10 (completely agree). 3. **clusters**: - the graph is divided into three clusters indicating different levels of agreement ratings: 10 for \"completely agree,\" 5 for \"completely disagree,\" and unspecified ratings in between. - clusters of 10 are represented in light blue, 5 in pink, and in between in green. 4. **legend**: there are two linesone for the total sample (green line) and the other for the 3m sample (pink line)each showing their respective ratings across the categories. 5. **legend descriptions**: - green line with markers labeled 'total'. it aligns with the total sample data point values. - pink line with markers labeled '3m'. it aligns with the 3m sample data point values. 6. **data points**: - the graph shows paired data points for each category where a mean is calculated, visualizing the averages for what each group considers essential or agreeable. key insights include: - mean agreement for both total and 3m in \"well renowned brand\" is around 8.3. - mean agreement for both in \"cutting edge and innovative\" sits at approximately 6.5. - mean agreement for \"leading company in the segment\" and \"very trustworthy\" is around 7.8 for the total category and slightly lower for the 3m category but still close. 7. **mean comparison**: using a color-coded legend, the mean values for both total and 3m samples are plotted. data points show: - higher ratings with clustering at the extremes (10 and 5) suggesting high evaluations. - both segments share similar distributions across categories with only slight variances indicating different evaluations. in context, the graph shows that both the total sample and the 3m sample evaluate several attributes similarly highly, but there are slight differences indicating varying emphasis or values attributed to different aspects within each sample group. the image contains ten stacked bar graphs, each representing the responses to survey questions related to brand image perceptions. each vertical bar corresponds to a different response category, color-coded with yellow and blue. the stacked bars are arranged by their respective percentages for each response category, illustrating how different attitudes towards the brand are distributed among the surveyed respondents. on the left side, the first stacked bar appears to show the smallest response percentage, followed by larger percentages stacked subsequently as we move rightwards. each individual horizontal bar segment represents a specific response option selected by the respondents. for instance, one bar segment is labeled \"completely agree,\" suggesting users of that option rate the brand highest on their perceived attributes. the right side of the image shows similar segmented stacked bars, each indicating a different set of response categories across the respondents. this section is slightly offset, suggesting a comparison between two groups: total respondents and a specific subset of 3m respondents as indicated at the top-right corner. the color shifts from yellow to purple, which likely represent different datasets for comparison purposes. at the bottom, the stacked bars have larger segments, indicating more respondents chose the highest response \"completely agree\". this suggests that the specific subset of \"3m\" respondents have a noticeably higher approval or perception in comparison to the general population. the second image on the right side includes a small bar graph showing average mean scores for brand image from different response categories. this bar graph aids in understanding the central or typical response range among all participants. along the bottom, there are descriptive legends for each colored segment, providing clarity on the meaning of each response segment, further detailing the understanding of each color-coded segment. overall, the image presents an analytical comparison between two groups showing their response distribution to specific brand image and service-related questions, illustrating both the highest acceptance and areas needing improvement. the second image is a table presenting comparative data concerning brand attributes measured among respondents. it is divided into two main sections titled \"total sample (370 quotes)\" and \"3m (37 quotes)\" to compare data between larger and smaller samples. the purpose of this table appears to be analyzing responses about brand attributes, probably for purposes of a market research survey. below is a detailed description of the second image: ### **header: brand image** *text:** \"how much do you agree the following statements are relevant to the brands that i'm going to read out to you? please, use a scale where 1 stands for completely disagree and 10 stands for completely agree.\" ### **structure of the table:** **rows:** each row represents different brand image attributes, organized in descending order from top to bottom. the attributes are: - well recognized brand - cutting edge and innovative - leading company in the segment - very trustworthy - too expensive - recommended to colleagues - makes daily practice easier - customer service oriented - approachable, friendly **columns:** - **total sample**: the column shows percentages of total respondents (370 quotes). - **3m**: the column displays the percentages of respondents who are part of a smaller sample (3m, potentially meaning more specific or less random responses from a broader base, accounting for 37 quotes). ### **content of the table:** each cell in the table contains numeric values that represent percentages: **well recognized brand:** - 18% in total sample - 37% in the 3m sample **cutting edge and innovative:** - 18% in total sample - 44% in the 3m sample **leading company in the segment:** - 23% in total sample - 36% in the 3m sample **very trustworthy:** - 13% in total sample - 32% in the 3m sample **too expensive:** - 18% in total sample - 20% in the 3m sample **recommended to colleagues:** - 19% in total sample - 31% in the 3m sample **makes daily practice easier:** - 16% in total sample - 27% in the 3m sample **customer service oriented:** - this column's rows are visually shorter, indicating lower responses. - 12% in total sample - 27% in the 3m sample **approachable, friendly:** - 14% in the total sample - this row does not appear in the 3m section, indicating no data available or irrelevant data collected. ### **visuals:** **color coding:** - **blue**: represents the total sample percentage values. - **yellow**: represents the 3m sample percentage values. **mean**: on the right side of the table, a line graph indicating the mean is visible: - **total**: orange to dark orange gradient. - **3m**: yellow to greenish gradient. - specific mean values indicated alongside the line graph. ### **additional elements:** **clusters**: - a pie-like cluster chart at the bottom right shows: - **1-5**: completely disagree - **10**: completely agree - the percentages corresponding to the clusters in total and 3m samples. **key-stone**: at the footer, presumably, the logo or mark of the company that conducted the research or prepared the presentation. ### **analysis and insights from the image:** the table provides a clear comparative viewpoint, indicating higher positive perception of the brand attributes in the 3m sample, especially in terms of cutting edge and innovative. this higher sentiment might suggest a more selective or elite demographic in the 3m sample. the highlighted mean values visually reinforce that perceptions of the brand's quality, innovation, trustworthiness, and customer orientation are significantly higher among the 3m sample. this kind of data can be crucial for companies aiming to understand the factors driving brand loyalty and for developing targeted strategies to enhance these areas further. by analyzing the data from different samples, brands and marketers can identify key areas of focus for improving customer perception and tailor their marketing strategies to maximize the benefits of positive brand attributes. understanding that a different sample may present a different picture is crucial because it helps refine methods to ensure they are reaching the appropriate target audience effectively. the image contains a list of statements relevant to assessing brand image, adapted to fit into a larger, more detailed survey context (as seen in the first image). the statements included are: well renowned brand cutting edge and innovative leading company in the segment very trustworthy too expensive recommendable to colleagues make my daily practice easier customer service oriented approachable, friendly these statements form part of a survey aimed at gauging consumer views on a brand across various dimensions such as reputation, innovation, trust, pricing, and accessibility. the purpose of this survey is to gather insights into the perceptions and attitudes that customers hold toward the brand, aligning closely with the data visualization done by key-stone displayed in the first image.", "type": "Document"}}
