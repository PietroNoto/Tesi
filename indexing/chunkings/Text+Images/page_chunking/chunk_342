15 basically, the practices performing better purchased the intraoral scanner more than one year ago (36% of the practices placing more than 50 implants per year). the larger practices with a number of dental chairs higher than three, have purchased the intraoral scanner more than two years ago. the same phenomenon is observed with the number of dentists, where about 40% of the practices with more than 3 dentists state to have purchased the intraoral scanner more than two years ago. about one third of the installed equipment seem to be purchased in the last year. random sample base: 45 cases scanner owners the image contains a stylized graphic, which captures attention with its minimalist design and striking yellow background. it is a simple yet effective iconographic representation featuring three silhouetted figures arranged from left to right. the figures are depicted in white, set against a solid yellow circle. the first figure on the left is a silhouette of a standing male, appearing as a regular, straight, humanoid form. this figure is positioned so that he is directly facing the center of the graphic. the middle figure, markedly different from the others, appears as a female. she is depicted standing upright but with a pronounced, flowing gown that extends towards the ground. the flowing fabric of her dress adds a dynamic element to her silhouette, contrasting with the simpler, more straightforward form of the others. this unique dress appears to emphasize grace and elegance, making her the focal point of the group. the third figure on the right is another silhouette of a standing male, similar to the first figure, and positioned in a manner that echoes the symmetrical balance found in the arrangement of the central female. this visual symmetry contributes to the visual harmony of the iconography. overall, the image conveys a sense of balance and inclusion, presenting a diverse yet uniform group through the use of stylized figures. the minimalistic design combined with the clear color contrast ensures it demands attentiveness and leaves a lasting impression due to its visual simplicity and clarity. the image contains a pie chart and accompanying textual information. the pie chart is divided into four sections, each representing a different time period in which an intraoral scanner was purchased: \"less than 6 months\" (blue), \"from 6-12 months\" (light blue), \"from 1-2 years\" (green), and \"more than 2 years\" (red). the title of the chart reads \"experience with the intraoral scanner\" (how long do you have the intraoral scanner?) and a subheading states, \"about one third of the installed equipment seem to be purchased in the last year.\" below the pie chart, a statement elaborates: \"the larger practices with a number of dental chairs higher than three, have purchased the intraoral scanner more than two years ago. the same phenomenon is observed with the number of dentists, where about 40% of the practices with more than three dentists state to have purchased the intraoral scanner more than two years ago.\" adjacent to the pie chart, there are two icons: one of three figures (presumably dental professionals) and one of currency with a tag suggesting financial concern. below the pie chart is a callout box titled \"random sample\" indicating that the data points are based on randomized case studies. the base for the chart is \"base: 45 cases scanner owners\" which is a randomized sample of scanner owners. to the bottom right, there are icons and text that provide further insights: \"basically the practices performing better purchased the intraoral scanner more than one year ago (36% of the practices placing more than 50 implants per year).\" the image concludes with the page number \"15\" and the company logo \"key-stone.\" the overall message centers on the longer average usage duration and perhaps the better clinical outcomes associated with the intraoral scanner usage over an extended period. the image contains a pie chart that depicts the duration of experience with intraoral scanners among dental professionals. similar to the infographic in the first image, this pie chart segments the time into different intervals based on the duration of experience with the equipment: 1. **less than 6 months**: represented by almost no portion, with less than 10% contribution. 2. **from 6-12 months**: this piece comprises approximately 26%, indicated by a small blue segment. 3. **from 1-2 years**: this largest section occupies about 41%, depicted by a significant dark blue segment. 4. **more than 2 years**: this segment is relatively small, making up about 23%, visualized by a smaller light blue section.", "type": "Document"}}
