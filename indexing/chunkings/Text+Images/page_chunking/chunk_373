53 base: 570 cases total sample the relevance index is important because it highlights the ability of a brand to be spontaneously recalled by interviewees, therefore, potentially when they need to make a purchase decision. in this preparation, statements that bring the product's name instead of the brand were expressed in this analysis (for instance: cerec, that obtained 4% of spontaneous notoriety, was summed to sironia's spontaneous notoriety). random sample the image contains a bar chart highlighting the total awareness rates for various brands, focusing on cad-cam manufacturers. this comparative data visualization uses blue bars to represent total awareness percentages, with a dark blue bar on each brand indicating the relevance index. the chart's primary title suggests a focus on cad-cam manufacturers, and the relevance index provides insight into how likely respondents associated specific brands with cad-cam manufacturing. it shows the awareness of each brand and how often it was remembered when people were asked to recall a brand name associated with cad-cam applications. each brand is denoted, with their respective awareness percentages depicted in a vertical bar format: 1. **sirona** - the largest bar signifies a total awareness of 17% with the relevance index at 38%. 2. **planmecc** - this bar is the shortest, with a total awareness of 0% and is not included in the relevance index as it has no significant relevance. 3. **amann girrbach** - features a solid 2% in total awareness and closely matches sirona's relevance index at 4%. 4. **3shape** slightly higher in total awareness compared to amann girrbach, standing at 2%, but with the highest relevance index of 6%. 5. **carestream** registers a 1% total awareness, with a notably high relevance index of 7%. the graph is supported by text explaining the sample size of 570 cases, showing the relevance index's significance and how brands are remembered during spontaneous brand recalls. the total awareness is differentiated in blue bars, while the relevance index is represented by a red line connecting corresponding figures. this visual comparison provides a comprehensive view of which cad-cam manufacturers retain the most significant association among respondents. the image contains a line graph extracted from the first page, displaying the relevance index of five different brands labeled on the x-axis against a data plotted on the y-axis. the brands listed on the y-axis are sirona, planmeca, amann girrbach, 3shape, and carestream, each presented with a corresponding blue bar and purple segment that represents the sum of total awareness and unaided awareness. each segment also includes a percentage value and a relevance score, with relevance ratings visually denoted by a red downward-pointing arrow. the relevance scores start at 0.45 for sirona and steadily decrease for all brands: sirona has a relevance score of 0. planmecam is depicted without a relevance score. amann girrbach has a relevance score of 0.58. 3shape has a relevance score of 0. carestream has the lowest relevance score of 0. the graph lines are connected with a red line that increases sharply for planmeca and then shows a decline as it moves to the right. the x-axis is labeled with individual brand names and relevance rating numbers ranging from 0.03 to 0. a key note in the first image discusses a relevance index, highlighting its significance in measuring the ability of a brand to be recalled spontaneously by consumers. it mentions that the relevance index sums the product's name awareness. additionally, an explanatory text in the first image provides a clarification that the statements concerning the product's name rather than brand were meant to specify total brand awareness when referring to the relevance index for the five cad-cam manufacturers mentioned: sirona, planmeca, amann girrbach, 3shape, and carestream. further, the bottom of the image specifies a sample base of 570 cases for the analyzed total sample and displays three segments for the random sample: total awareness, colored in blue. unaided awareness, colored in light blue. relevance, colored in red. all elements of the extracted image are precisely labeled and positioned within the context provided by the broader page, ensuring that the analysis and relevance scores of each brand can be distinctly analyzed visually.", "type": "Document"}}
