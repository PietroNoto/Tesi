**yes (38%)**: this section is highlighted in blue, denoting 38% of the respondents who use a digital cloud for professional purposes. - **no (62%)**: this section is in purple, showing that 62% of respondents do not use a digital cloud for professional purposes. **chart style**: the chart is a straightforward pie chart, clearly demarcated with percentages rather than labels or descriptors typical of the first image. additionally, a large white segment is left unfilled, which is less informative than the detailed information present in image- therefore, the image in both contexts shares the essential statistics about using a digital cloud for professional purposes but differs significantly in the presentation complexity and additional information. the image contains a pie chart that is part of a larger document or report. the pie chart is labeled \"digital cloud for professional purposes - do you use a digital cloud for professional purposes?\" the chart is divided into two segments: a larger blue segment labeled \"yes 38%,\" indicating that 38% of the respondents use digital clouds for professional purposes, and a smaller purple segment labeled \"no 62%,\" indicating that 62% of the respondents do not. additionally, the chart is annotated with two small sections that seem to be highlighting specific groups: 1. \"to store data,\" with \"yes 35%\" and \"no 65%,\" indicating that among the respondents who use digital cloud for professional purposes, a majority use it for data storage. this suggests that the storage function is one of the primary uses for the digital cloud. 2. \"to exchange data,\" with \"yes 23%\" and \"no 77%,\" pointing out that a smaller number of respondents use digital clouds for the purpose of data exchange, highlighting that this use case is less common. moreover, the chart includes some additional demographic breakdowns presented in two smaller sections: \"by profession,\" showing \"madrid center (23%)\" and \"north (47%)\" indicating the regions with higher digital cloud use. \"by number of technicians,\" which presents \"1 technician (12%)\" and \"3 o ms tcnicos (32%)\" showing a correlation between the number of technicians and the use of digital clouds in the professional environment. the document from which the pie chart is extracted appears to be a study or survey's findings related to digital cloud adoption in professional settings. it includes some descriptive text explaining the data and demographic trends. the sample size mentioned at the bottom is \"578 cases (whole sample), with charts providing insights into the responses segmented by regions and team makeup. this pie chart, positioned as a key part of the graphical presentation, visually encapsulates the significant aspects of digital cloud usage across different professional parameters. the image contains a second pie chart located in a larger informational backdrop, which is part of a page containing various graphs and text. this second pie chart specifically represents the usage of digital clouds for professional purposes. the larger pie chart in the center of the page is split into three sections, each detailing a different reason for the use of digital clouds: to store data, to exchange information, and for other purposes. it is divided as follows: a large section for storing data (35% of the pie chart), another segment for exchanging information (23%), and a smaller portion for other purposes (19%). the remaining 2 sections represent laboratories that do not use a digital cloud (62%). beside these, smaller, detailed sub-pie charts provide more specific statistics. there are four sub-pie charts, each concerning different groups or specifics about users. for instance, one is segmented by region (\"madrid center\", \"north\", etc.), while another by quantity of technical staff. there are also demographic specifics regarding technicians involved; for example, \"3 or more technicians\" represent the highest segment here. this detailed sub-pie chart reveals various usage patterns across different demographic features, with clear labels for each segment. furthermore, the page contains data bases on the left side (base: 588), indicating that the entire sample consists of that many entries. the logo and names of the companies likely providing these insights are also present, suggesting a collaborative effort. a blue dental tooth icon in the bottom left seems to represent a branding or thematic element related to the professional health sector, reinforcing the context of the data. the image shows a simple pie chart containing two parts: one labeled \"yes\" and one labeled \"no.\" the segment labeled \"yes\" is a relatively small section colored in blue and occupies 19% of the chart. the significantly larger section labeled \"no\" occupies 81% of the chart and is colored in a darker tone. this minimalistic design provides a stark contrast, emphasizing the prevalence of negative responses. the chart is circular, with the text clearly indicating the percentages associated with each color-coded segment. the background is neutral, ensuring that the segments stand out clearly.", "type": "Document"}}
