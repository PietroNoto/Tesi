the image contains a bar chart titled \"brand image vs recommendation - correlation analysis,\" which is part of a page from a presentation or report. the chart is from omnivision and keystone, and details the outcome of a bivariate correlation analysis that investigates how single factors affecting brand image correlate with their influence on the quality of recommendations given by consumers. ### description of the bar chart (image 2): 1. **title and headings**: - the chart has the title \"brand image vs recommendation - correlation analysis.\" - on the left side of the chart, each bars value is labeled as \"items weight on recommendation.\" - on the far-right, it indicates the numeric score for each factor. 2. **factors**: - the factors are listed vertically as follows: trustworthy reliable highly reputable makes daily practice easier worldwide renowned innovative and at the forefront leading company customer service oriented good price quality ratio affordable too expensive 3. **values and scores**: - each factor is denoted by a horizontal bar, with corresponding numerical values indicating the \"items weight on recommendation.\" - the values and the scores are as follows: - **trustworthy**: score 0.512, items weight on recommendation 4.24 - **reliable**: score 0.499, items weight on recommendation 4.23 - **highly reputable**: score 0.445, items weight on recommendation 4.28 - **makes daily practice easier**: score 0.429, items weight on recommendation 4.07 - **worldwide renowned**: score 0.411, items weight on recommendation 4.15 - **innovative and at the forefront**: score 0.404, items weight on recommendation 4.06 - **leading company**: score 0.355, items weight on recommendation 4.03 - **customer service oriented**: score 0.336, items weight on recommendation 4.01 - **good price quality ratio**: score 0.272, items weight on recommendation 3.59 - **affordable**: score 0.200, items weight on recommendation 3.50 - **too expensive**: score 0.106, items weight on recommendation 3.64 the chart visually represents the correlation between different attributes of a brand and the importance consumers attach to them when making recommendations. this breakdown aids in understanding which qualities consumers view as most influential in their recommendations, helping businesses prioritize their branding efforts to build a stronger market presence. the image shows an extended list of item scores extracted from a table that is not fully visible. however, the context points out a correlation analysis conducted on brand image attributes impacting recommendation. it details multiple factors such as trustworthiness, reliability, reputedness, and others, alongside their respective scores and significance on the recommendation. key features of this section: the table on the left section of the image defines a bivariate correlation analysis method to understand which factors most influence recommendation. it includes specific figures for each factor's weight on recommendation. each item's relationship to recommendation is visually represented with a weight on recommendation column. next to this, theres a corresponding column titled 'items score,' showing numerical scores ranging from nearly 3.5 to above 4. some of the factors analyzed include trustworthiness (4.24), reliability (4.23), reputedness (4.28), and customer service orientation (4.07). given that specific correlations of 3.5 to 4.5 indicate strong influence on recommendation: trustworthiness, reliability, and reputedness significantly affect recommendation, scoring high in the range between 4.23 and 4. other attributes like global reach, being at the forefront, and leading company also exhibit high correlation values around 4.15 to 4. additional factors like price quality ratio, being affordable, and not being too expensive show lesser but substantial relevance, reflecting lower to 3.64 scores. the second image segment shown: displays a continuation or a focused segment, emphasizing high-scoring attributes with numbers ranging from 3.5 to 4.5.", "type": "Document"}}
