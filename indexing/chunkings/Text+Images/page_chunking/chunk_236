percentage of the chart. **product brand** is depicted in a lighter blue shade and constitutes a significant portion of the chart. **product family** is shown in a light teal color and takes up the largest area by far, indicating the highest preference among the listed associations. to the right of the pie chart, there is a legend explaining the color-coding and what each section represents: **incoherent product brand** (dark blue) **product brand** (light blue) **product family** (light teal) **don't know / no answer** (gray) there is a note also included indicating the base for the

**endodontic products** with 28%, closely followed by **composites** at 13% and **impression materials** at 7%. under \"product family,\" **endodontic products** again dominate, with an overwhelming 66% of respondents favoring it. in the lower right section, there are tabs for countries with their respective data including values for fr, it, sp, nl, and uk. each country section provides the same three categories with corresponding percentage values like fr = france, it = italy, sp = spain, nl = netherlands, and uk = united kingdom. overall, the chart prominently highlights that among respondents, \"endodontic products\" are considered the most coherent and indispensable for dental practice, followed closely by \"composites\" and \"impression materials\" for the product brand, and

respondents. another small section labeled \"dont know / no answer,\" which is not quantified but may contain the remaining respondents who did not provide an answer. additionally, the chart's overall background is light blue and is accompanied by a table on the top right detailing responses by country, with percentages for certain dentsply sirona products and categories such as endodontic products, composites, impression materials, etc. the country-wise analysis shows varying percentages on different product lines and brands, suggesting varied market penetration and brand recognition
