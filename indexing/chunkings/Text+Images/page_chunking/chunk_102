(282 casos) (201 casos) (282 casos) (201 casos) la distribuci\u00f3n de usuarios para esc\u00e1neres intraorales y unidades de fresado chairside es bastante estable, con un ligero incremento que afecta tan s\u00f3lo a los usuarios de esc\u00e1ner. se estima la presencia de unos 1.500 / 1.800 esc\u00e1neres ya instalados en la fecha de realizaci\u00f3n de la encuesta (finales de 2018). considerando una tasa media de crecimiento de en torno al 50% para las ventas en unidades (datos procedente del estudio flash equipment), se estima que a finales de 2019 el porcentaje de cl\u00ednicas equipadas con esc\u00e1ner intraoral se situar\u00e1 en torno al 12%. clinic the image contains two bar graphs positioned next to each other, representing data on the usage of digital technologies in dental clinics. the graphs are labeled in spanish, and they compare the percentage of clinics adopting specific dental technologies between the years 2015 and 2018. *description and analysis of the second image:** *graph 1: intraoral digital scanners** **x-axis:** represents the time period which includes years 2015 and 2018. **y-axis:** represents the percentage of clinics using digital technologies. **bars:** - blue bars: represent the percentage of clinics using the technology. - grey bars: represent the percentage of clinics not using the technology. **specific data:** - in 2015, **96%** of clinics use digital scanners compared to **4%** that do not. - in 2018, **95%** of clinics use digital scanners whereas **5%** do not. each bar graph provides a clear visual and percentage-based comparison, emphasizing a substantial increase in the adoption of digital scanners in dental clinics between the two years. over time, the percentage of clinics using digital scanners in 2018 was nearly identical to that of 2015, showing robust adoption and widespread integration of the technology. *graph 2: intraoral digital impression systems** **x-axis:** represents the years 2015 and 2018. **y-axis:** represents the percentage of clinics using digital technologies. **bars:** - blue bars: represent the percentage of clinics using the system. - grey bars: represent the percentage of clinics not using the system. **specific data:** - in 2015, **92%** of clinics use digital impression systems compared to **8%** that do not. - in 2018, **93%** of clinics use digital impression systems whereas **7%** do not. the graph indicates a significant increase in the use of digital impression systems over the analyzed time frame. the adoption rate of digital impression systems saw a marked rise, with a higher percentage of clinics using the technology in 2018 compared to 2015. *correlation with the first image:** the first image is a part of a study document detailing the use of digital technology in clinics, specifically focusing on the data from this image. the second image's detailed bar graphs depict a comprehensive visual representation that illustrates the clinical trends clearly. together, they provide a thorough understanding of how digital technologies have been increasingly adopted by dental clinics over the specified years. *contextual relevance:** the data provided highlights the shift towards digital dental technologies, emphasizing the importance of integrating such systems for improved operational efficiency and patient outcomes. as the bar graphs show a high percentage of clinics adopting digital technologies, this suggests a move towards a more digitized dental practice environment where precision and streamlined workflows are prioritized. the image contains a bar graph titled \"usarios de tecnolog\u00edas digitales \u2022 p\u00f3seen los siguientes equipos en su clinica?\" which translates to \"digital technology users \u2013 have you considered the following equipment in your clinic?\". the graph is designed to show the survey results over a two-year period, differentiating between the years 2015 and the x-axis depicts the years noted at the bottom, indicating \"yes\" on the far left and \"no\" on the far right, with the percentage shown for responses marked at the top of each bar. two categories of digital technology are represented by bars: 1. \"esc\u00f3farinas para la toma de impresiones digitales\" (stamps for taking digital impressions) - in 2015: 94% yes (blue bar), 6% no (purple bar) - in 2018: 92% yes (blue bar), 8% no (purple bar). the percentage difference between the two bars for this category is just 2%. 2. \"unidades de frezado chairside\" (ultra-sound chairside units for dentistry) - in 2015: 95% yes (blue bar), 5% no (purple bar) - in 2018: 95% yes (blue bar), 5% no (purple bar) the percentage difference here is zero, indicating no significant change. the y-axis (though not labeled explicitly) represents the percentage percentage of respondents in a structured layout. each year is distinctly separated by a horizontal line, each with the corresponding percentage depicted. underlying the graph is a statement noting that the distribution of users for intraoral scanners and flossing units has remained stable, but a \"slight increase\" can be observed for intraoral scanners. it mentions that around 1,800 devices have been installed to materialize this predicted growth. in the lower right corner, a reference to dental equipment is included, specifically mentioning equipment for the flash study and predictions. it hints at a medium-term growth rate of 50% in units (flash study data), projecting about 12% of clinics with such equipment by the end of the overall design relies on a high contrast between the blue and purple bars, with blue dominant for positive replies and purple indicating negative replies, emphasizing clear and easily interpretable data points.", "type": "Document"}}
