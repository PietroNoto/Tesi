digital prothesis providers: technology: 28% (implants), 71% (traditional elements). - digital prothesis providers: channel: 40% (implants), 59% (traditional elements). the second bar graph in the middle is labeled \"impressions\" and lists the following percentages: - digital prothesis providers: technology: 29% (implants), 70% (traditional elements). - digital prothesis providers: channel: 29% (implants), 70% (traditional elements). the third bar graph on the right is labeled \"partner-lab\" and lists the following percentages: - digital prothesis providers: technology: 42% (implants), 58% (traditional elements). - digital prothesis providers: channel: 40% (implants), 60% (traditional elements). the fourth bar graph on the far right is labeled \"manufacturer center\" and lists the following percentages: - digital prothesis providers: technology: 28% (implants), 71% (traditional elements). - digital prothesis providers: channel: 60% (implants), 40% (traditional elements). above the first bar graph in the first image, there is text in spanish addressing the proportion of elements produced and whether these elements are digital or traditional prosthesis. on the bottom part of the first image, a table titled \"digital production share\" presents detailed numbers indicating that out of 123 cases of dental production, 3 in 2018 were done entirely with digital workflow, 2 were partly for implant applications, 1 for traditional applications, and 113 in total did not provide digital prosthesis. in the footer of the first image, there is a caption indicating that the data is based on \"123 cases\" and it specifies that the source of the data is \"omnivision digital.\" the page is numbered 13 at the bottom left corner. additionally, the logos of \"omnivision\" and \"key-stone\" are present at the bottom.", "type": "Document"}}
