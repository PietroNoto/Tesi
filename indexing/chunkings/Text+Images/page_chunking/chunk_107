no proprietaires,\" indicating that the survey respondents do not prefer to specify a particular brand or to be considered proprietary to a brand. another set of results from a different survey group, showing the percentage of respondents from each survey group who either have the intention to acquire 3d printing or not, with a highlighted 55% of the sample size in both the surveys combined. note also that each section inside the pie chart represents different segments, which are likely categorized by specific dental lab groups, but the smaller bars indicate their responses, with percentages shown across the pie chart. below the pie chart, additional textual content is present. the topmost includes phrases in spanish such as \"al profeundar en los clusters demogr\u00e1ficos y estructurales no se han hallado diferencias importantes\" referring to an analysis within demographic and structural clusters and noting no significant differences were found. at the bottom of this chart is the logo \"key-stone\" emphasizing the brand. the image contains a bar chart displaying the results of a survey about the intention of acquiring a 3d impression technology within the next two years. the chart specifically details the responses from an unspecified sample of 56 cases, as noted in the image. each bar represents different companies that either did or did not have the intention of acquiring 3d technology along with their percentage of responses and the proportion of cases. specifically: **3m:** 9% of the cases surveyed intend to acquire a 3d impression technology in the next two years. **formlabs:** 7% intend to make the acquisition. **planmeca:** 5% intend to purchase such technology. **dentsply sirona:** 4% intend to invest in 3d technology. **kajo:** 4% intend to acquire 3d technology. **align technology:** 4% have the intention. **carestream:** 4% intend to acquire 3d technology. **straumann:** 4% have plans to purchase 3d technology. **3shape:** 2% intend to obtain this technology. **sprintray:** 2% have the intention. **other:** 2% intends to acquire 3d technology. **don't know / no answer:** 55% of the cases surveyed did not have a known intention in this regard. the chart indicates a clear trend of uncertainty among the respondents regarding the future acquisition of 3d impression technology, with the majority (55%) of the respondents not providing a direct answer. the highest and most common planned acquisitions are by smaller, specialized technology firms with well-established roles in dental instruments and materials. this information is useful for companies looking to enter the market in the 3d impression technology sector or for evaluating future trends in dental technology acquisition within the dentistry industry.", "type": "Document"}}
