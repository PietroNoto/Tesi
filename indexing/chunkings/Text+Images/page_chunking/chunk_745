(scores from 1 strongly disagree to 10 strongly agree) compared to 2015, the percentage of those declaring unsatisfactory quality / price ratio decreases considerably, in favor of the area of high satisfaction, that increases by a few points. mean: 6,6 clinic base: 36 cases - 45 quotes (owners) 97 the possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores. the clustering is the following: low value/price ratio: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 1 to medium value/price ratio: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to high value/price ratio: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 9 to the image contains a pie chart focusing on the perceived value score distribution of a company brand. the pie chart is divided into three sections, each corresponding to a different perceived value/price ratio score range. the color-coding visually distinguishes the percentage and range of each section. 1. **high value/price ratio:** this section is colored blue and constitutes 20% of the pie chart. it represents respondents who scored in the range of 1 to 6, indicating a high valuation to price ratio but possibly lower perceived quality or functionality. 2. **medium value/price ratio:** this section, highlighted in yellow, occupies 33% of the chart. it is attributed to respondents scoring in the 7 to 8 range. these individuals have a balanced yet moderate perception of value to price with better quality or functionality relative to the cost. 3. **low value/price ratio:** colored in red-orange, this segment makes up 47% of the chart and represents respondents scoring in the 9 to 10 range. these individuals feel the value and price balance is least optimal, possibly perceiving high cost without significant better quality or functionality. overall, the chart visually portrays the companys brand perception across three value(price) score segments, emphasizing varied levels of quality to price ratio among respondents. the percentage data provide insight into the balance between perceived value and price the company offers, according to survey participants. the image contains a pie chart detailing the perceived value score distribution of \"cad-cam equipment\" across three different value-price ratio clusters. the pie chart is accompanied by percentages and mean values indicating the extent to which respondents agree that the equipment has an ideal price/quality ratio. the chart includes the following segments: **low value/price ratio:** represented in red, constituting 33% of the chart, indicating respondents who score from 1 to 6 **medium value/price ratio:** represented in blue, constituting 47% of the chart, indicating respondents who score from 7 to 8 **high value/price ratio:** represented in yellow, constituting 20% of the chart, indicating respondents who score from 9 to 10 additionally, the chart provides a mean value for these responses, with the overall mean being 6, this mean value is used as a reference point, showing the general consensus within the group of respondents. each of the segments is carefully color-coded to differentiate the respective value-price ratio areas, making the data easily distinguishable. in the context of the image's main content area, this pie chart represents one of the findings from the study conducted by omnivision digital and key-stone clinic. the findings reveal that, out of 36 cases and 45 quotes (owned by owners), the opinion on the cad-cam equipment value/price ratio is mostly moderate, with the largest segment of respondents (47%) considering it as having a medium value/price ratio. this moderate position is seen as a significant shift compared to 2015, where the mean score was higher at 6,2 and the distribution leaned slightly more towards a medium value/price ratio, indicating an overall improvement in perceived satisfaction among owners in terms of the value/performance relationship of the cad-cam equipment. the image's overall message aligns with the study's aim to assess the quality/performance relationship of the cad-cam equipment as perceived by owners within the industry. the chart effectively segments this data into various value-price ratio categories, allowing for a clear understanding of the perceived value score distribution among current owners.", "type": "Document"}}
