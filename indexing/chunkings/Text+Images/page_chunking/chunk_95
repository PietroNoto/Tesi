3,4 fielidad (loyalty) - 3,5 asegurado (assured) - 3,4 fabricaci\u00f3n del producto (product design) - 3,8 precio (price) - 3,9 servicio al cliente (customer service) - 3,9 innovadora (innovative) - 3,8 practica diar\u00eda (daily practice) - 3,5 the bars are colored red. the scale value starts from the base at 3.3, showing the value that represents each attribute related to the item, and the height of the bars increases based on these values. each item has a number next to its bar showing the precise measurement value that each attribute scores in relation to the marcas's recommendation. the top of the chart is aligned horizontally with the listed parameters, all relating to important factors or conditions that might influence the recommendation process in the context of social media media (todas las marcas). each bar height appears to be roughly consistent across the list, suggesting that these attributes are equally significant in the recommendation process and are measured precisely to assess their influence. this visual representation makes it clear that the trust level is the lowest at 3,4, followed by loyalty (3,5) and daily practice (also 3,5). meanwhile, fabricaci\u00f3n del producto (design) and price are slightly higher, scoring 3,8 and 3,9 respectively, indicating their critical points in the recommendation context. this consistent presentation allows for direct comparison of each attribute without overly complex data visualization, making it easier for an observer to analyze the importance each factor holds based on their individual scores. the second image is a section of a larger page presented in a document. the section is a bar graph and text analysis titled \"imagen de marca vs. recomendaci\u00f3n: an\u00e1lisis de correlaci\u00f3n,\" which translates to \"brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis.\" it presents a set of correlation values for different factors in relation to brand perception and recommendation. the image contains a textual description followed by a bar graph. here's a detailed description of the content: ### textual description: the textual portion begins with a header, followed by a brief introduction in spanish. the main points discussed include: **importance of items (importancia de los items)**: this section outlines the importance of certain factors when considering brand perception. **correlation with recommendation (correlaci\u00f3n)**: an overview of how varying items (from 'confianza' to 'demasiado caro') correlate with customer recommendation levels. ### bar graph: the bar graph, labeled \"importancia de los items (importance of items) vs. puntuaci\u00f3n media (average score),\" features horizontal bars illustrating the importance of various factors and their relation to customer recommendations through average scores. 1. **confianza / trust**: - this item is presented at a score of approximately 3.0, representing the importance of trust for the customers. it has an average score of 0.797. 2. **fiabilidad / reliability**: - the term 'fiabilidad' is noted at around the same average score as 'confianza,' approximately 0.763. 3. **servicio orientado al cliente / customer-oriented service**: - this factor is crucial as it stands at 0.711, showing substantial importance. 4. **asequible / affordable**: - the affordability factor is shown with an average score of 0.672. 5. **facilidad la pr\u00e1ctica diaria / ease of daily use**: - the importance of daily usability comes to a score of 0.661. 6. **innovador / innovative**: - innovative features scored an average of 0.657. 7. **de gran reputaci\u00f3n / high reputation**: - scored at 0.652, emphasizing the reputation's significance. 8. **mundialmente conocido / globally known**: - this point stands at 0.616, indicating its lesser importance compared to others in the context. 9. **compa\u00f1\u00eda lider / leader company**: - scored around 0.586, indicating its importance. 10. **buena calidad/precio / good quality/price ratio**: - demonstrated with an average of 0.513, balancing quality and pricing. 11. **demasiado caro / too expensive**: - lastly, the perception regarding the product being too pricy is at 3.0 or near 0.220, negatively impacting the overall recommendation. ### graphical elements: the graph's x-axis lists the factors for which the correlation values are provided. the y-axis is not directly labeled but represents the percentage of correlation or importance each factor holds. color-coded bars enhance readability and provide visual clarity. overall, the second image is a detailed correlation analysis chart that outlines how different brand attributes impact its recommendation factor, supported by specific numerical scores and visual charts.", "type": "Document"}}
