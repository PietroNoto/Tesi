29 the following chart shows the penetration of the different technologies calculated on the whole sample. among digital technology users, the most used way to provide digital restorations is to send impressions in full outsourcing to partner-labs or manufacturers / milling centers, with a 41% of users, but a slight increase in the use of the scans can be noted (6% vs 4% in 2015). base: 123 cases (digital prosthesis providers) since practices may use different technologies and channels, the sum of percentages is higher than 100%. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. percentage of surgeries - digital users only percentage of surgeries - whole sample the image contains a bar chart titled \"percentage of surgeries - whole sample.\" the chart is a comparative analysis of different digital technology utilization percentages for surgical purposes across two different years: 2018 and the x-axis of the chart lists four categories of digital technology use: chairside milling scans impressions non-users of digital technologies the y-axis represents the percentage of surgeries for which each of these categories is employed. in the chart, two sets of green and blue bars are used to differentiate between the years: green bars represent the year blue bars represent the year observations: 1. **chairside milling:** both 2018 and 2015 show a minimal percentage, with 4% and 5% respectively. 2. **scans:** an identical increase is noted with 6% in 2018 and 4% in 2015. 3. **impressions:** surprisingly, there is a significant jump for impressions between 2015 and 2018, with 41% in 2015 and 57% in 2018, indicating a substantial increase. 4. **non-users of digital technologies:** this percentage is consistently high at 57% for both years, indicating a majority of surgeries were done using non-digital technologies. the title of the first image, \"digital technology use - breakdown by technology,\" suggests a broader context, detailing various techniques used by digital technology users versus those who employ conventional methods. the footnote states that since practices may use different technologies and channels, \"the sum of percentages is higher than 100%.\" these additional insights suggest a more complex breakdown was originally presented but aggregated for simplicity. below the main chart, there are visual indicators for comparisons between 2018 and the notable differences are highlighted in the chart, though the increments below +/- 2% are denoted as not statistically relevant: 1. **chairside milling:** 2015 (5%) compared to 2018 (4%) 2. **scans:** 2015 (4%) compared to 2018 (6%) 3. **impressions:** 2015 (41%) compared to 2018 (57%) 4. **non-users of digital technologies:** 2015 (57%) compared to 2018 (57%) in the bottom-left corner is an omnivision logo, indicating the source or affiliation connected to this visual presentation. additionally, a similar bar chart, presumably the same, is repeated in the bottom-right corner, reaffirming the same trends without further detailed context. the image, titled \"breakdown by technology\" from the digital technology use survey conducted by omnivision digital, provides a detailed analysis of how different technologies are used by various practices to provide digital restorations. *content of the second image:** the second part of the image focuses specifically on a bar chart labeled \"percentage of surgeries - whole sample\", which breaks down the use of different digital technologies by types of surgeries across two observed years: 2018 and here are specific details derived from this chart: *general breakdown:** **whole sample**: the chart includes both 2018 and 2015 data for digital restorations, illustrating an increase in technologies used by practices over time. **digital users only**: the chart also contains specific figures for surgeries conducted by digital users, which offer insights into practices using digital technologies predominantly. *detailed analysis by type of surgery, in percentage terms**: 1. **chairside milling - digital users only**: - **2018**: 11% - **2015**: 5% 2. **scans sent to other partner labs - digital users only**: - **2018**: 15% - **2015**: 8% 3. **scans sent to manufacturers / milling centers - digital users only**: - **2018**: 7% - **2015**: 5% 4. **impressions sent to other partner labs - digital users only**: - **2018**: 92% - **2015**: 64% 5. **impressions sent to manufacturers / milling centers - digital users only**: - **2018**: 36% - **2015**: 20% 6. **non-users of digital technologies**: - **2018**: 57% - **2015**: 54% *observations:** there is a noticeable increase in the usage of digital technologies across the board, suggesting a growing reliance and integration of digital tools in dental practices. significant jumps, particularly in 'impressions sent to other partner labs' indicate a strong adoption of digital impression techniques. 'chairside milling' shows a doubling from 5% in 2015 to 11% in the proportion of non-users decreases slightly, indicating increased digital adoption among practitioners. 'scans sent to manufacturers / milling centers' shows a marginal increase from 5% to 7%. these specific details present an informed view of how digital technologies are increasingly part of the restoration process in dentistry, highlighting areas where digital integration is most prevalent and growing.", "type": "Document"}}
