if yes, what brand(s) are you going to consider for purchase?\" ### breakdown of content: 1. **overall section:** - **title:** - \"are you willing to purchase an intraoral scanner to take digital impressions within 2 years?\" - a secondary title states, \"if yes, what brand(s) are you going to consider for purchase?\" 2. **bar chart:** - **brands displayed:** - 3shape - dentsply sirona - align technology - carestream - c3m - planmeca - kavo - straumann - dental wings - gc - opra system - other - **percentage and position:** - 3shape with 27% is the most preferred brand. - dentsply sirona with 14%. - align technology with 13%. - carestream is next with 9%. - c3m with 7%. - planmeca with 3%. - kavo, straumann, dental wings, gc, opra system with 1% each. - the 'other' category also comprises 1%. 3. **additional notes:** - a small text next to the bar chart states, \"the numeric distribution is the percentage of clients that mentioned a certain brand.\" - another note mentions, \"due to the lower number of cases, these figures should be taken as an indication only.\" - the chart shows a significant percentage of respondents who don't know or have no answer (44%). 4. **source information:** - the chart indicates the sample size (259 cases) that informs the base for each brand, suggesting that the distribution provided is representative data extracted from this sample. *additional context in the image (from the first image):** on the left side of the image, there is a pie chart labeled \"intention to buy,\" showing: - 36% (yes) - 64% (no) below these pie charts are demographic insights: - \"age of the owner > 55\" with 25% preference. - \"opening year before 1999\" 27%. - \"opening year 1999-2018\" 44%. - \"3 or more dental units\" 51%. a note mentioning that the data points in \"don't know / no answer\" make up 44%, based on 94 cases. *conclusion with chain of thought:** by analyzing the detailed bar chart and understanding what brands are preferred in the dental community for purchasing an intraoral scanner, it's evident that 3shape holds the leading position with a significant 27%. dentsply sirona and align technology follow suit but lag notably behind. the lower percentage values for the other listed brands suggest that while they are considered, 3shape is the clear top choice among non-owner dentists surveyed. the cautionary note on lower sample size and the considerable number responding with a 'don't know' or 'no answer' underscore practical limitations in drawing definitive conclusions from the data, yet the trend is sufficiently clear.", "type": "Document"}}
