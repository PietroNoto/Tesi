amann girbach - 1% - zirkonzahn - 2% - sirona - 2% - dentsply - 2% - roland - 2% - imes-icore - 3% - vhf - 3% - kavo - 3% - dental concept - 10% - zfx - 5% - r+k - 5% - total: 93 **fr (france)**: - sirona -

dentsply - 5% - vhf - 5% - dental concept - 6% - zfx - 5% - total: 10 the tables are designed to provide a clear, numerical breakdown of which brands are in common use across different regions, despite the overall data limitation and subsequent qualitative framing. the visual components combined offer an informative snapshot of brand preferences in the field of in-lab milling. the image contains a bar graph displaying the numeric distribution of in-lab milling units in various brands used by a specific group, referenced by a base of 139 cases. the title of the graph is \"brand numeric distribution: in-lab milling.\" a notable feature of the graph's upper left-hand section shows a pie chart that breaks down the in-lab milling users into two categories: \"yes, i use in-lab milling,\" accounting for 34% of participants, and \"no, i dont,\" occupying the larger share of 66%. to the right of this pie chart is a legend explaining \"in-lab milling users on digital restorations providers,\" which indicates the distribution among different dental brands. the rest of the image consists of a detailed bar chart that categorizes the respondents' responses by brand usage: 1. **amann girrbach** - 17% 2. **zirkonzahn** - 16% 3. **sirona** - 15% 4. **dentsply** - 12% 5. **roland** - 6% 6. **imes-icore** - 5% 7. **wieland** - 4% 8. **vhf** - 3% 9. **kavo** - 3% 10. **other** - 15% 11. **dont know** - 6% each brand category has an associated blue bar segment, with the percentage values clearly displayed on the right side of each bar. additionally, the \"other\" category has a greyed-out bar to differentiate responses that do not correspond to any named brand. to the right of the bar graph, there are three tables with the breakdown of these data by country, showing the relative numbers in de, fr, it, and uk: 1. **germany (de)**: - amann girrbach - 1 - zirkonzahn - 2 - sirona - 4 - dentsply - 6 - vhf - 5 - imes-icore - 6 - roland - multiple - others - unknown - 1 - total - 39 2. **france (fr)**: - sirona - 1 - roland - 2 - zirkonzahn -

(note: the exact specifics of the brands' breakdown in the tables may not be completely detailed here, and these values are approximate as inferred from the given image content for the description.)", "type": "Document"}}
