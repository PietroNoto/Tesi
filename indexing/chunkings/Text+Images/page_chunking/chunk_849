(282 cases) (201 cases) the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. percentage of surgeries - digital users only percentage of surgeries - whole sample the image contains two bar graphs comparing the usage of digital restorations by different channels across two distinct years: 2015 and the first graph is situated on the left side and is titled \"percentage of surgeries - digital users only.\" it details the distribution of digital restorations sent through various channels for the years 2015 and the vertical axis indicates the percentage from 4% to 92%, while the horizontal axis lists different channels for sending digital restorations. the categories are: chairside milling scans sent to other partner labs scans sent to manufacturers / milling centers impressions sent to other partner labs impressions sent to manufacturers / milling centers according to the graph, in 2015: chairside milling comprised 11%. scans sent to other partner labs were 15%. scans sent to manufacturers / milling centers were 7%. impressions sent to other partner labs accounted for 92%. impressions sent to manufacturers / milling centers were 16%. by 2018: chairside milling increased slightly to 11%. scans sent to other partner labs decreased to 15%. scans sent to manufacturers / milling centers rose to 7%. impressions sent to other partner labs remained stationary at 92%. impressions sent to manufacturers / milling centers significantly decreased to 16%. the overall message from this graph is that while there are variations in the distribution of digital restorations across the channels, the overwhelming majority (92%) continues to be sent to other partner labs, with little change over the years. the second graph is positioned on the right side and is titled \"percentage of surgeries - whole sample.\" it presents the distribution of the different channels in terms of the whole sample across the same two years, 2015 and this graph categorizes the channels differently, with the vertical axis also ranging from 4% to 57%, and it provides distinct values for certain categories. the channels are: chairside milling partner-lab manufacturer / milling center non-users of digital technologies for 2015, the respective distribution for the whole sample was: chairside milling: 4% partner-lab: 41% manufacturer / milling center: 41% non-users of digital technologies: 57% by 2018: chairside milling remained at 4% partner-lab increased to 41% manufacturer / milling center decreased to 12% non-users of digital technologies decreased to 57% the central point from this second graph is the stability of the usage pattern within the digital user sample compared to the significant variance in non-users, where there has been a notable shift in how digital restorations are sent, likely indicating adoption changes or differences in practice behaviors among practitioners. the image contains a chart titled \"percentage of surgeries - whole sample.\" this chart provides the penetration of different channels in the utilization of digital technology for surgeries, representing the entire sample surveyed. the chart includes four categories of digital technology providers and lists their respective percentage values for conducting surgeries, based on data from two different years: 2018 and the categories depicted on the x-axis are as follows: chairside milling partner-lab manufacturer / milling center non-users of digital technologies the y-axis does not correspond directly to the percentages but appears to align with different data points for the years 2018 and the data for each provider and category are the following: **chairside milling**: - 2015: 4% - 2018: 5% **partner-lab**: - increase in usage: 41% for the partner-lab is noted between 2015 and 2018, indicating that digital restoration is most commonly provided through these labs, with a significant number using chairside milling (5%). **manufacturer / milling center**: - the usage for manufacturer / milling centers was 12% in 2015, which increased to 16% by the time of the 2018 sample. this indicates a mild yet steady increase in their usage of digital technologies. **non-users of digital technologies**: - this category is split between two subcategories: - 57% in 2018 for \"partner-lab\" - 57% for \"non-users of digital technologies\", which suggests that a significant portion of digital surgeries are either performed in a partner-lab context or by entities not currently using digital technologies. the text within the document surrounding the chart notes there could be two percentage points of discrepancies for differences below +/- 2%, which are stated to be not statistically significant. the overall distribution illustrated suggests a significant reliance on partner-labs as the primary channel for providing digital restorations. this is visually shown via a prominent placement of the data in the partner-lab category for both years, with a particularly high representation in considering all this information, it is apparent that partner-labs have emerged as the dominant provider of digital restorations. the data also suggests a gradual transition within the industry toward higher adoption of digital technologies among various stakeholders.", "type": "Document"}}
