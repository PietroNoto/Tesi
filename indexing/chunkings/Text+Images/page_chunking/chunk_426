the first category (feeling uncomfortable) shows 63%. - the second category (using because needed but not comfortable) shows 30%. - the third category (closeness to digital technologies) shows 7%. scanner channel: - the first category (feeling uncomfortable) shows 54%. - the second category (using needed but not comfortable) shows 38%. - the third category (closeness to digital technologies) shows 8%. full outsourcing channel: - the first category (feeling uncomfortable) shows 51%. - the second category (using needed but not comfortable) shows 45%. - the third category (closeness to digital technologies) shows 4%. the fourth bar at the bottom represents the manufacturer channel: - the first category (feeling uncomfortable) shows 46%. - the second category (using needed but not comfortable) shows 38%. - the third category (closeness to digital technologies) shows 16%. below the bar graph, different perspectives of response are color-coded and include: uncomfortable blue using needed but uncomfortable light blue getting closer light blue using comfortable dark blue these responses provide insightful data on how users attitudes towards digital technologies vary across different industries and channels, indicating a general apprehension but a gradual acceptance and adaptability towards digital advancements. the image contains a pie chart that illustrates the stance of different channel groups on the adoption of digital technologies. this data follows the same format as the pie chart presented on page 24 in the referenced material, showing the stance of different categories in relation to digital technologies. the pie chart is divided into four distinct sections, each representing a different channel group: digital restorations provider, inhouse milling channel, scanning technology channel, full outsourcing channel, partner-lab channel, and manufacturer channel. 1. **digital restorations provider (dark blue section)** - this section represents 20% of the pie, suggesting that 20% of the respondents identified with this channel and feel more comfortable with digital technologies. this percentage is higher compared to the inhouse milling channel (10%). 2. **inhouse milling channel (navy blue section)** - this portion, constituting 10% of the pie, indicates that 10% of the respondents feel more comfortable with digital technologies and are currently using digital technologies through this channel. 3. **scanning technology channel (light blue section)** - making up 35% of the pie, this segment signifies that 35% of respondents are using digital technologies because they need them for better performance, suggesting a higher propensity for digital technology adoption in this category. 4. **full outsourcing channel (turquoise section)** - represented by 36% of the pie chart, this segment shows that 36% of respondents are getting closer to digital technologies because they believe digital technologies are the future of prosthetics and that such technologies are becoming more comfortable for them. 5. **partner-lab channel (dark blue section)** - this portion is the smallest, with 2% of the pie, indicating that only 2% of respondents are using digital technologies more comfortably than others through the partner-lab channel. 6. **manufacturer channel (light blue section)** - this segment, covering 1%, suggests that just 1% of respondents are feeling more comfortable with digital technologies and are using them within the manufacturer channel. overall, this pie chart visually conveys the varied degrees of comfort and usage of digital technologies by different channel groups. it emphasizes that 36% of respondents (in the full outsourcing channel) feel more comfortable with digital technologies and find them a necessity. additionally, the note indicates that the differences between 0-2% are not statistically relevant, though those percentages exist. the image contains a stacked bar chart that details the perceptions of various industry channels in relation to digital restorations. the chart is divided into four segments, representing different responses: \"yes\" (blue), \"no\" (navy blue), \"inhouse milling\" (gray), and \"scanning technology\" (light blue). additionally, the channels listed from top to bottom are: \"digital restoration provider,\" \"in-house milling,\" \"scanning technology,\" \"full outsourcing,\" \"partner-lab,\" and \"manufacturer.\" for \"digital restoration provider,\" the distribution of responses is as follows: yes: 54% no: 63% inhouse milling: 26% scanning technology: 7% the \"yes\" segment shows a significant majority in favor of digital restorations, while the \"no\" segment has a lesser percentage and a higher percentage indicating inhouse milling and scanning technology. for \"in-house milling,\" the distribution of responses is: yes: 36% no: 30% inhouse milling: 51% scanning technology: 16% again, the \"no\" response is marked with the highest percentage, indicating a resistance to digital restorations, while \"inhouse milling\" is preferred more than \"scanning technology.\" for \"scanning technology,\" the response distribution is: yes: 51% no: 46% inhouse milling: 38% scanning technology: 6% here, the \"no\" segment is once more the highest, followed closely by the \"yes\" segment, with a significant preference leaning towards inhouse milling and a minimal preference for scanning technology. for \"full outsourcing,\" the response distribution is: yes: 38% no: 51% inhouse milling: 38% scanning technology: 6% full outsourcing also shows a larger \"no\" response, indicating resistance to this method, with scanning technology having the least percentage. lastly, for \"partner-lab,\" the response distribution is: yes: 42% no: 38% inhouse milling: 40% scanning technology: 28% in this segment, the \"yes\" response is higher than in the first segment, but the \"no\" response is still the most common, with inhouse milling and scanning technology also being popular options. finally, for \"manufacturer,\" the response distribution is: yes: 47% no: 33% inhouse milling: 38% scanning technology: 6% in this segment, the \"yes\" response is the highest, indicating a preference for digital restorations, while inhouse milling and scanning technology are also significant options. each segment includes small annotations beneath each colored bar segment, with shades of blue, navy blue, and gray bars depicting different answer categories (yes, no, inhouse milling, scanning technology). the visual representation helps visualize how each industry channel perceives and values different methods related to digital restorations.", "type": "Document"}}
