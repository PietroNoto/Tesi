**2015:** - 38% of dentists believe that they can \"acquire technician skills.\" - 36% anticipate an increase in cooperation between dentists and technicians. - 27% expect more expertise about prosthetics from technicians due to the involvement of digital technologies. - 18% feel the dentist's role will not change at all. - **2018:** - 41% of dentists believe they can \"acquire technician skills.\" - 37% anticipate the level of cooperation between dentists and technicians will increase. - 21% expect more expertise about prosthetics by technicians. - 19% feel the dentist's role will not change at all. 2. **laboratories:** - **2015:** - 38% of technicians believe dentists could \"acquire technician skills.\" - 57% anticipate an increase in cooperation between dentists and technicians. - 52% expect more expertise about prosthetics by dentists in response to digital technologies. - 27% think the technician's role will not change at all. - **2018:** - 41% of technicians believe dentists could \"acquire technician skills.\" - 61% anticipate further increase in cooperation between dentists and technicians. - 45% expect more expertise about prosthetics by dentists. - 28% think the technicians role will not change at all. the chart reflects changes in the perceptions and expectations of dentists and technicians in terms of skills acquisition, cooperation, and expertise across these two years. the data indicates a slight increase in confidence levels among dentists and technicians that digital technologies will facilitate a more collaborative environment in the dental practices' and laboratories' sectors. additionally, the overall confidence levels in the dentist's role remaining static dropped slightly in both fields from 18% and 27% in 2015 to 19% and 28% in however, the trend shows an overall optimism about technological advancements improving the dentist-technician relationship, especially with 46% of chairside owners showing some overlap between clinical and laboratory phases, further accentuating the impact of digital technologies on these partnerships. the image contains a set of three statements summarizing the textual content found in image- specifically, the statements seem to be simplified summaries of the findings or predictions made by dentists regarding their future roles with the advent of new digital technologies. the first bullet states that dentists will need to increase their expertise about prosthetics because they will be required to take over part of that work from technicians. the second bullet discusses an increase in cooperation between dentists and technicians due to the critical knowledge required by technicians across different fields like prosthetics materials, esthetics, and digital processing. the third bullet suggests that there will not be substantial changes as everyone will always have their distinct roles. these statements are directly cited from the detailed data and analysis presented in image-1, offering a simplified version of the original content for a quick reference or explanation.", "type": "Document"}}
