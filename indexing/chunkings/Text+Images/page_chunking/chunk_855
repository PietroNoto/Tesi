(4%). 3d printing seems to be more widely used among less young dentists and big sized surgeries. base: 282 cases (whole sample) the image contains a pie chart with sections representing different percentages related to 3d printing awareness and use in dentistry. there are four main sections, each color-coded and labeled with corresponding percentages: 1. **deep blue section (48%):** this largest section, shaded in a deep blue, denotes \"we use 3d printing at our practice.\" it represents the highest percentage of respondents who have implemented 3d printing in their dental practices. 2. **light blue section (47%):** the next major section, in a lighter blue, represents \"i am familiar with its benefits and uses, but never tried it (awareness).\" this section indicates that respondents understand the potential of 3d printing but have not yet utilized it in their practices. 3. **gray section (4%):** this smaller section, shaded in gray, states \"i am aware of 3d printing, but not familiar with its benefits and uses (awareness).\" this represents a small group of respondents who are generally aware of 3d printing but lack specific knowledge about its applications in dentistry. 4. **very slight blue section (1%):** the smallest section, shaded in a very light blue, indicates \"never heard of it.\" this portion signifies a small fraction of respondents who are not aware of 3d printing at all. on the right side of the pie chart, there is a vertical percentage scale showing that 1% own a 3d printer in their surgeries, specifically noted for young dentists and bigger surgeries. furthermore, the text accompanying the pie chart highlights various points: despite some practices providing customized devices made from 3d printers, only 1% own their own. among 3d printing technology, only 4% of respondents declare to be aware of it. young dentists and larger surgeries report more frequently the usage of 3d printing. the base note at the bottom left of the image states, \"base: 282 cases (whole sample),\" suggesting that the survey includes all respondent cases, totaling the overall layout is neat and clean, with the text providing clear context about the usage statistics of 3d printing in dentistry. the image contains a smaller inset chart located towards the bottom of the larger data visualization page, which appears to be a part of a report or presentation on 3d printing awareness and usage. the inset chart utilizes a pie chart to illustrate a group of responses related to the adoption and familiarity with 3d printing in a dental practice setting. each segment of the pie chart corresponds to a specific category, represented by distinct colors. **we use 3d printing at our practice**: this is shown in blue, constituting 48% of the pie chart. **i am familiar with its benefits and uses, but never tried it (awareness)**: represented in light blue, this category comprises 47% of the total. **i am aware of 3d printing, but not familiar with its benefits and uses (awareness)**: indicated in grey, accounts for 4% of the pie chart. **never heard of it**: shown in dark blue, this segment makes up the remaining 1%. below the pie chart is a bracket that provides a visual representation of the percentage figures, aligning with the segments of the pie and confirming the data percentages. adjacent to the pie chart is a brief explanatory note regarding the data. the note reads as follows: \"despite quite some practices providing customized devices made up from 3d printers (as shown in the following slide), only 1% declare to own a 3d printer in the surgery. rather new but rapidly increasing, 3d printing looks to be well know as to be a digital technology available for dentistry as well: only a very small portion of the respondents declare not to be aware of it (4%), 3d printing seems to be more widely used among less young dentists and big sized surgeries.\" this summary provides an insight that suggests while 1% have a 3d printer, there is a broad awareness (96% aware and 4% unaware of 3d printing) among the dental practitioners, which underscores the rapid uptake of the technology. it further highlights a possible generational trend where 3d printing is more prevalent among older practitioners and larger surgical practices. to the right of the chart, a legend in text format specifies the color code associated with each segment of the pie chart for reader reference. this includes: **1% owners** (denotes the light blue segment) **99% non-owners** (denotes the dark blue segment) this concise inclusion offers an at-a-glance understanding of 3d printing adoption and awareness levels in dental practices. the source and base sample number is cited below the pie chart, indicating 282 cases, which suggests the data spans a large enough population to offer meaningful insights into dental practitioners' familiarity and usage of 3d printing. *concluding observation**: the image, as a whole, thus portrays a snapshot of the rapid technological adoption in dentistry, notably the early stages of integrating 3d printing into dental practices, reflected by the significant awareness levels but a notably lesser share who can claim having a printing device, with a hint at its growing influence especially among a specialized demographic within the dental field.", "type": "Document"}}
