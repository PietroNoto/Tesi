difference from mean level of satisfaction by brand on the factors resulting from the factor analysis. + satisfaction level 108 the displayed values represent the satisfaction level of those factors, with a value ranging from -1 to +1 where 0 represents the overall mean value. for each investigated factor, the horizontal bars represent how much the satisfaction performance differs from the overall mean (vertical axis). the significant differences from the mean are marked with a red circle, so that it is possible to focus on the most interesting topics. with this regard, it is worth to note the higher than average performance of amann girrbach regarding the factor relationship and support, while it is significant the below average performance of 3shape and dental wings in the factor operating costs. the image contains a bar chart that captures the difference in satisfaction with the factors resulting from a factor analysis across different brands. the chart specifically shows the comparisons between three different brands: open technologies, 3shape, and amann girbach. there are three colors represented on the chart: green (representing performance), yellow (indicating relationship and support), and purple (depicting operating costs). the x-axis of the bar chart is labeled with the brand names open technologies, 3shape, and amann girbach while the y-axis illustrates the factors evaluated, including open technologies, 3shape, and amann girbach. the height of each bar within a given brand signifies the satisfaction level that differs from the overall mean, with the horizontal bars indicating how much the satisfaction of each factor varies from the overall mean. by observing each brand, we see several key details: 1. **open technologies**: - performance has a relatively high satisfaction value (above the midpoint). - relationship and support has a low satisfaction (beneath the bottom half), indicated by the green bar which reaches deeper compared to the others. - operating costs have a satisfyingly lower level, close to the negative axis boundary (purple). 2. **3shape**: - again, performance (green bar) shows a higher satisfaction compared to the others for this brand. - relationship and support are lower, like with open technologies, but it shows a slight higher trend from the previous brand. - operating costs are again near the bottom but better than open technologies. 3. **amann girbach**: - performance shows a high satisfaction level comparable to 3shape and open technologies. - relationship and support are the lowest among all brands and categories, even lower than open technologies and 3shape. - operating costs reach a higher point than open technologies and 3shape. the visual representation helps to see the relative strengths and weaknesses of each brands factors in customer satisfaction. specifically, while performance factors are relatively higher across the board, amann girbach has the poorest performance in the factor of relationship and support, pointing to areas for improvement in this category for this brand. the image contains a bar chart titled overall satisfaction: factor analysis difference from mean which visualizes the level of satisfaction by brand on the factors resulting from the factor analysis. the chart on the page specifies three main factors that contribute to brand satisfaction, indicated by different colors: 1. **performance**: represented by the purple bars. 2. **relationship and support**: represented by the green bars. 3. **operating costs**: represented by the orange bars. each brand's satisfaction level for these factors is depicted through horizontal bars. for example, \"open technologies\" is illustrated with one horizontal bar for each factor, measuring how much they perform in relation to the overall mean. the mean is indicated along the vertical axis with the overall mean value set at values above 0 signify a difference from the mean above the zero line, and values below 0 are below the zero line. key points from the bar chart include: amann girrbach is noted to have a higher than average performance regarding the factor relationship and support, while having sub-average performance in operating costs. 3shape and dental wings show positive performance differences above the mean but vary differently across the factors. overall, the chart aims to provide a visual comparative analysis of how closely each brands satisfaction levels match or diverge from the mean, with specific attention directed towards the most pressing or interesting areas. additionally, the image includes a legend in the bottom left corner to distinguish the different factors: **performance**: purple **relationship and support**: green **operating costs**: orange annotations, such as highlighted red circles showing significant differences from the mean, also help emphasize notable trends and insights. overall, this visual report aids in highlighting distinct brand performance strengths and weaknesses regarding satisfaction through a clear, color-coded bar chart presentation.", "type": "Document"}}
