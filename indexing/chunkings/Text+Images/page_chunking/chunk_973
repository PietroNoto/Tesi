(scores from 1 completely unsatisfied to 10 completely satisfied) open technologies overall open technologies (50 quotes) mean 80 overall brands (538 quotes) the image contains a section of a two-dimensional bar chart titled \"satisfaction score: overall brands vs. open technologies.\" it compares user satisfaction scores from two groups: users of overall brands and users of open technologies. the chart is segmented into two columns: one for overall brands and another for open technologies, each with detailed responses from 538 overall brand users and 50 open technology users. satisfaction is evaluated on a scale from 1 to 10, with five rating categories: \"i can not judge,\" \"not satisfied,\" \"rather satisfied,\" \"very satisfied,\" and \"open technologies\" as a separate category. the chart is visually divided into two main sections, each showing 13 different aspects on which satisfaction is measured. the aspects listed from left to right are: makes daily practice easier accuracy and overall quality of the restorations reliability productivity increase handiness/ease of use technical support from the company wide-range of procedures available wide range of materials available company availability and flexibility technical assistance in case of repair compatibility with other brands overall running costs start-up training business development support frequency of sw updates from the company cost of sw updates overall satisfaction each aspect is represented by a horizontal bar for both the overall brand users and open technology users. the lengths of the bars indicate the percentage of users who rated their satisfaction in each category. the colors vary from dark to light to represent different satisfaction levels: dark represents \"very satisfied,\" medium represents \"rather satisfied,\" and light represents \"not satisfied.\" the colors are as follows: dark yellow/gold for \"very satisfied\" light orange for \"rather satisfied\" pale yellow for \"not satisfied\" the overall satisfaction score is displayed as a circular chart at the bottom with the mean scores of open technologies and the overall average, showing that the mean satisfaction score is 7.9 for open technology users and averaged overall is 7. here is a detailed breakdown of the chart for the aspects: **makes daily practice easier**: both overall brand (29% very satisfied, 44% rather satisfied) and open technology (41% very satisfied, 36% rather satisfied) respondents reported a fairly high level of satisfaction. **accuracy and overall quality of the restorations**: lower satisfaction here, particularly for open technology users. **reliability**: similarly, lower satisfaction, with open technology users reporting slightly higher satisfaction. **productivity increase**: both groups report a moderate level of satisfaction. **handiness/ease of use**: both groups report high levels of satisfaction. **technical support from the company**: open technology users report much lower satisfaction compared to overall brands. **wide range of procedures available**: overall brands and open technologies report similar levels of satisfaction. **wide range of materials available**: open technology users report slightly higher satisfaction. **company availability and flexibility**: both users report a higher level of satisfaction. **technical assistance in case of repair**: slightly varying but overall slightly higher for open technology users. **compatibility with other brands**: overall brand users report significantly higher satisfaction. **overall running costs**: open technology users report higher overall satisfaction. **start-up training**: again, higher satisfaction for open technology users. **business development support**: overall brand users report a substantial increase. **frequency of sw updates from the company**: both groups report quite similar rates of satisfaction for having software updates. **cost of sw updates**: open technology users express higher levels of satisfaction compared to overall brands. **overall satisfaction**: mean score for open technologies is slightly higher than the overall average. each individual aspects bars are plotted in a visually engaging layout, allowing a clear comparison between the satisfaction levels of users under both categories, which is intended to provide insightful data points that can be utilized for further analysis and decision-making. the image shows a circular diagram representing a graph or a bar plot, but the representation is peculiar and somewhat artistic. each 'bar' seems to be composed of multiple circular elements arranged around a central point forming a ring. each of these circles has a numerical value labeled next to it, ranging from 6.1 to 8.1, depicted in different shades of blue and gray. the circles appear to be densely packed and are layered, implying perhaps variations or categories within each individual data point. the arrangement and design is visually complex and modernistic, contributing to a clear understanding of the data distribution presented. the image contains two main sections labeled \"overall brands\" and \"open technologies,\" with each detailing percentages that represent user satisfaction scores about different factors related to cad-cam brands. each section is accompanied by a legend that maps color coding to different degrees of satisfaction. under \"overall brands,\" there are 538 quotes with ratings ranging from 'not satisfied' at 0% to 'very satisfied' at 43%. the percentages across all factors are generally higher across all categories except in a few areas where ratios are closer to the middle of the spectrum. under \"open technologies,\" there are 50 quotes with ratings similarly ranging from 'not satisfied' to 'very satisfied,' though the ratios appear generally higher for the \"open technologies\" category across several factors compared to \"overall brands.\" the highest satisfaction percentages in this section are also reflected in the overall mean scores provided at the bottom of the image. each factor is detailed and ranked with percentage scores, illustrating elements such as the ease of daily practice, the accuracy of restorations, reliability, productivity increase,-handiness, technical support, range of procedures and materials, company flexibility, technical assistance in repair, compatibility with other brands, overall running costs, startup training, business development support, frequency of sw updates, cost of sw updates, and overall satisfaction. the scores reflect the user experience and satisfaction with these different facets offered by both brand names.", "type":
