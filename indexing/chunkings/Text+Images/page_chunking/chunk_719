score: focus on 'completely satisfied' - difference from mean.\" the chart is visually represented in green and red bars, showing the percentage values for various components of satisfaction. the bars are grouped into four categories: overall (365 quotes), open technologies (42 quotes), 3shape (31 quotes), dental wings (28 quotes), and amann girrbach (25 quotes). the specific categories listed in the chart along the left side are: accuracy and overall quality of the restorations reliability wide range of materials available wide range of procedures available makes daily practice easier handiness / ease of use technical assistance in case of repair technical support from the company productivity increase compatibility with other brands company availability and flexibility overall running costs start-up training frequency of sw updates from the company cost of sw updates business development support overall satisfaction each category is paired with a corresponding progress bar in green or red. the green portions represent the percentage of survey respondents who are 'completely satisfied' with that specific aspect, and the red portions represent the percentage lower than the 'completely satisfied' average as per the mean. **accuracy and overall quality of the restorations** have a percentage of satisfaction among all categories. **reliability** shows 9% completely satisfied and 5% in the red bar. **wide range of materials available** has 7% completely satisfied and a slight negative. **wide range of procedures available** shows a very slight positive. **makes daily practice easier** is represented well with only 3% in the red bar. **handiness / ease of use** is 3% 'completely satisfied.' **technical assistance in case of repair** has -1% completely satisfied. **technical support from the company** shows 5% 'completely satisfied.' **productivity increase** shows a slight negative. **compatibility with other brands** has 6% 'completely satisfied.' **company availability and flexibility** shows a positive, though lower. **overall running costs** has 6% completely satisfied and also presents negative red values. **start-up training** is 6% completely satisfied. **frequency of sw updates from the company** shows 7% 'completely satisfied.' **cost of sw updates** has 7% 'completely satisfied.' **business development support** shows a significant -16% completely satisfied, highlighted in red. **overall satisfaction** shows a slight negative. the chart provides a clear visual representation of the strengths and areas in need of improvement as perceived by survey respondents, offering insightful data for understanding user satisfaction. the image contains a detailed satisfaction score bar chart illustrating the \"difference from mean\" for four different software companies: open technologies, 3shape, dental wings, and amann girrbach. the bar chart is accompanied by a list of satisfaction metrics on the left side, detailing criteria such as \"accuracy and overall quality of the restorations,\" \"reliability,\" and \"wide range of materials available\" among others. ### metrics list in the first image: accuracy and overall quality of the restorations reliability wide range of materials available wide range of procedures available makes daily practice easier handiness / ease of use technical assistance in case of repair technical support from the company productivity increase compatibility with other brands company availability and flexibility overall running costs start-up training frequency of sw updates from the company cost of sw updates business development support overall satisfaction ### detailed description of the second image: the bar chart is divided into two vertical columns: **positive response (green bars):** indicate characteristics perceived positively by users. **negative response (red bars):** indicate characteristics that users found unsatisfactory. for each company, the metrics are evaluated and represented by their respective green and red colored percentage values. the specific percentages show how each company stacks up against the mean satisfaction level for these metrics. here is a breakdown of each companys results: 1. **open technologies (42 quotes)** - positive: approx. 12% (wide range of materials available) - negative: approx. 0% to -2% (reliability, wide range of procedures available, among others) - the chart indicates mixed feedback, with a slightly higher trend towards positive aspects. 2. **3shape (31 quotes)** - positive: approx. 9% (wide range of materials available, wide range of procedures available) - negative: approx. 0% (company availability and flexibility, among others) and a moderate trend of negative feedback (approx. -5%). 3. **dental wings (28 quotes)** - positive: approx. 11% (frequency of sw updates from the company) - negative: approx. -7% (wider range of materials available, reliability, among others) - the results indicate a predominantly negative trend overall with less positive aspects. 4. **amann girrbach (25 quotes)** - positive: approx. 9% (company availability and flexibility) - negative: approx. 14% (accuracy and overall quality of the restorations, among others) - indicates the highest unfavorable rating among the listed metrics and a relatively low percentage of positive aspects. these percentages provide a quick visual assessment of user satisfaction levels concerning different aspects of each company's software. the visual representation and numerical accuracy help to identify areas where each company excels or falls short in comparison to user expectations, enhancing the understanding of user feedback patterns and potential areas for improvement. the image contains a section of a bar chart included within another larger chart. the primary chart in view is divided into columns labeled as \"overall,\" \"open technologies,\" \"3shape,\" \"dental wings,\" and \"amann girbach,\" along with a total number of quotes attributed to each (365 for overall, 42 for open technologies, 31 for 3shape, 28 for dental wings, and 25 for amann girbach). this section focuses on satisfaction scores based on a satisfaction survey where respondents rated each factor. the second image within the larger chart represents a specific factor \"openness.\" this particular factor is highlighted by its position on the vertical axis, and within each column under the aforementioned labels and quote numbers, numerical values in green and red are displayed. the bar for \"overall\" shows an average satisfaction score of 11%, with a margin of error indicated by the green color scheme. this implies that a minority of participants reported a high level (green) of satisfaction regarding the factor of openness, while the majority found it to be a less favorable aspect (red). for \"open technologies,\" the satisfaction score for openness is represented as 0%, highlighting that this section did not receive satisfaction from respondents regarding this factor, hence it is indicated in red. \"3shape\" has a green score of 9%, which suggests moderate satisfaction related to openness. \"dental wings\" shows a slight red margin of error around 1%, indicating only a slight negative perception regarding openness. lastly, \"amann girbach\" has 0% satisfaction in green, denoting a lack of positive feedback on openness. this data likely aims to inform stakeholders about the specific aspect of openness and its perceived quality across different technology companies as viewed by the respondents. the second image is an infographic segment that is embedded within the first image. this specific infographic focuses on a detailed analysis of \"satisfaction score: focus on 'completely satisfied'\" from an evaluation. below is a vivid description of its content: *title and overview:** the image is titled \"satisfaction score: focus on 'completely satisfied'\" and is part of a larger study or survey analysis. it is part of the labo segment of the report compiled by omnivision digital. *graph title and data:** the graph itself is a bar chart labeled with \"difference from mean,\" highlighting the percentage differences in satisfaction scores compared to the mean value. *y-axis and labels:** the y-axis is labeled and enumerated with percentages ranging from 18% to 9%. each point on the y-axis represents a specific percentage difference from the average. *color coding:** green bars represent positive differences (exceeding the mean) while red bars indicate negative differences (lower than the mean). *data points and trends:** \"dental wings\" has a 14% difference, represented by a green bar. \"3shane\" has a 9% difference, also in green. \"amann girbach\" exhibits a 12% positive change in satisfaction, shown by an adjacent green bar. \"key-stone\" demonstrates a 12% positive difference in blue bars. the majority of other categories display negative differences with red bars, such as \"-2%, -7%, -18%,\" and so forth, indicating overall lower satisfaction levels. *analysis and interpretation:** based on the data above, one can infer that a few brands have significantly higher customer satisfaction rates compared to the average ('completely satisfied') as highlighted by green bars. conversely, a large number of brands are scoring lower, evident by the red bars suggesting dissatisfaction. *relevance to the first image:** within the larger context of the first image, this specific segment delves into the detailed performance of these brands in terms of customer satisfaction metrics. the overall message from the first image serves to provide an in-depth understanding of how these brands stand in comparison to each other regarding customer satisfaction. in conclusion, this segment emphasizes the significant variance in customer satisfaction among the brands listed, shedding light on noteworthy performances and areas requiring potential improvements. the image contains a bar chart illustrating the differences between the actual satisfaction scores and the mean satisfaction scores provided by five different company options across various categories. the companies listed are open technologies, 3shape, dental wings, and amann girrbach. here's a detailed description of the content of the image: 1. **layout and structure:** - the bar chart is vertical, composed of two sets of bars per category. - the left vertical axis represents the difference in mean scores (where positive numbers show scores above the mean and negative numbers show scores below the mean). - the right vertical axis displays the actual satisfaction percentage scores for each company. - each category is aligned along the horizontal axis, with the number of quotes for each category marked above the bars for clarity. 2. **categories:** - the categories listed from top to bottom are: - accuracy and overall quality of the restorations - reliability - wide range of materials available - wide range of procedures available - makes daily practice easier - handiness/ease of use - technical assistance in case of repair - technical support from the company - productivity increase - compatibility with other brands - company availability and flexibility - overall running costs - start-up training - frequency of sw updates from the company - cost of sw updates - business development support - overall satisfaction 3. **company-specific analysis:** - **open technologies:** - the most significant negative deviations in 'business development support' (-29%), 'accuracy and overall quality of the restorations' (-17%), and 'wide range of materials available' (-15%). - positive deviations are seen in 'wide range of procedures available' (+12%) and 'overall satisfaction' (+6%). - **3shape:** - negative deviations are notable in 'start-up training' (-17%), 'productivity increase' (-11%), 'reliability' (-11%), and 'handiness/ease of use' (-11%). - a positive deviation is seen in 'wide range of procedures available' (+24%). - **dental wings:** - negative deviations are present in 'wide range of materials available' (-11%), 'accuracy and overall quality of the restorations' (-11%), 'reliability' (-11%). - no positive deviations are evident. - **amann girrbach:** - negative deviations can be observed in 'start-up training' (-28%), 'accuracy and overall quality of the restorations' (-15%), 'wide range of materials available' (-15%), 'reliability' (-15%), and 'overall satisfaction' (-11%). - the only positive deviation is a slight increase in 'wide range of procedures available' (+12%). 4. **colors and visual indicators:** - bars for positive deviations are indicated with green color. - bars for negative deviations are highlighted with red color. by combining the detailed analysis with the visual indicators, one can derive that open technologies and 3shape face the most significant areas of dissatisfaction, whereas dental wings generally maintains relatively stable user satisfaction scores with minimal deviations from the mean. amann girrbach is seen struggling in multiple areas, showing consistent negative deviations.", "type": "Document"}}
