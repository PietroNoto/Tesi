27 the penetration of the milling center in dental practices is rather low, but it is worth to underline that in germany this penetration of milling units is historically higher due to the presence of the so called practice lab. for both uk and germany, the higher presence of dentsply sirona make the penetration of this equipment higher than average. most of the installed equipment is rather old, with a slowdown in purchases in 2018 and 2019 and a subsequent growth in recent years (2020-2021). given the low sample base, the information is featured by a high statistical error, so it is recommended to use the information as a qualitative indication only. year of purchase average: 2016 clinic base: 1.061 cases germany france italy spain uk yes, and we use it often 12% 6% 6% 2% 8% yes,

201 180 the image contains a pie chart that displays the age distribution of purchases of the chairside milling system, based on an average purchase year of here is a detailed analysis of the content within the image: the pie chart is divided into five sections, each representing a different time period, quantified as percentages: 1. **up to 2017**: this section takes up the largest portion of the pie chart, representing 54% of the chart. it indicates that a majority of the purchased units have an age group up to and including 2017. 2. **2018**: the 2018 purchases constitute 14% of the chart, making this group a smaller yet significant portion compared to the previous year. 3. **2019**: with 10% of the pie chart, the 2019 purchases are less common than those from 2018 but more than those from 2020 and beyond. 4. **2020**: this section represents the least significant group, accounting for 7% of the chart. 5. **2021 and beyond**: the smallest segment, comprising just 10% of the pie chart, represents the year 2021 and later purchases. overall, the data reveals that a substantial number of the milling systems are relatively older, with purchases mainly made before 2019, indicative of slower adoption at the beginning of the time frame followed by a period of increased interest culminating in the years post- the image contains a pie chart and a bar graph providing statistical data on the years of purchase within a specific sample base. the pie chart, titled \"year of purchase average: 2016,\" divides the data based on the years of equipment purchases and their proportionate distribution. the chart segments include \"up to 2017,\" represented by the largest portion at 54%, followed by \"2018\" at 16%, \"2019\" at 14%, and \"2020\" at 7%, with the smallest section labeled \"2021\" at 7%. each segment is differentiated in shades of blue. on the left side within the image is a pie chart, colored differently with various pie slices representing different responses to survey questions about the adoption of a chairside milling system in a dental practice. the slices are labeled \"yes, and we use it often,\" \"yes, but we rarely use it,\" \"no, but we plan to buy it,\" \"no, and we dont plan to buy it,\" and \"no, and we don't know if we'll buy it,\" each with distinct colors showing their respective percentages, totaling 100%. to the right, there is a table with percentages reflecting the responses of dental practices in different european countries to similar questions regarding the adoption of chairside milling systems. the countries listed are germany with 72%, france with 74%, italy with 80%, spain with 82%, and the uk with 72%. furthermore, a paragraph beneath the pie chart provides insight into penetration rates, noting they are low, with special emphasis on germany's historically comparatively higher rate, attributed to the practice of using practice labs. the text advises the use of the provided data with caution due to a low sample size and a high statistical error, suggesting it should be regarded more as a qualitative indicator rather than a statistical one. the image contains a pie chart, which is a type of data visualization that represents data as slices of a circle or pie. this particular pie chart is segmented into five different sections, each representing a percentage. *description:** the pie chart is divided into five color-coded sections, with each section assigned a percentage value: the largest segment is brown and represents 77%, indicating that the majority of the data or responses fall within this category. the second-largest segment is tan-colored and accounts for 12%, indicating a significant but lesser amount compared to the first section. the next is a small grey segment totaling 8%, signifying a moderate portion. there are two equal-sized sections each in a light blue color, accounting for 2% of the total pie chart. *contextual details:** given the first image providing a broader context on dental practice penetration regarding chairside milling systems, we can infer that the pie chart from the second image is likely detailing the distribution of responses or data within a specific category discussed in those dentistry practice inquiries. for example, it could show the distribution of dentists' responses on whether they use, rarely use, plan to buy, or do not know about chairside milling systems, as indicated in the first image. *implications and interpretation:** the dominating 77% likely refers to a majority of respondents who are either confirming that they use this technology often or have chosen not to buy. 12% indicates a significant number who rarely use the technology or are unsure. the smaller 8% and 2% indicate minority groups who possibly do not use it at all or are in an undecided state. given the first images mention of regional differences, one can further interpret this pie chart by considering where these percentage points lie, potentially delineating further demographic trends and preferences among different countries or regions like germany, france, italy, spain, and the uk. this pie chart helps visualize the distribution clearly and allows for a quick understanding of how the data points are spread. the specific context of this data would be better understood when correlated with the broader categories and detailed data given in the first image. the image contains a venn diagram with five colored segments, each representing responses from a survey on the usage or potential purchase of chairside milling systems in different regions, namely germany, france, italy, spain, and the uk. the colored segments are as follows: **blue**: \"yes, and we use it often\" (indicating that respondents in these regions have regular use of chairside milling systems for dental practices). **grey**: \"yes, but we rarely use it\" (indicating that respondents in these regions use chairside milling systems infrequently). **purple**: \"no, but we plan to buy it\" (indicating that respondents from these regions intend to purchase chairside milling systems in the future but currently do not use them). **brown**: \"no, and we dont plan to buy it\" (indicating that respondents from these regions have no intent or plan to purchase chairside milling systems). **yellow**: \"no, and we dont know if we will buy it\" (indicating that respondents from these regions are uncertain about purchasing chairside milling systems). the surrounding text in the image provides an overview of the penetration levels of chairside milling systems in dental practices in different european countries, noting that the use is relatively low in most cases, but slightly higher in germany. it also provides a brief explanation concerning the influence of certain factors, such as the \"practice lab\" and the presence of dentsply sirona, which might affect the adoption rates of chairside milling equipment. furthermore, the image suggests that most installed equipment is older and that there has been a slowdown in purchases between 2018 and 2019, with subsequent increases in recent years until 2020- the statistical sample sizes, represented by actual numbers next to each response category, help indicate the proportion of each regional response. moreover, the image displays a section about the average year of purchase and a pie chart illustrating the distribution of responses over time. the pie chart reveals: **orange**: about 7% of respondents purchased between 2015 and 2017. **light blue**: about 14% of respondents purchased in 2018. **dark blue**: about 54% of respondents purchased in 2019. **grey**: about 16% of respondents purchased in 2020. **light grey**: about 10% of respondents purchased in 2021.", "type": "Document"}}
