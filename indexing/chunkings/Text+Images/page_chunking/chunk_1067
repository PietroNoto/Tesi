gc in your opinion, how do you rate the mentioned brands in the following areas? 54 mean gc (95 quotes) (scores: 1 totally irrelevant, 2 partially irrelevant, 3 neutral, 4 quite relevant, 5 totally relevant) all brands (1.142 quotes) the image contains a data visualization represented by a bar graph comparing \"brand image\" for \"all brands\" versus \"gc\". the graph uses two sets of colored bars to depict this comparison. the numerical mean values are displayed in a descending stack format, with the top indicating the highest values and the bottom being the lowest. each bar represents a different aspect of brand image with scores ranging from 1 to 5, indicating the level of importance of the aspect considered. the aspects considered include having a high reputation, product quality, being a long-term tradition, ease of use, company trust over others, innovation search, customer orientation, friendship, and business development support. the mean values are visually represented by colored dots connected by lines indicating the comparison between all brands and gc as per the context. the graph is titled \"brand image: focus on brands - gc\", indicating that it specifically concentrates on brand focus with an emphasis on general collaboration (gc). the legend below clarifies the scoring system, with colors representing \"totally irrelevant\", \"partially irrelevant\", \"neutral\", \"quite relevant\", and \"totally relevant\". the bars are color-coded: light pink for \"all brands\" and dark blue for \"gc\". each bar spans horizontally and is divided to denote the range of scores for each aspect. the highest score is indicated on the left side of each bar (for \"all brands\") and the corresponding mean value on the right side (for gc). the graph itself is segmented into areas concerning brand attributes and their scores, offering a comparative perspective on how distinct brands and gc meet these criteria. the horizontal positioning shows that in each compared area, gc either matches or surpasses the mean score of all brands in some aspects. this comparative format allows for a detailed look at the strengths and perceived qualities of the brand gc when juxtaposed with more widespread brands. the image contains a section from a larger document, specifically page 54, which features a comparative analysis of brand image perceptions. the image lists a series of statements about brand image, each paired with corresponding statistical data to illustrate how consumers rate these attributes based on their recognition of certain companies. the statements on the page include: 1. \"this company has a high reputation.\" 2. \"this company has products with the highest quality.\" 3. \"this company has a long-time tradition.\" 4. \"the products of this company are the easiest to use.\" 5. \"i trust this company more than others.\" 6. \"i think that it is the right company when i look for innovation.\" 7. \"i feel this company to be among the most customer-oriented ones.\" 8. \"i feel this company to be among the most familiar and friendly one.\" 9. \"this company supports my business development more than others.\" 10. \"the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio.\" adjacent to each statement, there are two colored blocks representing the ratings for different brand groups: the left block labeled \"all brands\" (based on 1,142 quotes) the right block labeled \"gc\" (based on 95 quotes), which likely refers to a specific company, given the context of the surrounding image. each statement has scores across a range from \"totally irrelevant\" (white) to \"totally relevant\" (red), with intermediate shades of orange and yellow indicating the degree of relevancy. green shades represent different levels of relevance. there are numerical values next to each block, reflecting the mean rating on a 5-point scale for the all brands and the gc group. for example: for \"this company has a high reputation,\" all brands mean 4.5 and gc mean 4. for \"the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio,\" all brands mean 4.2 and gc mean 3. at the bottom corners of the image: on the left, there is the logo \"brandequity clinic.\" on the right, there is the logo \"key-stone.\" the image contains a detailed statistical analysis of brand image perceptions as related to company focus, using a structured survey format. this specific segment of the visual content, known as \"image-2,\" is embedded within the larger image labeled \"image-1\" provided by the brande equity clinic. the core of the displayed information revolves around ratings attributed to various attributes of a companys brand image, where responses are depicted using color-coded categories that span from 'totally irrelevant' to 'totally relevant.' for instance, the first row in the table lists an attribute stating, \"this company has a high reputation,\" and the corresponding column details the total number of responses broken down by level of significance each attribute possesses. the column on the right is specifically labeled \"gc - (95 quotes)\" which likely stands for the company's products, given the \"all brands\" and \"gc\" labels on the sides of the table. breaking down these rows: **the company has a high reputation:** - totally irrelevant: 1% - partially irrelevant: 14% - neutral: 3% - quite relevant: 37% - totally relevant: 47% overall, 47% of respondents viewed the attribute as very relevant. **the company has the highest quality products:** - totally irrelevant: 1% - partially irrelevant: 20% - neutral: 17% - quite relevant: 42% - totally relevant: 43% this attribute also scored highly with 43% of respondents considering it entirely relevant. **the company has a long-time tradition:** - totally irrelevant: 1% - partially irrelevant: 12% - neutral: 17% - quite relevant: 36% - totally relevant: 43% 42% indicated a positive response to this. **the products of this company are the easiest to use:** - totally irrelevant: 2% - partially irrelevant: 22% - neutral: 27% - quite relevant: 25% - totally relevant: 26% **i trust this company more than others:** - totally irrelevant: 4% - partially irrelevant: 18% - neutral: 44% - quite relevant: 23% - totally relevant: 14% trust in the company sees moderate levels of relevance. **i think that it is the right company when i look for innovation:** - totally irrelevant: 4% - partially irrelevant: 18% - neutral: 44% - quite relevant: 23% - totally relevant: 14% similar to trust, the perception of innovation has moderate relevance. **i feel this company to be among the most customer-oriented ones:** - totally irrelevant: 7% - partially irrelevant: 22% - neutral: 31% - quite relevant: 34% - totally relevant: 22% a significant part rated it relevant. **i feel this company to be among the most familiar and friendly ones:** - totally irrelevant: 10% - partially irrelevant: 16% - neutral: 22% - quite relevant: 34% - totally relevant: 29% **this company supports my business development more than others:** - totally irrelevant: 11% - partially irrelevant: 8% - neutral: 37% - quite relevant: 34% - totally relevant: 28% **the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio:** - totally irrelevant: 18% - partially irrelevant: 12% - neutral: 14% - quite relevant: 37% - totally relevant: 36% each attribute of the company's brand image is assessed for relevance using these response categories, providing a comprehensive view of where the company stands in terms of perceived customer value and trust. the image contains a detailed statistical breakdown highlighting various brand attributes and the perception of a particular company. this information is based on responses from 95 quotes and is part of a broader analysis showing the brand image in terms of brand focus. the visual is segmented into two main sections: the left side titled \"all brands (1.142 quotes)\" and the right side titled \"gc (95 quotes),\" which presumably stands for a specific company denoted as gc. each section presents a bar graph with a range from 1 to 5, representing a scale from \"totally irrelevant\" to \"totally relevant.\" adjacent to each bar are horizontal bars representing different brand attributes, each color-coded to distinguish the relevance of the attribute: totally irrelevant (red) partially irrelevant (green) neutral (orange) quite relevant (yellow) totally relevant (blue) the attributes evaluated include product quality, trust, customer orientation, perceived business development support, and brand perception. each bar in the gc (95 quotes) section is shaded differently, with a specific focus on the right portion of the image compared to the larger sample of all brands. the gc scores are displayed vertically in a shaded bar graph at the bottom right, marked with dots representing points from 3.6 to 4.5, indicating a slightly higher mean relevance rating compared to the all brands average (4.5) for the specific company. for instance, the first attribute shown, \"this company has a high reputation,\" has: all brands: most respondents (around 60%) found it totally or quite relevant. gc: a slightly different response pattern, with a majority finding it totally relevant. the overall layout, color schemes, and comparative bars provide a comprehensive view, differentiating attributes and their relevance across both gc and the general population. the specific focus on the gc section, highlighted in colors and alignment, provides a clear comparison between the company's brand image perception and the broader market's perception of brand attributes.", "type": "Document"}}
