(low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) (low) satisfaction score (high) waste/inefficiency indifference prerequisites key success factors labo the image contains a correlation analysis map showing the overall satisfaction factors and their correlation with each other. the map highlights two key aspects, \"prerequisites\" and \"key success factors,\" which influence overall satisfaction. the horizontal axis represents the weight on overall satisfaction, indicating factors that contribute differently to satisfaction scores. on this axis, prerequisites are listed on the right, correlating with higher satisfaction, while success factors are listed towards the left, correlating with lower satisfaction. the vertical axis categorizes each factor based on its satisfaction score, displaying higher satisfaction at the top and lower satisfaction at the bottom. factors like \"accuracy and overall quality of the restorations,\" \"handliness / ease of use,\" \"broad range of materials available,\" and \"wide range of procedures available\" are marked in the \"prerequisites\" section at the right ends of the map, suggesting they are highly correlated with overall satisfaction. conversely, factors such as \"cost of sw updates,\" \"business development support,\" \"start-up training,\" \"overall running costs,\" and \"frequency of sw updates from the company\" are positioned towards the lower end of the map, indicating a lower correlation with overall satisfaction. each factor is color-coded and marked with a location on the map, showing the intensity of its correlation with satisfaction. the correlation is depicted through red dots, with higher dots closer to the top right of the map indicating greater significance and correlation with satisfaction. overall, the image emphasizes the balance between prerequisites, success factors, and their influence on user satisfaction.", "type": "Document"}}
