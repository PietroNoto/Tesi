background. the overall structure is linear, with nodes aligned horizontally and linked by straight-line connections. the lines are light blue, and the background of the graph is a plain, light gradient. starting from the left side, the first node is labeled \"3,1.\" the second node is labeled \"2,9.\" the third node is labeled \"3,1.\" the sequence continues to alternate between nodes labeled \"2,9\" and \"3,1\" interspersed by \"3,0\" and \"2,9\" values. following this pattern, there are several more nodes with the following labels: 3,1; 3,4; 3,1; 2,9; 3,4; 3,1; 3,0; 2,9; 2,9; and
