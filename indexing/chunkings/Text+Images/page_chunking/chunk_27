28 the factor analysis allows for a further data processing, where the items related to the recommendation are grouped into factors, thanks to a specific data processing. both factor analyses worked at their best when the output consisted in two factors, whose meaning and names have been the same for both groups. the first factor was nearness and the second one was reputation. even though the driving items are not exactly the same, both analysis may have the same meaning: nearness is the factor driven by items clearly related to the close relationship that a company may show, like customer service, affordability, reliability, while the second factor named reputation is made up of items in close relation to the image and reputation of a brand. chart brand positioning, factor analysis map - europe despite the factor analysis showed the same factors for both groups, the positioning maps had rather different results. the map of the dental practices sample was clearly influenced by the high weight of sirona in the analysis, whose position was in the middle of the map. a bit more scattered the map of the sample made up of dental laboratories. in the analysis on the laboratories, sirona has no central position and its brand image looks not to be related neither to the nearness, nor to the reputation. kavo brand image looks to be almost the same in both analysis, that is, more linked to the nearness and on average with regard to the reputation. other relevant topics worth to be mentioned are the position of dentsply in the analysis on the dental practices, very much related to the nearness, and the position of ivoclar vivadent in the analysis on the laboratories, which seems to be highly related to the reputation, just like zirkonzahn and, to a lesser extent, 3shape. the image contains a 2x2 matrix that categorizes the relationship between dental practices and laboratories in terms of \"repuation\" (left y-axis) and \"nearness\" (right y-axis) as part of a factor analysis map. the matrix is divided into four quadrants: 1. **top-left quadrant (\"more relevant, more relevant\")**: this section contains dots representing companies with significant relevance in both dental practices and laboratories. - firms like **sirona**, as well as **ivocar vivident** are located in this quadrant, indicating strong relevance in both contexts. 2. **top-right quadrant (\"less relevant, more relevant\")**: the companies found here have a higher relevance in laboratories but less in dental practices, often serving secondary roles or applications. - dots like **zirkonzahn** and possibly **3m** are situated here, indicating moderate importance in laboratories but are less central in dental practices' decision-making. 3. **bottom-right quadrant (\"less relevant, less relevant\")**: companies with low relevance in both domains are found in this section. - slightly off-cenred, possibly **dentsply**, signifies lower relevance in both dental practices and laboratories. 4. **bottom-left quadrant (\"more relevant, less relevant\")**: companies located in this area have significant relevance in dental practices but are less important in laboratories. - firms such as **kavo**, **amann girrbach** demonstrate this attribute, suggesting strong presence in practical dental environments but a lesser relevance in lab operations. the analysis further includes some brief explanatory text regarding the positioning within this matrix. it highlights specific companies within each quadrant and explains their relevance in terms of \"nearness\" and \"reputation.\" the positioning is described with contextual mentions of other brands like **carestream**, **sirona**, **siemens**, etc., indicating the complexity and strategic positioning within these industries. on the bottom right of the image is an axis labeled **\"nearness\"** which crosses and provides the visual separation for context. the left and right edges labeled more relevant and less relevant respectively align across the matrix for clearer interpretations. given the dual aspects of reputation and nearness, the image provides a strategic, comprehensive overview for companies operating across both dental practices and laboratories, helping in strategic planning and market positioning.", "type": "Document"}}
