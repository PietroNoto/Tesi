14 slightly less than 25% of practices do own an ios, with high intention to buy in spain, italy and france. also, it is worth to note the difference in the frequent use of the ios between aligners providers (25%) vs non providers (10%). in the countries where key-stone manages panels from the industry and distribution, there is a consistent growth in ios sales. we are now in the phase where both the number of users is steadily increasing and sales of additional machines in already digitalised practices are being recorded. the market is in a full development phase, with more than 20% of clinics already using ios, and penetration growing rapidly over time. when about half of the potential market (about 80% of clinics) is covered (i.e., about 40% of clinics is digitalised), the weight of sales of replacement units will start to increase (also taking into account that the average obsolescence of models is about 7 years). this moment will represent the trade-off of the market, which will develop at a slower pace with an increase in the weight of the software component on the total business. clinic base: 1.061 cases germany france italy spain uk yes, and we use it often 22% 17% 24% 20% 20% yes, but we rarely use it 7% 2% 3% 3% 7% no, but we plan to buy it 34% 44% 41% 53% 29% no, and we don't plan to buy it 36% 35% 32% 24% 44% no, and we don't know if we will buy it 1% 2% 1% cases 256 224 200 201 180 the image contains a pie chart titled \"intraoral scanner penetration\" and it is part of a page from a report detailed in the first image, which includes various insights related to dentistry and intraoral scanners. the pie chart specifically divides the penetration rate of intraoral scanners into five categories based on various responses from respondents. *detailed description of the pie chart:** the chart features five distinct sections, each representing different responses to a survey question regarding the use of intraoral scanners. the largest segment is brown and measures 40%, indicating that 40% of respondents either use an intraoral scanner often or rarely use it without any intent to buy one, suggesting low adoption. the blue section represents 21%, indicating 21% of respondents who use an intraoral scanner often. the tan section measures 34%, representing respondents who do not plan to buy an intraoral scanner. the sky blue section is smaller at 4%, indicating respondents who rarely use the scanner without planning to purchase one. the smallest segment is light grey and measures 1%, indicating respondents who are unsure about their future purchase. the first image provides more comprehensive information including country-specific data, detailed responses, and contextual notes on market behavior. the pie chart, particularly, visually summarizes key statistics regarding the frequency and intention of adoption among dental professionals, offering a concise yet informative snapshot. the image contains a pie chart depicting the penetration of introral scanners in various dental clinics. annotations around the pie chart indicate the percentage of clinics using these scanners frequently, infrequently, or not using them at all. below the pie chart, a list provides data breakdowns across different countries (germany, france, italy, spain, and the uk). additionally, statistical notes provide specific percentages for how often clinics use these scanners, with a detailed description highlighting market trends, industry growth, and projections for future sales of replacement units (cases). adjacent to the pie chart, on the right side of the first image, is the second image, which acts as an explanatory legend outlining the different categories used in the pie chart above. each quadrant of the legend is color-coded and aligns with the respective section of the pie chart. the legend is essential for interpreting the distribution of responses in the pie chart, explaining what each color represents: 1. \"yes, and we use it often\" (marked in blue) 2. \"yes, but we rarely use it\" (marked in darker blue) 3. \"no, but we plan to buy it\" (marked in orange) 4. \"no, and we dont plan to buy it\" (marked in light orange) 5. \"no, and we dont know if we will buy it\" (marked in yellow) the second image is crucial for quickly understanding the categorization scheme used in the pie chart, providing clarity for different responses related to the use of intraoral scanners in dental practices across the surveyed countries.", "type": "Document"}}
