please use a scale where 1 represents 'extremely unlikely' and 10 represents 'extremely likely.'\" **data presentation**: - the data shows the likelihood scores aggregated across different cad-cam companies: - **overall**: 31% detractor, 47% neutral, 22% advocate, with an average score of 7.3. - **sirona**: 29% detractor, 43% neutral, 28% advocate, with an average score of 7.6. - **kavo**: 26% detractor, 48% neutral, 26% advocate, with an average score of 7.7. - **3m**: 32% detractor, 57% neutral, 11% advocate, with an average score of 13.0. - **others**: 36% detractor, 47% neutral, 18% advocate, with an average score of 6.9. **note**: clarifies that the 10 possible answers have been clustered and notes on score categorization (detractor: 1-6, neutral: 7, advovate: 8-10). **brand advocacy score and implications**: - breakdowns of the \"advocates\" show that \"advocates\" share with neutrals, detractors, and neutral share similar percentage. - a notable point highlights that the brand overall subtacts the percent share to show net impact on word-of-mouth referrals. - neutral appears to have a higher volume, whereas \"detractors\" are relatively lower, though there's a significant difference between \"detrectors\" of sirona and kavo. - interesting points include the higher \"advocates\" percentage for kavo compared to sirona. - noted exceptions to the rule that \"detractors\" subtact \"advocate's\" share. ### right image (brand advocacy score section) **title**: \"brand advocacy score\" **data presentation**: - the same aggregate data but presented with colors associated to sentiment: - **overall**: 31 detractor (blue), 47 neutral (light blue), 22 advocate (dark blue). - *note*: - **detractor**: 31% (overall, sirona: 29% neutral, kavo: 26% neutral, 3m: 32% neutral, others: 36% neutral). - **neutral**: 47% (overall, sirona: 43% neutral, kavo: 48% neutral, 3m: 57% neutral, others: 47% neutral) **observation highlights**: - neutral sentiment dominates the overall sentiment, clearly outweighing the detractor group. - the detractor percentage is relatively consistent across all company categories. - the advocacy sentiment shows more variation, with sirona, kavo, 3m, and others offering noticeable differences. the combination of these two infographics provides a comparative visualization of how brand sentiment is positioned across different cad-cam companies. the image contains a simplified bar chart showing the brand advocacy score. it is a visual depiction designed to convey how likely respondents are to recommend certain companies to a colleague, using a scale where \"extremely unlikely\" is scored as 1 and \"extremely likely\" is scored as each brand's advocacy score is represented by a blue bar, with a percentage value beneath it indicating how strongly advocates are or detractors are for the brand, and a neutral bar depicting the percentage share classified as neutral. the bar chart is focused on summarizing data trends in the opinion landscape regarding brand preference. four companies are detailed in the chart: overall, sirona, kavo, and the 3m brand. each of these companies has a set of three bars that collectively represent the percentage ranges of detractors, neutrals, and advocates. *detailed description of each company's data in bar chart:** **overall:** - detractor: -8% - neutral: -1% - advocate: 77% **sirona:** - detractor: -1% - neutral: 28% - advocate: 71% **kavo:** - detractor: 0% - neutral: 26% - advocate: 74% **3m:** - detractor: 0% - neutral: 11% - advocate: 89% *contextual analysis in the first image:** the first image provides an intricate detailed tabular analysis with broader implications for companies' brand advocacy scores. each row represents a category with specific context, such as overall, sirona, kavo, and 3m, each accompanied by an appropriate bar chart. the first chart, associated with sirona, shows a breakdown in a range of 1 to 10 scores on a likert-type scale. as per the first image, sirona's brand advocacy score clusters around the neutral to slight advocacy side. kavo is indicated as more consistently advocates and thus likely receives stronger word-of-mouth referrals. in the context of the first image, more detailed processing reflects that sirona was evaluated on the assumption of providing clarity on recommendations, while 3m, being the highest, indicates an exceptionally strong positive advocacy effect among respondents. by combining both the first detailed tabular analysis and the second simplified bar chart form, the image encapsulates a comprehensive view that not only displays the raw percentage scale but also shows comparative context on company standings in terms of brand advocacy, making it easier for viewers to grasp the overall nuanced brand perception landscape succinctly.", "type": "Document"}}
