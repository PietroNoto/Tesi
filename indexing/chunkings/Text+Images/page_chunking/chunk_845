(282 cases) (201 cases) (282 cases) (201 cases) the penetration of users for both intraoral scanners and chairside milling units is quite stable, as a slight increase can be noted for the intra oral scanners only. the image shows an abbreviated chart displaying the statistical percentage of the penetration of users for two types of equipment: intraoral scanners and chairside milling units, as observed in 2015 and this is an overlay of the second chart into the first image which appears to be a page of a report or presentation. ### breakdown of the chart 1. **categories:** - **intraoral subcategories:** 1. **2015:** - **96%** users have intraoral scanners (signified by the light blue bar). - **4%** users have not (dark blue bar). 2. **2018:** - **94%** users have intraoral scanners. - **6%** users have not (light blue bar). - **chairside subcategories:** 1. **2015:** - **95%** users have chairside milling units (light blue bar). - **5%** users have not (dark blue bar). 2. **2018:** - **96%** users have chairside milling units. - **4%** users have not (light blue bar). 2. **text descriptions:** - *the penetration of users for both intraoral scanners and chairside milling units is quite stable, as a slight increase can be noted for the intraoral scanners only.* - *the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant.* 3. **note on measurement:** - each year is divided into two sections indicating the percentage of users who have both devices and those who do not. 4. **year comparison:** - for the years 2015 and 2018, the comparison of the percentages is shown with precise values. - the percentages for user penetration vary slightly between the years, indicating stability in usage trends while highlighting a slight increase for intraoral scanners. 5. **color coding:** - light blue bars represent the percentage of users who have the equipment. - dark blue bars represent the percentage of users who do not have the equipment. ### specific observations: **intraoral scanners:** - **2015 vs 2018:** there is an apparent slight decrease from 96% to 94% of users having intraoral scanners, indicating a minor shift. **chairside milling units:** - **2015 vs 2018:** both years show a nearly identical level of usage, with a slight increase from 95% to 96% of users having chairside milling units. ### conclusion: the image's presentation allows for a clear visual comparison of the adoption trends for intraoral scanners and chairside milling units over a two-year timeframe. this comparison is particularly useful for identifying and analyzing the small shifts in utilization within the user base of digital technologies used in the respective domains. the underlying visual information indicates a relatively stable but slightly declining adoption rate for intraoral scanners and growing acceptance among users for chairside milling units. the image contains two bar graphs that relate to the adoption of specific digital technologies by owners of digital technologies in 2015 and the graphs are located on page 24 of a document. both graphs represent the percentage of respondents who affirmed that they used different technologies in their practice. the first part of the image (on the left) details the use of an \"intra-oral scanner to take digital impressions.\" in 2015, 94% of respondents answered \"yes\" while 6% answered \"no,\" representing a total of 201 cases. by 2018, the percentage of respondents who used an intra-oral scanner increased slightly to 92%, while the percentage of those who did not reduce to 8%, totaling 282 cases. the second part of the image (on the right) focuses on the \"chairside milling unit.\" in 2015, the percentage of respondents who used this technology was 96%, and 4% did not, totaling 201 cases. in 2018, the percentage of users slightly increased to 95%, while the percentage of non-users also increased to 5%, with the total number of responses remaining the same at 282 cases. alongside these bar graphs, there is a note indicating that differences in percentages below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. this notation underscores the precision needed in interpreting the data presented. the data collectively imply a steady increase in the adoption of digital technologies over the three-year span, suggesting a trend towards greater integration of digital tools in dental practice environments.", "type": "Document"}}
