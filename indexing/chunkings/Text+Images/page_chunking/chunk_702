how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? overall brands 54 the charts show the weight of the items on the propensity to recommend a given brand, and on the right, their individual score. reliability, trust and reputation are the items showing the highest correlation with the recommendation. the items related to the pricing have low or no impact on the recommendation. analyzing the main brands, dentsply sirona model is very similar to the general one, with the exception of good price quality ratio, thus becoming a strategic item, being ranked as one of the top items, but with a lower than the average evaluation score. as for 3shape the item focused on the reputation received very high scores, and this item is also important in the definition of the recommendation, nevertheless, reliability and trustworthy seem not to perform on par with the mentioned item. the items makes daily practice easier and trustworthy looks to be somehow critical in carestream recommendation model, as they result to affect heavily the recommendation, but received rather weak evaluation scores. clinic the image contains a bar chart from a cliinic analyzing the correlation between key brand elements and average scores of overall brands. the chart specifically compares two types of factors: those associated with reliability and trustworthiness, and other aspects. the x-axis of the graph is labeled with various factors that have been evaluated, such as reliable, trustworthy, highly reputable, customer service oriented, innovative and at the forefront, makes daily practice easier, leading company, good price quality ratio, affordable, worldwide reknown (likely a typo meant to say \"worldwide reknown\" or similar intended to mean \"worldwide renowned\"), and too expensive. each of these factors is rated numerically as per its importance and the correlation with overall brand quality. the y-axis shows the average score for each factor in terms of overall brand quality. at the far right, there's a reference for the average scores: reliable has an average score of 0.642 trustworthy has an average score of 0.596 highly reputable has an average score of 0.551 customer service oriented has an average score of 0.499 innovative and at the forefront has an average score of 0.489 makes daily practice easier has an average score of 0.460 leading company has an average score of 0.419 good price quality ratio has an average score of 0.397 affordable has an average score of 0.343 worldwide reknown has an average score of 0.328 too expensive is not significant these scores appear to be significant for calculating the overall brand ranking, though some elements, like \"too expensive,\" are not significant enough to factor into the overall assessment. the specific significance of each item is claruded by a dashed vertical line against the score to indicate if it significantly contributes to the overall brand quality or not. the scores suggest a correlation between the perception of reliability and trustworthiness with the quality of overall brands, indicating the more these characteristics are strong, the more positive the correlation with overall brand performance. for example, reliability has the highest average score among the evaluated attributes, suggesting that trusted and dependable brands are highly valued. in contrast, factors like affordability and perceived value (affordable) are lower ranked, indicating challenges in achieving these qualities in brand value assessment. the image underlines the importance of attributes like reputation, customer service, and innovation in driving brand performance, whereas overly expensive attributes negatively impact overall brand value. the image contains a detailed breakdown of customer feedback scores for individual items, presented as a clustered bar chart. there are seven distinct items listed at the x-axis which assess the specific features such as \"reliable,\" \"trustworthy,\" \"highly reputable,\" \"customer service oriented,\" \"innovative and at the forefront,\" \"makes daily practice easier,\" \"leading company,\" \"good price quality ratio,\" \"affordable,\" \"worldwide known,\" and \"too expensive.\" each item has a corresponding bar graph indicating the average customer assessment score, shown on the right y-axis, which ranges from 2.9 to 4. each bar is color-coded in a solid red, and each category is represented by a descending order from left to right, with the highest average score at the top. the average scores for each item are as follows: \"reliable\" has an average score of 3.9. \"trustworthy\" has an average score of 4.2. \"highly reputable\" has an average score of 4.3. \"customer service oriented\" has an average score of 4.0. \"innovative and at the forefront\" has an average score of 4.1. \"makes daily practice easier\" has an average score of 3.7. \"leading company\" has an average score of 3.8. \"good price quality ratio\" has an average score of 2.9. \"affordable\" has an average score of 3.2. \"worldwide known\" has an average score of 2.9. \"too expensive\" has an average score of 3. under the bars, there's a dotted line graph indicating a descending trend from right to left, with the highest score placed towards the upper right of the chart and declining to the lower left. the primary focus of these items seems to be on service quality and reputation, whereas the other factors like affordability and widespread recognition have lower scores. this detailed representation can help in analyzing which attributes of a business or product stand out significantly to customers.", "type": "Document"}}
