on the left, the '2015' column lists reasons, such as 'too expensive' at 27%, while the '2018' column shows that 'too expensive' declines to 25%. - 'i don't need it,' 'low demand,' 'prefer traditional method,' 'poor system precision,' 'not interested,' and 'prefer technology' reasons are also present with varying percentages. - 'poor familiarity with the technology' increases 3 percentage points from 2015 to 2018. **overall trends**: - a noticeable drop in preferences over the years. - the 'low demand' and 'not interested' reasons decrease significantly, suggesting either an increase in awareness of available technologies among respondents or a less favorable reception. the second image essentially serves to quantitatively support the higher-level analysis and trends evident in the first image, painting a clearer picture of why non-ownership is prevalent in specific categories like cost, familiarity, and demand for these advanced technologies. the image contains a pie chart that presents the findings of a survey regarding the purchase intention of medical technology within two years. the chart is divided into two main segments, with the \"no\" segment being significantly larger than the \"yes\" segment. key elements of the pie chart: the \"yes\" segment, which indicates respondents who expressed interest in purchasing an intra-oral scanner, chairside cad-cam milling unit, or a 3d printing unit, occupies approximately 38% of the pie chart. the majority of the chart is occupied by the \"no\" segment, which comprises about 62%. additionally, the pie chart includes a smaller segment labeled \"if not, why?\" that displays the reasons why 62% of respondents do not intend to buy. the reasons are categorized as follows: - **too expensive**: 27% - **i prefer the traditional method**: 25% - **low demand**: 17% - **poor system precision**: 13% - **not interested**: 6% - **poor familiarity with the technology**: 3% the surrounding context from the first image provides additional insights into these trends: **bar graph: \"trend analysis\"**: presented below the pie chart, each bar represents a different year (2015 and 2018). the bars show the percentage of respondents who demonstrated a \"yes\" intent to buy, showing a slightly lower intent in 2018 compared to 2015. **text explanation**: an accompanying text highlights that interest in these digital technologies has decreased significantly, especially regarding a preference for traditional methods. the percentage of respondents concerned about the poor familiarity with the technology has also reduced. **stacked bar graph**: on the right side of the image, this graph highlights the proportion of each reason cited by respondents. the bars stack against each other, making it clear which reason is more prevalent with the largest bar representing those who consider the technology \"too expensive.\" thus, the pie chart and surrounding text collectively illustrate that while a smaller portion of respondents intend to purchase advanced dental technologies, the primary reasons behind this are financial constraints and a preference for traditional methods. the image contains two primary graphs related to survey responses regarding the purchase of advanced medical technologies over a given period. these responses are visualized in bar graphs, presenting comparative statistics between two years. ### detailed description of the image content *first graph:** **title:** the title of this main graph reads, \"technology intention to buy: overall,\" which suggests it provides an overview of general survey respondents' intentions to purchase. **source and date:** it is based on a sample of 245 cases collected in 2018. **trend analysis:** the visual representation is divided into two stacked horizontal bar graphs with labels from 2015 and 2018. - in 2015: - a more significant portion (73%) indicates that respondents did not intend to purchase. - a smaller portion (27%) indicates that they had an intention to purchase. in 2018, the proportions shifted: - a lower percentage (62%) indicated no intention to purchase. - a higher percentage (38%) indicated a desire to purchase. **overlap index explanation:** a note indicates that the differences are within +/- 2%, implying statistical insignificance, though the general trend remains clear. *second graph:** **question labels:** it appears to be a detailed breakdown of the reasons behind the buying or not buying intention. - **reasons for bought:** - too expensive: 27% (bar represents dark blue) - i prefer the traditional method: 12% (light blueish bar) - poor system precision: 13% (greenish bar) - not interested: 10% (light lavender bar) - poor familiarity with technology: 6% (more purple) - **reasons for not bought:** - i don't need it: 38% (dark blue) - low demand: 25% (blue) - i'm retiring: 9% (light lavender) - have other priorities: 6% - other: 7% (various other colors) ### observations: 1. **survey trends over time:** - a marked reduction in those who had no intention to purchase transitioned from 2015 to 2018, suggesting an increasing interest in adopting these technologies. - the percentage of respondents indicating intention increased from 27% to 38%, indicating a shift in interest over time. 2. **rationalization of not intention to buy:** - reasons like preference for traditional methods or poor system precision were not predominant, with most non-purchasers citing needs or other priorities like low demand or non-urgency. 3. **impact of overlap index:** - the overlap index clarifies the significance beyond raw percentages, ensuring the reader understands that despite statistical differences, many non-buyers had similar reasons. ### interpretation: the overall message of the image is to showcase the shift in survey respondents' interest in purchasing medical technologies between 2015 and this can be understood more contextually through the specific reasons provided in the detailed breakdown, highlighting the nuanced factors at play. these descriptions provide a thorough overview of both the visual content and underlying data trends without generalizing but offering specific insights.", "type": "Document"}}
