various aspects of a digital product or service from different media, namely \"total\" (538 mentions), \"open technologies\" (50 mentions), \"amann girrbach\" (30 mentions), and \"3shape\" (26 mentions). the vertical axis represents percentages ranging from 0% to 12%, with tick marks at intervals of 1%. the horizontal axis lists various categories, from \"facilidad la pr\u00e1ctica diaria\" ( daily practice ease ) to \"frecuencia de actualizaciones de los softwares\" ( frequency of software updates ). here is the detailed content of the bar graph: **facilidad la pr\u00e1ctica diaria**: the total category shows a 12% positive percentage, indicating a high level of satisfaction regarding the ease of daily practice. for amann girrbach, the same percentage is observed. for 3shape, it is also 12%. however, for open technologies, it\u2019s reduced to 1%, a massive drop in satisfaction. **fiabilidad**: both the total and amann girrbach categories have a 6% indication. 3shape also holds a consistent 6%, whereas open technologies continues the trend with the lowest rate at 3%. **precision y calidad global de las restaurantes**: for total and amann girrbach, there\u2019s a 5% satisfaction rate. 3shape remains at 1%. open technologies stands out with a 5% level. **aumento de productividad**: for all four groups, there is a 2% satisfaction rate with open technologies being the lowest at 1%. **compatibilidad con otras marcas**: the total and amann girrbach show a 2% satisfaction. 3shape has 1%. open technologies shows a slight increase at 5%. **manejabilidad / facilidad de uso**: for total, amann girrbach, and 3shape, it remains a 2% satisfaction rate. open technologies lags at 1%. **costo de las actualizaciones de los softwares**: both total and amann girrbach show a 12% positive rate regarding software cost concerns. open technologies stands out at 1%, a significant drop. 3shape reflects a high 9% at 1%. **amplia gama de materiales disponibles**: the total and amann girrbach mark has a 6% satisfaction, 3shape at 2%, and open technologies is at 5%. **amplia gama de procedimientos disponibles**: the same trend continues, with total, amann girrbach, and 3shape at 1%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. open technologies is at 3%. **costos generales de funcionamiento**: open technologies again appears with only 0% satisfaction, the most negative in this comparison. **satisfacci\u00f3n general**: all categories show a negative response from open technologies, ranging from -2% to -9%. **apopo al desarrollo empresarial**: the total and amann girrbach share a 2% positive sentiment. 3shape and open technologies have no notable rates. **formaci\u00f3n de puesta en marcha**: all categories show minimal involvement, with 0% to 1% positive. **soporte t\u00e9cnico de la empresa**: the total shows 2% positive, amann girrbach and 3shape both 1%, and open technologies at 2%. **disponibilidad y flexibilidad de la empresa**: the total shows 4% positive, amann girrbach and 3shape both at 2%, and open technologies at 5%. **asistencia t\u00e9cnica**: the total shows 5% positive, amann girrbach 4%, 3shape 2%, and open technologies 5%. **frecuencia de actualizaciones de los softwarees**: open technologies shows a stark drop to -9%, the most negative response compared to the other categories which range from -1% to 5% positive. overall, open technologies has the highest negative feedback in most categories, contrasting sharply with the other groups, reflecting a starkly low level of satisfaction across multiple dimensions. the image contains a vertical bar chart that visually represents several data points from a survey focusing on customer satisfaction with three different companies: open technologies, amann girbach, and 3shape. the chart title, \"puntuaci\u00f3n de satisfacci\u00f3n: foco en \u2018completamente satisfactoria\u2019,\" suggests that it specifically highlights the proportion of respondents who indicated they are \"completely satisfied.\" there are three bars within the chart, each corresponding to one of the three companies. the lengths of the bars are depicted in green with negative values highlighted in red to indicate dissatisfaction. the companies and their respective satisfaction values are as follows: \"open technologies\": the green bar for this company shows 29% satisfaction at the top of the bar, indicating a significant positive response. the red bar shows negative values of -9% at various points lower on the chart, indicating some dissatisfaction. \"amann girbach\": this company's green bar depicts 14% satisfaction, showing a lesser positive response compared to open technologies. the negative values are also less pronounced than those for open technologies, with red bars ranging from -1% to -9% indicating a decrease in satisfaction. \"3shape\": the green bar indicates 6% satisfaction, which is the smallest positive response among the three companies. the corresponding red bars vary from -2% to -9%, indicating moderate dissatisfaction but not as significant as for the first two companies. in addition, at the bottom of the chart, there is a key that differentiates the green bar percentage indicator (with the percentages 29%, 14%, and 6% respectively) and the red bar negative percentage values (with the percentages -9%, -2%, and -9% respectively) for easier comprehension. the image contains a vertical bar graph with two adjacent bar charts superimposed on a white background. the primary bar chart, located to the right of the image, has two sets of bars standing vertically. ### content of the primary bar graph: 1. **title**: the title of the primary bar graph reads \"diferencia con respecto a la media,\" which translates to \"difference with respect to the average\" in english. 2. **categories**: the categories or metrics are listed alongside the graph, as follows: - participaci\u00f3n diaria (daily participation) - fiabilidad (reliability) - precisi\u00f3n y calidad global de las reuniones (precision and global quality of meetings) - aumento de productividad (increase in productivity) - compatibilidad con otras marcas (compatibility with other brands) - manejabilidad / facilidad de uso (usability / ease of use) - costo de las actualizaciones de los software (cost of software updates) - amplia gama de materiales disponibles (broad range of available materials) - amplia gama de procedimientos disponibles (broad range of available processes) - costos generales de funcionalidad (general costs of functionality) - satisfacci\u00f3n general (general satisfaction) - apoyo al desarrollo empresarial (support for commercial development) - formaci\u00f3n de puesta en marcha (deployment training) - soporte t\u00e9cnico de la empresa (company technical support) - disponibilidad y flexibilidad de la empresa (company availability and flexibility) - addicionalidad en funcionalidades de software (additional features in software) - frecuencia de actualizaciones de los sofrware (frequency of software updates) 3. **metrics percentages**: the metrics are represented by percentages, and adjacent bars for the same metric are in two different shades: green and red. they indicate positive and negative differences from the average, respectively, with positive differences indicating above-average performance and negative differences indicating below-average performance. ### specific points of analysis: 1. **positive differences**: - **fiabilidad (reliability)**: the category has an above-average performance, indicated by a green bar with a percentage close to +16%. - **precisi\u00f3n y calidad global de las reuniones (precision and global quality of meetings)**: another positive aspect, shown with a green bar approaching the +16% mark. - **satisfacci\u00f3n general (general satisfaction)**: positive, with a green bar reading roughly between +0% and +4%. - **disponibilidad y flexibilidad de la empresa (company availability and flexibility)**: positive difference, with a green bar just below 0%. 2. **negative differences**: - **aumento de productividad (increase in productivity)**: shows a significant negative metric with a red bar almost reaching -14%. - **costo de las actualizaciones de los software (cost of software updates)**: negative, close to -11%. - **amplia gama de procedimientos disponibles (broad range of available processes)**: negative with a red bar almost reaching -19%. 3. **mixed metrics**: - **costos generales de funcionalidad (general costs of functionality)** has a very close-to-zero percentage with minor fluctuation. the image gives a clear visual representation of the difference of specific metrics from an average baseline, allowing for quick interpretation of areas where the measured entities perform significantly better or worse than the norm. the image contains a detailed list of evaluation categories for assessing customer satisfaction with a software system. each
