(15% vs 7% overall). the image shows a comparative bar and pie chart illustrating the perceived influence of digital technologies on the prosthetics industry across five countries: germany (de), france (fr), uk, italy, and spain (sp). the data indicates various respondents' beliefs regarding the future of prosthetics technology and its potential overlap with traditional prosthetics. the pie and bar charts display the following insights: 1. **germany (de)** - a large blue pie slice indicates 70% believe that digital technologies will have a limited effect on traditional prosthetics. - a blue bar shows 91% indicate that traditional prosthetics will remain relevant in the future. - a blue section within a pie slice states 23% feel that digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics. - a small portion is marked with 7% who are uncertain (unknown). 2. **france (fr)** - a blue pie slice is 49%. - blue bar represents 45% believing that traditional prosthetics will continue to be relevant. - small blue section is denoted as 46%, with 6% uncertain. 3. **uk** - pie slice shaded in blue is marked with 50%. - the bar signifies that 45% believe traditional prosthetics will remain relevant. - a small segment marked in blue is 6% with 5% unknown. 4. **italy (it)** - showing a blue slice with the value 45%. - bar shows 48% feeling that traditional prosthetics will continue to have importance. - small piece marked as 5%, with 6% unknown. 5. **spain (sp)** - pie slice displays 50%. - corresponding bar depicts 45%. - only 5% were uncertain with 10% believing digital technologies will replace traditional prosthetic. the color coding and layout in the chart are as follows: red color: represents 15% believing digital technologies will replace most traditional prosthetics. bright blue color: indicating a large majority (around 45%-70%) feel traditional prosthetics will maintain their relevance despite technological advancements. light blue color: smaller segments (7%-23%) are those who believe digital technologies will have a significant impact on traditional prosthetics to a significant extent. dark grey: reflects the unknown or undecisive stance (typically 1%-6%). overall, the image offers a clear visual comparison of the attitudes of the respondents across these countries regarding the prospective role of digital technologies in prosthetics, indicating varied yet insightful perspectives.", "type": "Document"}}
