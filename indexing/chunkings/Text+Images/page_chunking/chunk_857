no**: - light blue bar: 38% - darker blue bar: 24% 2. **digit. restor. provider - yes**: - light blue bar: 39% - darker blue bar: 26% 3. **digit. restor. provider - in-lab milling**: - light blue bar: 30% - darker blue bar: 28% 4. **digit. restor. provider - scanner**: - light blue bar: 38% - darker blue bar: 26% 5. **digit. restor. provider - full outsourcing**: - light blue bar: 44% - darker blue bar: 24% 6. **digit. restor. provider - manufacturer**: - light blue bar: 39% - darker blue bar: 24% 7. **digit. restor. provider - partner lab**: - light blue bar: 38% - darker blue bar: 29% these bar graphs visually emphasize the respondents' expectations, with the light blue representing the proportion who think the relationship with the industry or cad processing will improve and easier, and the darker blue illustrating those who expect the relationship to become tighter due to the specializations required. in summary, the chart and graphs present a comparative analysis of responses among different stakeholders in the dental industry concerning the impact of digital technologies on the relationship dynamics between various parties involved in dental manufacturing and restoration practices. the image contains a textual analysis of survey responses concerning changes in the relationship between dentists, technicians, and the industry due to new digital technologies. these responses were categorized into four points, each accompanied by color-coded answers. the points listed are: 1. **the relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing** - responding in agreement (blue) 35% - indifferent/n/a (gray) 1% - disagreeing (red) 1% - don't know (white) 2% 2. **the relationship will become blander because the cad processing will be even easier and it does not require specific expertise from the dentists** - responding in agreement (blue) 44% - indifferent/n/a (gray) 2% - disagreeing (red) 2% - don't know (white) 1% 3. **the relationship with the industry will become tighter because of the need for case-specific manufactured products and services** - responding in agreement (blue) 38% - indifferent/n/a (gray) 3% - disagreeing (red) 3% - don't know (white) 4% 4. **dont know** - responding in agreement (blue) 25% - indifferent/n/a (gray) 11% - disagreeing (red) 11% - don't know (white) 52% each category, along with its corresponding percentage, highlights different perspectives of the survey respondents regarding the impact of digital technology on the relationship dynamics between dentists, technicians, and industry providers. the color scheme differentiates the proportion of agreement and disagreement, with blue, red, and white bars representing varying degrees of affirmation or doubt from different categories and professions within the industry.", "type": "Document"}}
