(202 cases) (152 cases) the image contains a bar chart illustrating the percentage of indications for 3d printing in various dental fields, broken down by two separate years. the chart specifically highlights data from 2018 and 2015, and uses a color-coded system to differentiate between the two periods. the categories listed include \"temporary crowns and bridges,\" \"definite crowns and bridges,\" \"orthodontics,\" \"models,\" \"splints,\" \"surgical guides for implant dentistry,\" \"mobile dentures,\" \"fixed substruc- tures,\" and \"impression trays.\" the bars for 2018 and 2015 show varying percentages, providing insights into the changes and similarities in the use of 3d printing across these categories. here are some detailed observations: 1. **temporary crowns and bridges**: the chart indicates that temporary crowns and bridges had a 65% indication for 3d printing in 2018 and 57% in this suggests a 8 percentage point increase, indicating growing acceptance or utilization in this area. 2. **definite crowns and bridges**: the most significant increase is seen in definite crowns and bridges, with 68% in 2018 and 65% in this represents a 3 percentage point rise, reflecting potential improvements and trust in the technology. 3. **orthodontics**: the percentage for orthodontic applications in 3d printing decreased from 59% in 2015 to 55% in 2018, a 4 percentage point decrease, which might indicate a shift or competition with other technologies. 4. **models**: this category had 55% in 2018 and 0% in 2015, suggesting that models had no indication in 2015 but became a significant area in 2018. 5. **splints**: both 2018 and 2015 had a 0% indication for splints, highlighting this area as perhaps either not applicable or overlooked in 3d printing applications. 6. **surgical guides for implant dentistry**: this category saw a significant spike to 74% in 2018 from the absence of it being indicated in 2015. 7. **mobile dentures**: the percentage decreased from 49% in 2015 to 36% in 2018. 8. **fixed substruc- tures**: this category saw a slight increase from 45% in 2015 to 61% in 2018. 9. **impression trays**: the percentage decreased from 32% in 2015 to 41% in overall, the chart provides a clearer look at which areas of dental practice saw an increase or decrease in the indication for 3d printing, potentially guiding further research or technological investments.", "type": "Document"}}
