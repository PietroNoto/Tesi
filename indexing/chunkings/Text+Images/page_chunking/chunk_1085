large section (no 3d printer):** - predominantly occupied by the brown segment, signifying the majority of dentists who did not purchase any 3d printer. **11% - small section (yes 3d printer):** - represented by a much smaller blue segment, indicating a smaller fraction of dentists who did purchase a 3d printer. #### legend on the image: **blue segment (yes):** indicates the dentists who have opted to purchase a 3d printer. **brown segment (no):** indicates the dentists who have not purchased a 3d printer. #### numerical and contextual information: **89% no:** indicates a high reluctance or lack of need for 3d printers among the surveyed dentists. **11% yes:** highlights a minority of dentists who have recognized the value or necessity of a 3d printer and made a purchase. #### additional data provided (not in pie chart): two other types of bar graphs are positioned above the pie chart: - **first bar graph (year of purchase - average: 2020):** - **dentsply sironta:** listed with 25% - **anycubic:** 19% - **formlabs:** 14% - **sprintray:** 11% - **elegoo:** 6% - **creality:** 6% - **phrozen:** 4% - **asiga:** 3% - **zorotz:** 2% - **3d medisys:** 1% - **other:** 0.1% - the bar graph shows the distribution of different brand choices for those dentists who purchased a 3d printer in 2020, with dentsply sironta being the most popular choice. - **second bar graph (main indications for 3d printer use):** - **surgical guides:** 51% - **temporary c&b:** 43% - **impression trays:** 38% - **alignment guides:** 31% - **permanent c&b:** 27% the bar graph explains the prevalent uses of the 3d printers among the dentists who did purchase one. it highlights that surgical guides constituted the most significant use. #### combined analysis: the combined visual and numerical data convey that although a small minority of dentists have purchased 3d printers, dentsply siron had the most popularity and the printers are predominantly used for surgical guidance. in summary, the pie chart succinctly indicates the preferences of dentists regarding 3d printer purchase, with surgical applications being a significant motivation for those who have made the investment. the image contains a bar graph illustrating the main indications and procedures used for 3d printers, as indicated by the data from various dental practice responses. the background of the image appears to be a larger visual layout from a professional report or presentation. the graph in question specifically breaks down the use of 3d printers in dentistry across several categories, with each category represented by a horizontal bar, each bar's length proportional to the percentage of use for that particular indication. the percentages and categories represented in the bar graph include: 1. **surgical guides** - 51% 2. **temporary c&b (coronations and buildups)** - 43% 3. **impression trays** - 41% 4. **aligners** - 38% 5. **permanent c&b** - 31% the graph is part of a report detailing the use of 3d printers in dentistry practices, providing insights into which types of dental work are supported most widely by these machines. the precise and clear division of data enables dental practitioners to better understand how 3d printers are implementing in their field and identify their specific strengths and potential areas for further optimization. the bar graph format makes it straightforward to compare the usage percentages of various applications, giving a clear visual representation over potential trends and areas of focus for dentistry technology integration.", "type": "Document"}}
