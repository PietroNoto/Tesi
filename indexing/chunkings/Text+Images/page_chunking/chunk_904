not satisfied: 13% - rather satisfied: 57% - very satisfied: 30% 2. **accuracy and overall quality of the restorations** - not satisfied: 15% - rather satisfied: 34% - very satisfied: 51% 3. **compatibility with other brands** - not satisfied: 49% - rather satisfied: 19% - very satisfied: 32% 4. **wide range of materials available** - not satisfied: 17% - rather satisfied: 43% - very satisfied: 40% 5. **technical support from the company** -

each row in the table corresponds to a satisfied percentage, an overall satisfaction percentage, and a total rating. - the top-middle column lists different survey results (such as \"accuracy and overall quality of the restorations\" and \"technical assistant in case of repair\") divided into three categories: 1. **top row:** indicates the survey category or attribute. 2. **middle row:** represents the satisfied percentages with light blue bars. 3. **bottom row:** indicates the overall satisfaction ratings with dark blue bars. - the third column, right, shows numerical values (presumably rating scores or averages) at the end of each row. **survey categories:** the table shows various criteria evaluated by the survey respondents: - **handiness / ease of use** - **accuracy and overall quality of the restorations** - **compatibility with other brands** - **wide range of materials available** - **technical support from the company** - **technical assistance in case of repair** - and more, including reliability, start-up training, business development support, \"overall running costs,\" \"frequency of sw updates from the company,\" \"cost of sw updates,\" and company availability and flexibility. **overall satisfaction calculation:** the bottom row in light blue color indicates the average satisfaction rating for each survey category, using a value-based system from 1 to 100 (representing not very satisfied to very satisfied). for example, an entry for accuracy and overall quality of the restorations shows: - satisfied: 34% - overall satisfaction: 24% - overall grade: 42% **data representation:** different shades of blue indicate varying levels of customer satisfaction: - lighter blue for satisfied/positive responses (~18-35%). - heavier blue for less satisfied/negative responses (~26-62%). - the darker blue at the bottom indicates the overall satisfaction rating for each company. overall, the table presents a clear visualization of customer satisfaction within the cad-cam industry specific to software categories, providing an insightful overview of how each company stands against these survey metrics.", "type": "Document"}}
