in-house percentage of laboratories base: 108 cases (milling units owners) percentage of elements in-house production share 2018 % in-house 21,2 100% materials in blocks 1,6 7% materials in discs 19,7 93% total (milling units owners) 108 labo materials in blocks materials in discs only 36% of laboratories equipped with internal milling units use materials in blocks, while 94% use discs. the production deriving from discs, in terms of number of elements, represents over 90% of the total production in the laboratory. 128 the image shows a pie chart with two distinct sections, a blue segment and a white segment. the blue segment is labeled \"yes\" with a sizeable proportion of the pie chart, accounting for 94% of the total area. the white segment is labeled \"no,\" representing the smaller segment, making up the remaining 6% of the total area. the blue segment, which occupies the majority of the pie chart, visually suggests that a high majority of respondents, as indicated by the numeric label \"94,\" agree or affirmatively respond to whatever question or statement the pie chart is addressing. the small white section, indicated by \"no,\" suggests a minimal percentage, possibly only 6%, who disagree or have a negative response to the same question or statement. the pie chart is displayed within the context of a page that includes accompanying texts, tables, and additional visual markers, but the focus remains solely on the pie chart itself with clear, bold numerical labels in the respective segments. overall, the image visually breaks down a response distribution into two clear percentages, emphasizing an overwhelming majority's agreement and a negligible percentage's disagreement or negative response. the second image is a pie chart with a title and some annotations. the title at the top of the image reads materials for in-house production, considering all the elements produced with your milling unit, what percentage is produced with blocks and what percentage with discs? in-house. below the title, there is a pie chart divided into two segments, a large blue segment and a smaller white segment. **large blue segment**: - this occupies the majority of the pie chart and is labeled \"yes 36%\". this signifies that 36% of laboratories equipped with internal milling units use materials in blocks for their in-house production. **small white segment**: - this smaller segment is located in the lower right quadrant and is labeled \"no 64%\". it indicates that 64% of the laboratories in this context do not use materials in blocks for in-house production. to further break down the information: the pie chart visually represents the distribution of laboratories based on whether they produce materials in blocks. the color coding of the segments helps differentiate between the two statistics: blue for 'yes' (36%) and white for 'no' (64%). annotations and additional details around the pie chart from the first image explain that only 36% of laboratories use materials in blocks, whereas 94% use discs. the text emphasizes that elements produced from discs represent over 90% of the total production in the laboratory. in terms of the percentage of elements, the same pie chart has segments representing \"materials in blocks\" as 7% and \"materials in discs\" as 93%. the detailed analysis provided by the second image in the context of the first one visually demonstrates the usage of materials in discs versus blocks in laboratory production, aligning them with the broader data. in summary, this image clearly delineates the preference of laboratories for using materials in discs over blocks for their in-house production needs. the image contains a pie chart divided into two sections. the larger section represents 93% of the data, colored in green, while a smaller, triangular section represents 7% of the data, colored in grey. the pie chart is labeled at the top, where the percentage of 93% is clearly marked in white text. there is an arrow pointing to this portion from a connecting text box labeled \"percentage of elements,\" indicating that this section corresponds to the elements in discs. the chart is titled \"percentage of materials in discs,\" further clarifying the content. this pie chart is part of a larger infographic found on a page discussing the in-house production of materials and the reliance on discs versus blocks in material milling units. the inclusion of these pie charts helps to visually represent the respective percentages of materials produced using the two methods, contributing to the overall data and analysis framework presented by the infographic.", "type": "Document"}}
