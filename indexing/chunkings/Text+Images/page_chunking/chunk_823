70% (dark blue): \"they will not play an important role because digital technologies will affect a limited part of the prosthetics.\" - 23% (light blue): \"they will play an important role but i feel the traditional prosthetics will continue to be relevant in the future.\" - 7% (lightest blue): \"digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics.\" - 2% (dark blue): \"dont know.\" the accompanying bar chart, labeled \"country,\" presents data for five european countries: germany (de): 2% \"dont know,\" 7% traditional (dark blue), 91% limited role due to digital technologies (light blue). france (fr): 4% \"dont know,\" 5% traditional (dark blue), 46% limited role (light blue). italy (it): 4% \"dont know,\" 6% traditional (dark blue), 48% limited role (light blue). spain (sp): 5% \"dont know,\" 4% traditional (dark blue), 50% limited role (light blue). united kingdom (uk): 15% \"dont know,\" 58% limited role (light blue), 26% traditional (dark blue). the bar charts visually represent the proportions and percentages of survey responses. the dark blue represents the traditional prosthetics, the light blue represents an expectation of limited role for digital technologies, and the lightest blue signifies those who believe that digital technologies will completely replace most traditional prosthetics. the purple segments indicate respondents who don't know the role of digital technologies. the image conveys that despite a slight inclination to regard digital technologies positively, most respondents across these countries foresee their secondary role in prosthetics, with the traditional approach expected to dominate the future landscape significantly. the image contains a summary of survey data regarding perceptions of the role that digital technologies will play in the field of prosthetics. the data is shown in the form of a bar chart that is extracted from a larger infographic. the bar chart breaks down the responses to the question, \"how do you feel digital technologies (cad-cam and 3d printing) will affect the way the prosthetics is carried out in your country?\" the axis on the x-axis represents the different countries included in the survey: germany, uk, france, turkey, and the usa. each country has distinct percentages for its specific responses, represented by colored bars. germany shows a high percentage of respondents (91%) who feel digital technologies will play an important role but believe traditional prosthetics will continue to be relevant in the future. a small 7% feels digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics, and 7% is uncertain (marked as \"don't know\"). in the uk, the majority (55%) believes digital technologies will have significant impact but still prefer traditional methods. a substantial 26% think they will replace most of the traditional prosthetics, and 15% are uncertain. for france, 48% expects digital technologies to play an important role but still considers traditional methods relevant (45%), and 6% believe they will replace most traditional prosthetics. across turkey, 50% acknowledges that digital technologies will have an important role while continuing to value traditional methods (50%), and 6% think digital technology will replace traditional methods. the usa shows 45% expecting a significant but limited impact of digital technologies on prosthetics, while 45% feels traditional methods still play a pivotal role, 5% believes they will replace most traditional methods, and 5% is uncertain. overall, the survey reveals varying levels of confidence and expectations across different countries regarding how digital technologies such as cad-cam and 3d printing will influence the field of prosthetics. the notable conclusion drawn from the summary is that despite the advancements in digital technology, traditional methods are still seen as vital in the field of prosthetics.", "type": "Document"}}
