46% practice less than 30 appointments per week. - 41% practice 30 or more appointments per week. - 13% don't know or answer is not available for this metric. *middle pie chart analysis:** this chart is titled \"number of precision impressions a week.\" it categorizes practice activity based on the quantity of precision impressions a week, revealing three distinct segments: **key data points:** - 50% practice less than 5 precision impressions per week. - 43% practice 5 or more precision impressions per week. - 7% don't know or answer is not available for this metric. *right pie chart analysis:** this chart is titled \"number of implants placed in the last year.\" it shows the distribution of practice activity concerning implants based on the number placed within the last year, further broken down by three categories: **key data points:** - 32% practice up to 20 implants. - 24% practice from 21 to 50 implants. - 20% practice more than 50 implants. - 24% don't know or answer is not available for this metric. the data is sourced from a random sample of 455 cases, with a total of 9 metrics analyzed visually. the overall color scheme is designed with shades of blue for numerical data categories and grey for the 'don't know, no answer' category. color codes are used appropriately to maintain clarity and distinguish between categories across all pie charts. the first image denotes these charts, while the second image simply replicates the second chart from the first image showing a 46% large blue portion under \"less than 30.\" the image contains a pie chart that visually represents data related to the \"stratification of the practice activity.\" specifically, this pie chart is segmented into three categories with corresponding percentages. 1. **main category \"less than 5\"** is the largest segment, taking up 50% of the pie chart. it is colored in blue. 2. **second category \"5 or more\"** is slightly smaller, occupying 43% of the pie chart. this segment is represented in a darker blue. 3. **third category \"dont know, no answer\"** is the smallest segment, making up 7% of the pie chart. this segment is shown in gray. the legend in the lower part of the pie chart also includes the colors associated with each category: \"less than 5\": blue \"5 or more\": darker blue \"dont know, no answer\": gray in the context of the first image, which likely contains more statistical data from the practice activity survey (\"stratification of the practice activity\"), the pie chart specifically focuses on frequency distribution of the response \"less than 5.\" this suggests that the majority of respondents (50%) have had less than 5 appointments in a specific period, with a significant portion (43%) having had 5 or more. the remaining 7% are undecided or didn't know. the presentation of these pie charts in the provided image aims at providing a clear and immediate understanding of the frequency distribution of certain responses, in this case, specifically outlining the number of weekly appointments, precision impressions, and implants placed.", "type": "Document"}}
