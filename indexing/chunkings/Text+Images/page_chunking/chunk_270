difference from mean\". it shows a comparison of perceptions of two groups of customers, referred to as \"ultradent\" and \"voco\", based on the difference in their mean brand perception scores. the data reflects how they rate different brand attributes in comparison to the average (mean) perceptions. below is a detailed description of the chart: 1. **legend and labeling**: two categories of customers are represented: \"all brands (1,142 quotes)\", which includes combined data from both groups, and \"ultradent (36 quotes)\" and \"voco (58 quotes)\", which are presumably the specific consumer groups surveyed. 2. **brand attributes ratings**: the chart bars represent each individual attribute rated by the customers for relevance compared to the mean. there are ten attributes: - this company has a high reputation - this company has products with the highest quality - this company has a long-time tradition - the products of this company are the easiest to use - i trust this company more than others - i think that it is the right company for innovation - i feel this company to be among the most customer-oriented ones - i feel this company to be among the most familiar and friendly one - this company supports my business development more than others - the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio 3. **percentages difference**: - attributes like this company has a high reputation\" and \"this company has products with the highest quality are rated significantly higher by both ultradent and voco customers than the mean, especially for ultradent with 28% and 13% respectively. - conversely, there are attributes where customers, particularly ultradent, give notably lower scores: - \"this company is easy to use\" with -21% - \"this company supports my business development more than others\" with -20% - \"the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio\" with -15% 4. **graph orientation**: - the x-axis shows the attributes while the y-axis represents the percentage difference in customer perceptions relative to the mean. - bars are shaded green to indicate positive deviations from the mean and red to indicate negative deviations. - ultradent has more bars in red compared to voco, indicating a strong difference from the mean. 5. **visual style and source**: - the overall design is simplistic with a clear and readable color scheme. - the bottom of the image includes a watermark of brandequity, the source of the data, along with the page number indicating it is a part of a larger document or report. this bar chart is useful for understanding how customers within different segments view company attributes, highlighting where positive feedback is concentrated and where there is dissatisfaction. the stark contrast in perception across different attributes allows for focused improvements tailored to the preferences and expectations of each customer group. the highlighted positive attributes can encourage continued investment in areas where these groups value high reputation and quality, while the negative attributes will need targeted attention to address customer concerns and improve overall satisfaction scores. the image shows a survey response with the heading \"brand image: focus on 'totally relevant' difference from mean in your opinion, how do you rate the mentioned brands in the following areas?\" it provides a list of seven statements representing various aspects of a brand image, along with associated responses that indicate the perceived importance and relevance of these statements among customers. here are the specific elements of the image: 1. **header information:** -
