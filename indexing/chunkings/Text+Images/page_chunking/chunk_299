brands: 90 first and foremost, it is important to highlight that the measured penetration refers to the overall activity of the practice, and is not limited to specific categories such as impression materials or restorative products. this explains the relatively higher data compared to what is typically measured for a specific product category. furthermore, it is interesting to note that companies with a wide portfolio covering multiple product categories have higher penetration and lower abandonment rates compared to the average (0,36). yes, i currently use its products / no, i used its products, but not anymore base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) the image contains a horizontal bar chart titled 'switch analysis: historical penetration and abandonment rate', providing a detailed visual representation of the brand penetration and abandonment metrics. the chart is divided into three main sections: abandonment rate, current penetration, and historical penetration. below is a detailed breakdown based on the content of the image: *historical penetration:** 1. **3m** has a high penetration rate of 69%. 2. **dentsply sirona** has an 83% penetration rate. 3. **kerr** is at 78% penetration. 4. **ivoclar** shows a 80% penetration rate. 5. **gc** stands at 74% penetration. 6. **ultradent** has a 66% penetration rate. 7. **voco** stands at 67% penetration. 8. **zhermack** is at 38%, significantly lower compared to others. 9. **kulzer** has a 31% penetration. 10. **kuraray** is not specified but is listed with lower figures. 11. **tokuyama** shows 21% penetration. *current penetration:** the current penetration rate for 3m is 89%. dentsply sirona reports a high current penetration of 83%. kerr stands at 61%. ivoclar shows 59% current penetration. gc is 80%. ultradent is 42%. voco stands at 40%. zhermack is at 36%. kulzer shows a current penetration of 58%. kuraray and tokuyama's figures are not detailed but represent lower current penetration statistics. *abandonment rate:** the abandonment rate for dentsply sirona is 0, kerr's abandonment rate is slightly lower at 0, ivoclar's abandonment rate is around 0, gc has a rate of 0, ultradent is at 0, voco's abandonment rate is 0, zhermack's score is slightly lower at 0, gulzer's numbers stand at 0, kuraray and tokuyama follow with 0,50 and 0,47 abandonment rates, respectively. the overall message of the image is to assess the current and historical penetration rates of different dental materials brands, providing a clear visual comparison of how each brand has fared historically and in the current market. the abandonment rate graphically underlines the transition rate of consumers and practices within this sector. the chart makes use of varying shades of blue to differentiate between historical and current data. each section includes a numerical score at the right side, adding another level of quantitative information for analysis purposes. the inclusion of both abandonment and penetration rates allows for a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics in the dental industry, highlighting how brands are maintaining their market share and attracting new adopters. the image contains a line graph situated within the context of a detailed analysis on product penetration and abandonment rates as indicated by the surrounding text in the first image. the graph depicts data points representing both the absorption rate and the current penetration of the products from different brands. the specific content of the graph includes a series of discrete data points along a horizontal axis that represents the percentage ranges of product utilization or penetration, indicated by the red line. at the top of the horizontal axis, values range from 0 to approximately 0.47, suggesting that the penetration rates presented are fractions between 0 and 0. each data point is connected by straight segments forming a line, showing how the average absorption rate of different products changes over time or some other measured dimension. these points indicate the trend of product usage, where higher points signify higher penetration, and lower points signify lower penetration. the data representation in the graph implies a step-by-step increase in penetration to near a plateau, with a slight increase at the end. key data points include: starting with lower absorption rates around 0.22 towards 0.28. a transition period between 0.28 and 0.36, signifying a moderate increase. an uptick between 0.36 and 0.48, showing a significant rise. a plateau period, indicating continued high absorption close to 0.50. lastly, a slight increase to 0.47, showing a slight drop or variability in the later stages. the overall trend suggests consistent improvement in absorption of the products, followed by stabilization, likely reflecting market saturation or increased consumer engagement. the graph's red line provides a clear visual cue for the changes in product utilization, facilitating easy interpretation of the data. this specific graphical tool is designed to highlight the changes and trends in the measured variable over the sample period represented.", "type": "Document"}}
