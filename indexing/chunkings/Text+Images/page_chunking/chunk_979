(scores from 1 definitely will not be using to 10 definitely will be using) the possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores among the brands evaluated. the clustering is the following: high risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 1 to medium risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 4 to low risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to the defection risk derives from the assumption that a low value of repurchase intention may mean a risk that in the future the product will not be used anymore. lower scores in the repurchase intention bear a higher defection risk, while higher scores mean that a current customer will probably still be using that product also in the future. mean 86 base: 538 quotes base: 50 quotes base: 30 quotes base: 26 quotes still comparing the spanish results to the italian ones, it is worth to note the higher perception of risk in spain, where all investigated brands show a certain percentage of very low scores below the image shows a bar graph displaying repurchase intention scores over a period of five years from the main categories of companies. the categories presented are overall, open technologies, amann girbach, and 3shape. the x-axis of the bar graph indicates the percentage of respondents in three distinct risk groups: high risk (1 to 3), medium risk (4 to 6), and low risk (7 to 10). for each category, there are three bars differentiated by color: the orange bar represents respondents in the high risk group (22% for overall, 4% for open technologies, 13% for amann girbach, and 15% for 3shape). the yellow (labeled medium risk) bar represents respondents in the medium risk group (23% for overall, 40% for open technologies, 27% for amann girbach, and 23% for 3shape). the blue bar represents respondents in the low risk group (55% for overall, 56% for open technologies, 60% for amann girbach, and 62% for 3shape). this graphical representation reveals varying degrees of repurchase intention based on the perceived risk. for instance, a large percentage (55% to 62%) of the respondents seem to indicate a low risk of not repurchasing products. on the contrary, smaller groups (4% for open technologies, 13% for amann girbach, and 15% for 3shape) fall into the high risk group, implying a likely cessation of repurchasing within five years. notable comparisons also reveal that a higher proportion (40%) of respondents from open technologies group falls in the medium risk category, compared to the amann girbach group (27%) and the overall group (23%). the image shows a line graph, titled \"repurchase intention score: main brands,\" illustrating the average repurchase intention scores for four different brands. it is the focal point of the page that presents a survey result regarding the future usage of cad-cam equipment by respondents from different spanish brands. the top section lists brands with different numbers of quotes and shows the mean repurchase intention score from 1 to 10, where 1 signifies high risk (low likelihood of repurchasing) and 10 signifies low risk (high likelihood of repurchasing). in the line graph, the scores for the four brands are represented through colored circles: an orange circle marked with '6.4' a yellow circle marked with '7.4' a blue circle marked with '6.9' a green circle marked with '6.2' these values lie along a diagonal line that represents a progression of mean repurchase intention scores. the graph conveys that the brand represented by the yellow circle (with a score of 7.4) is the most popular among respondents, suggesting the highest likelihood of repurchasing, followed by the blue circle at 6.9, then the orange circle at 6.4, and lastly, the green circle at 6. the analysis presented in the graph is intended to assess consumer trust and likelihood to continue using the same brands' cad-cam equipment based on their experiences and the current state of these brands in the market. this provides valuable insights into market trends and helps companies understand their standing and future potential in consumers' eyes.", "type": "Document"}}
