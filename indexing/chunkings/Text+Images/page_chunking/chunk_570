**makes the daily practice easier (19%)**: the bar representing this reason has a moderate length, showing that just below half of the respondents valued this aspect. - **quality of the restorations (28%)**: this is the most significant reason according to the chart, as it represents more than a quarter of the total responses. - **broad and range procedures (16%)**: the bar indicates this aspect as the third most emphasized reason among the 230 cases. - **innovation (15%)**: with a relatively similar bar length to \"broad range of procedures,\" this reason is tied for the fourth place. - **other reasons (2%)**: this is the least significant factor in this list, with a very short bar. - **reputation of the brand (5%)**: this shows a slight preference, though it does not stand out among the major reasons. - **convenience (5%)**: once more, it is quite minimal and similar to \"reputation of the brand.\" - **flexibility (4%)**: this is slightly better than \"convenience\" and \"reputation of the brand\" but still minor. - **productivity increase (3%)**: it is the second most minuscule reason. 2. **in-lab milling**: - **makes the daily practice easier (39%)**: this represents a significant increase in value compared to the scanner category, indicating that in-lab milling is particularly valued for simplifying daily practice. - **quality of the restorations (25%)**: this is the second most valued among the respondents, highlighting the importance of restoration quality in in-lab milling. - **broad range of procedures (19%)**: slightly lower than the scanner category, this reason still holds considerable weight. - **flexibility (4%)**: similar to \"innovation\" in the scanner section, but slightly higher in the in-lab milling context. - **convenience (9%)**: a notable increase over the scanner, again suggesting in-lab milling's superiority here. - **innovation (4%)**: remains consistent with scanner, indicating modest importance. - **reputation of the brand (4%)**: the same as \"innovation\" and \"flexibility.\" - **productivity increase (3%)**: again, similar to \"productivity increase\" in the scanner comparison. - the **other** category is 3%. a notable observation is that the perception of using a scanner/in-lab milling unit varies significantly between the two contexts. for scanners, ease of daily practice is the most common reason, whereas for in-lab milling, ease and functionality dominate. on the right-hand side of the chart, there is a summary sentence \"daily practice made easier and quality of the restorations are the main reasons quoted by the digital equipment users. to a lesser extent, flexibility in terms of a broader range of procedures available and the convenience are also felt to be important.\" this aligns the visual data by emphasizing the pivotal role of ease of use and quality.", "type": "Document"}}
