this response indicates a belief that despite technological advancements, the fundamental roles of individuals in the field will remain unchanged due to inherent differences in expertise and responsibilities. 2. **the cooperation between dentists and technicians will increase because the knowledge of the technician in prosthetics materials, esthetics and digital processing are important** - this option suggests that the integration between dentists and technicians will grow, primarily driven by an appreciation and necessity for the specialized knowledge that technicians possess, especially in the areas of prosthetics materials, esthetics, and digital processing. 3. **the dentists will need to get more expertise about prosthetics**, because they will be required to perform part of the work in charge of technicians this answer implies a shift towards dentists needing to possess more expertise in prosthetics themselves, possibly reflecting a trend toward dentists taking over more duties traditionally handled by technicians. 4. **dont know** - this response signifies uncertainty or a lack of clear understanding about how roles might change or evolve with new digital technologies in the dental profession. these responses collectively represent a spectrum of viewpoints ranging from resistant to change (believing that individual roles will remain distinct) to an anticipation of increased collaboration and broader skill sets. this context, when aligned with the accompanying pie chart and additional data from the first image, offers a comprehensive view into the diverse perceptions and expectations regarding the impact of new digital technologies on the roles of dentists and technicians.", "type": "Document"}}
