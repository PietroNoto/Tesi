for example, 3m perception is more featured by the established reputation, while for gc the perception is more affected by the customer orientation / support. the positive or negative relevance in the factors means a possible relevance of those factors in the overall perception for a give brand, but it doesnt necessarily mean that the brand is performing negatively regarding the attributes featuring the mentioned factors. note: the red circles underline the statistically significant differences from the overall mean. focus on brands the image contains a bar chart derived from the infographic presented in figure- the chart focuses on illustrating factors that influence brand perception compared to brand equity. the vertical axis represents the extent to which two specific factors influence brand perception, which are \"customer orientation / support\" and \"established reputation.\" these axes are depicted in contrasting colors: a light green bar represents \"customer orientation / support,\" while an orange bar represents \"established reputation.\" the horizontal axis lists six brands: dentsply sirona, ivocar, gc america, kerr, kulzer, ultradent, and voco. each brand is paired with two bars, one for \"customer orientation / support\" and one for \"established reputation,\" allowing for a direct comparison of the relative influences of these factors. for dentsply sirona, the bar for \"customer orientation / support\" is relatively short compared to the long bar for \"established reputation,\" indicating that reputation has a much greater influence on dentsply sirona's brand perception compared to factors associated with support and orientation. for ivocar, the \"customer orientation / support\" bar is short, and this pattern is consistent for ivocar, whereas its \"established reputation\" bar is not prominent but slightly longer than for dentsply sirona. for gc america, both bars are relatively low, indicating that neither factor has much impact on its brand perception. for kerr, the \"customer orientation / support\" bar is notably longer than the \"established reputation\" bar, showcasing its strength in providing support and orientation rather than its reputation. for kulzer, both factors have some impact, but the \"customer orientation / support\" bar is slightly longer, suggesting a marginally greater influence. for ultradent, the \"customer orientation / support\" bar is the longest, clearly outweighing the \"established reputation\" bar, signifying customer orientation and support as major factors influencing perception. for voco, the \"customer orientation / support\" bar is slightly shorter but overall seems competitive with the \"established reputation\" bar in impact. the image also includes a note indicating that the red circles highlight brands that have statistically significant differences from the overall mean, and thus could be inferred that these brands have more pronounced customer-oriented or reputation-based traits in their brand perceptions. the image contains a bar chart titled \"brand image: factor analysis,\" focusing on various brands' perceptions based on two factors: established reputation and customer orientation/support. the chart visually represents these factors using two types of bars: one in green for customer orientation/support and one in orange for established reputation, each represented by different lengths and overlaps across multiple brands listed at the bottom. the brands included in the study are 3m, dentspply, sirona, ivoclar, gc, kerr, kulze, ultradent, and voco. each brand has two overlapping bars corresponding to the two factors mentioned. the length of these bars can be indicative of the relative focus of consumers or experts on the brand's customer orientation/support and established reputation. notably, the chart notes where the bars overlap at certain heights indicated by red circles, which signify significant differences from the overall mean. specifically, one red circle is located prominently on the 3m brand's bar. this circle likely alerts viewers to noteworthy variances, highlighting an aspect where the brand diverges notably from average performance. the content of the image provides insight into how each brand scores across two critical dimensions related to their brand perception, offering a comparative analysis based on established reputation and customer orientation/support.", "type": "Document"}}
