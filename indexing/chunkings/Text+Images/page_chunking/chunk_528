16 base: 722 cases in overall, the majority of respondents think that - as it happens among dentists - that the cooperation will get tighter, due to the expertise of the technicians. slightly higher than the sample of dental practices is the percentage of respondents stating there will not be any change at all: the higher one is from spain, italy and france. again, the stance of german respondents is quite different from the other countries, where a higher share of respondents believe that the dentists will need to get more expert about prosthetics. the image contains a pie chart depicting the responses to a survey question regarding the future roles of dentists and technicians, specifically in relation to digital technologies. the pie chart is divided into four distinct sections, each representing a different percentage of the total responses: 58% of respondents believe that \"there will not be any change at all, because everyone will always have its own distinct role\" (indicated in light blue). 21% of respondents think \"the dentists will need to get more expertise about prosthetics\" (demonstrated in dark blue). 19% believe \"the dentists will need to get more expertise about prosthetics, because they will be required to perform part of the work in charge of technicians\" (also in dark blue, the slight difference is the specific reason provided). 2% were unsure and responded with \"don't know\" (depicted in the smallest dark gray section). this section of the page is designed to visually and numerically represent the public opinion on how the roles of dentists and technicians are expected to evolve with emerging digital technologies. the pie chart's layout makes it easily to understand the proportion of people holding different viewpoints at a glance. the image shown is a bar chart depicting the percentage of german (de), french (fr), italian (it), and uk respondents' opinions regarding the role of dentists and technicians in the future amidst new digital technologies. the chart breaks down the percentages into four response categories: \"there will not be any change at all,\" \"the cooperation between dentists and technicians will increase,\" \"the dentists will need to get more expertise about prosthetics, because they will be required to perform part of the work in charge of technicians,\" and \"don't know.\" the data appears as follows: **germany (de):** - 77% believe there won't be any change. - 18% believe that dentists will need to get more expertise in prosthetics. - 5% believe cooperation will increase. **france (fr):** - 39% believe there won't be any change. - 24% believe that dentists will need to get more expertise in prosthetics. - 4% believe cooperation will increase. **italy (it):** - 34% believe there won't be any change. - 24% believe that dentists will need to get more expertise in prosthetics. - 9% believe cooperation will increase. **uk (uk):** - 64% believe there won't be any change. - 15% believe that dentists will need to get more expertise in prosthetics. - 21% believe cooperation will increase. in summary, this chart indicates that the majority of respondents across these countries do not expect significant change but a notable portion in germany, france, and italy see an increased need for dentists to obtain expertise in prosthetics. meanwhile, a larger percentage of uk respondents anticipate more cooperation between dentists and technicians. the image contains a list of statements representing the survey responses on how dentists and technicians' roles will change with new digital technologies. the statements are categorized into four distinct responses: 1. **there will not be any change at all, because everyone will always have its own distinct role** 2. **the cooperation between dentists and technicians will increase because the knowledge of the technician in prosthetics materials, aesthetics, and digital processing are important** 3. **the dentists will need to get more expertise about prosthetics, because they will be required to perform part of the work in charge of technicians** 4. **don't know** these statements are used to interpret the responses in the pie charts and bar graphs in the first image. the survey respondents from germany, spain, italy, and the united kingdom were likely asked to select these answers on how they perceived the evolving roles of dentists and technicians with the advent of new digital technologies.", "type": "Document"}}
