(low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) prerequisites waste/inefficiency indifference key success factors its interesting to note that customer service oriented and affordable are important items in the definition of the recommendation, but they received lower than average scores, and they are positioned in the key success factors. the image contains a correlation analysis map titled \"brand image vs. recommendation: how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? overall brands\". this map is a graphical representation derived from two different charts that were previously discussed or visualized. the context provided explains that the map combines these charts and presents the correlation between the weight on recommendation and various items, evaluating them against different brands. the correlation analysis map illustrates this relationship by plotting multiple factors along two axes: the horizontal axis (weight on recommendation) and the vertical axis (items scores). the horizontal axis runs from low to high, indicating the importance or weight of each item in the recommendation. the vertical axis also spans from low to high, reflecting the score of each item, where low indicates lesser importance or performance and high indicates greater importance or higher performance. various descriptive boxes within the plot offer insights into the specific items being analyzed and their correlation with brand recommendation. important notable items marked and plotted on the map include: 1. **waste/ineefficiency**: this box is positioned towards the higher end on the vertical axis (high) and lower end on the horizontal axis (low). it indicates that this factor, while not critically important for recommendation, is considered more highly within brands. 2. **prerequisites**: located at the top right, this box is high on both axes, showing high importance for both brand recommendation and the factors evaluated. 3. **key success factors**: found at a higher position on both the vertical and horizontal axes, it represents critical items that significantly impact the recommendation analysis. 4. **too expensive**: this box is more towards the lower portion of the vertical axis and mid-point on the horizontal axis, denoting it as a moderately important but costly item. 5. **affordable**: this factor is slightly towards the higher portion of both axes, signifying it as an important yet affordable factor for recommendation. 6. **customer service oriented**: this box is lower on the vertical axis (less score) and mid on the horizontal axis (weight), indicating it as an important factor with average performance. 7. **good price quality ratio**: this is positioned moderately high on the vertical axis but lower on the horizontal, reflecting a relatively important factor that has a favorable balance between price and quality. scattered across the maps are various interconnected dots representing specific brands. these dots are colored and plotted at specific points based on where they score highest or lowest on the factors of the map. the dots offer a visual representation of where each brand stands concerning these factors, helping to compare and contrast their positions. overall, the image showcases a comprehensive analysis tool designed to understand how various factors and items contribute to the brand's recommendation value, aiding in strategic decision-making and performance improvement across brands.", "type": "Document"}}
