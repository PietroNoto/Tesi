marked by a detailed table, explains and clarifies the data presented in the pie charts above it. it specifically deals with the response rate of individuals involved in chairside milling who use digital technology and those who don't. in this segment, the total number of responses is represented along with various demographic breakdowns. it notes that 86% of the responses did not indicate any chairside milling unit brands used, while only 14% did. this information is divided across different geographic locations and sectors, giving a detailed insight into regional and sector-based usage patterns. moreover, the table provides the demographic breakdown into age categories (italy, spain, and uk). for instance, in italy, 82% did not use chairside milling brands, whereas in spain, this percentage decreased to 89%, and in the uk, all respondents did not use any brands. the sectors represented show varying usage as well. in the medical sector (it), 43% reported not using any brand, in the education sector (sp), 63% did not, and in the other sector (uk), all did not indicate any usage. this detailed categorization helps in understanding how the usage of digital chairside milling brands differs across various regions and sectors. the breakdown underscores the adoption patterns, with italy showing a higher percentage of non-users, potentially indicating a less saturated market or lower investment in such technology in that region. the image contains what appears to be a bar chart detailing the brand distribution for \"chairside milling\" units. the bar chart breaks down the proportion of various brands used by respondents. the x-axis lists the brands, while the y-axis represents the percentage of respondents using each brand. 1. **sirona**: dominates the chart with a 71% usage rate. the bar extends mostly along the entire chart, indicating that sirona is the most widely used chairside milling unit by the participants. 2. **planmeca**: occupies the second position with 8%. its bar is shorter than that of sirona but still noticeably extending. 3. **kavo**: shows 4% usage, a little shorter than the planmeca bar. 4. **amann girrbach**: also has 4%, the same as kavo, with its bar aligning similarly in length to kavo's. 5. **other**: represents combined usage of less common brands with 2%. 6. **don't know / no answer**: accounts for 11% of the sample, signifying respondents who did not specify their brand choice or were unsure. the exact placement of the bars against the numerical scale aids in visually estimating the percentage of respondents associated with each brand. the consistent width across the chart suggests uniform data accuracy for each brand reported. this image is part of a report from omnivision digital, given that the watermark and page header are visible in a larger image that contains the chart as a segment. the report includes the title 'brand numeric distribution: chairside milling' and seems to be addressing survey data points relevant to dental industry products. the detailed percentage breakdown is meant to provide insights into brand preference in chairside milling technology among professionals in the dental industry. the image contains a doughnut chart titled \"brand numeric distribution: chairside milling unit\" which appears to be a data visualization extracted from a larger document or report. the chart is meant to illustrate the percentage of respondents who use different brands in the sector of chairside milling units. the chart is segmented into three data points, each represented by a percentage and indicated by the word \"yes\" in a smaller segment at the bottom of the chart. there are three sections: the majority of the chart is occupied by a large segment labeled \"no,\" indicating that 96% of respondents do not use a specific brand in the chairside milling unit context. a much smaller segment labeled \"yes\" accounts for 4% of the total responses, implying that 4% of respondents use a specific brand in question. the remaining 2% is labeled \"don't know / no answer,\" indicating respondents who were uncertain or unable to answer the question. the chart's presentation is straightforward, showing a clear disparity between the respondents who use a distinct brand versus those who do not. the use of distinct shading and segmentation helps differentiate these data points visually, aiding in understanding at a glance. the chart is accompanied by a text box on the right that defines the numeric distribution in the context of client brand usage. this box reads, \"it is the percentage of clients that mentioned to use a certain product/ brand, or to get delivered by a certain supplier. thats why it is comparable with the coverage index, which is a subjective value, which is named by the clients as their product or their supplier.\"", "type": "Document"}}
