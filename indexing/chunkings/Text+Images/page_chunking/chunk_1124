base: 144 (respondents who do not have ios) backwardness: this driver encompasses elements that seem unrelated and may appear trivial, but from the researchers' perspective, it represents a single driver of justifications rooted in biases rather than real issues. expensiveness: the problems in this area are related to convenience, where excessive investment is predominant, but also include concerns about technology evolution, although with a low correlation, and model printing. resistance to change: this area encompasses issues related to mindset, in particular potential biases and prejudices from both dentists and their laboratories. compatibility: this factor includes aspects related to compatibility with certain software or aligner systems. full arch issues: the issues falling under this factor are related to full arches, including aspects related to the ergonomics of the handpiece and long working times. non-owners only drivers of resistance the resistances are grouped into subjective and objective drivers cross loading: when certain items are present in two factors, it means that they partially contribute to both drivers. the numerical values refer to the degree of correlation (mean 0, variance +/-1). the second image contains a table titled \"barriers for non-owner prospects factor analysis,\" which is a part of the larger content depicted in the first image. the table is organized into four columns and lists several factors that impede the progress or success of non-owner prospects in dental offices. each factor includes a numerical value that presumably represents the level of resistance or difficulty associated with it. here is a detailed breakdown of the content of the second image in the context of the first one: ### table breakdown: #### columns: 1. **backwardness** (topmost column, labeled in turquoise) 2. **expensiveness** (second column from the top, labeled in a slightly darker shade of blue) 3. **resistance to change** (third column from the top, labeled in a lighter shade of grey) 4. **compatibility** (bottommost column in teal) 5. **full-arch issues** (fourth column from the top, labeled in a pale green) #### factors and values: **internet connection issues**: 0.738 (backwardness), 0.806 (expensiveness), 0.418 (resistance to change), 0.400 (compatibility), 0.400 (full-arch issues) **handpiece size and poor ergonomics**: 0.502 (backwardness), 0.492 (expensiveness), 0.618 (resistance to change), 0.400 (compatibility), 0.400 (full-arch issues) **digital-only work archiving is not secure**: 0.554 (backwardness), 0.454 (expensiveness), 0.338 (resistance to change), 0.400 (compatibility), 0.400 (full-arch issues) **low reliability of the digital workflow**: 0.492 (backwardness), 0.492 (expensiveness), 0.514 (resistance to change), 0.400 (compatibility), 0.400 (full-arch issues) **backward laboratory not oriented towards digital**: 0.444 (backwardness), 0.444 (expensiveness), 0.343 (resistance to change), 0.400 (compatibility), 0.400 (full-arch issues) **the economic investment is excessive**: 0.806 (backwardness), 0.806 (expensiveness), 0.343 (resistance to change), 0.400 (compatibility), 0.400 (full-arch issues) **technology is still evolving and risk of early obsolescence**: 0.440 (backwardness), 0.734 (expensiveness), 0.418 (resistance to change), 0.400 (compatibility), 0.400 (full-arch issues) **high costs for model printing**: 0.735 (backwardness), 0.735 (expensiveness), 0.333 (resistance to change), 0.400 (compatibility), 0.400 (full-arch issues) **the learning curve is long and/or difficult**: 0.683 (backwardness), 0.514 (expensiveness), 0.418 (resistance to change), 0.618 (compatibility), 0.418 (full-arch issues) **longer work times**: 0.514 (backwardness), 0.514 (expensiveness), 0.418 (resistance to change), 0.600 (compatibility), 0.418 (full-arch issues) **managing change within the team**: 0.705 (backwardness), 0.343 (expensiveness), 0.343 (resistance to change), 0.618 (compatibility), 0.418 (full-arch issues) **being forced to use only certain software, or workflows**: 0.618 (backwardness), 0.343 (expensiveness), 0.343 (resistance to change), 0.788 (compatibility), 0.400 (full-arch issues) **being forced to use only certain aligners**: 0.343 (backwardness), 0.343 (expensiveness), 0.343 (resistance to change), 0.788 (compatibility), 0.400 (full-arch issues) **not suitable for extensive impressions and full arches**: 0.654 (backwardness), 0.343 (expensiveness), 0.400 (resistance to change), 0.400 (compatibility), 0.400 (full-arch issues) ### analysis and description: each factor involves specific challenges", "type": "Document"}}
