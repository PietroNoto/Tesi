70% total, 3% partial, and 34% no agreement, presented in similar colors\u2014dark blue for total and light blue for partial agreement. - a smaller secondary comparison in the trend analysis section shows a 4.0/7.0 for percentage total agreement and 3.1/0.5 for percentage partial agreement for 2018 versus 2015 (values are likely ratios or numbers). the overall message conveyed here is to highlight the satisfaction and effectiveness of 3d printing in dentistry over time, using graphical means to demonstrate improved agreement or acceptance of 3d printed items compared to previous practices. in summary, this detailed image illustrates the growing acceptance of 3d-imprinted elements in orthodontic treatment with specific data points and comparative analyses. the image contains a snippet of text from a presentation slide, labeled \"n\u00ba 28,\" likely part of a larger document or presentation on the implications of 3d technology for odontology. the slide is titled \"principales consecuencias de la impresi\u00f3n 3d para la odontolog\u00eda,\" or \"main consequences of 3d printing for dentistry.\" key points on the slide are presented in three segments, focusing on three aspects of 3d technology usage in dental practices: 1. **immediacy of material and process production:** - the slide discusses how digitally producing materials and processes improves immediacy. a bar chart comparing percentages between two years (likely 2018 and 2015) shows that this immediacy increased. the chart highlights that the production time has become more expedient over time, although not without certain challenges and discrepancies among media. 2. **workflow efficiency and flexibility:** - workflows have become more efficient and flexible with the use of 3d printing. the data indicates some fluctuation\u2014some aspects show increased efficiency and other aspects show slight drops or remain stable over the years. the slide notes that while the immediate benefits of reduced production costs are visible, there can be complications in materials and software quality compared to cad-cam blocks, affecting overall outcomes. 3. **cost reduction in simulations:** - there has been a notable reduction in simulation costs due to the use of 3d printing. the slide notes that while there are increased benefits on cost reduction, certain elements of cost comparison such as simulation show fluctuation, suggesting improvements yet with areas requiring further optimization. in summary, the second image within the context of the first image focuses on the technical improvements and cost-effectiveness of 3d printing in dental procedures. however, it also identifies that there remain some complexities and areas of development to address fully.", "type": "Document"}}
