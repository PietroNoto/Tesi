23% 2. **from r9,001 to r17,000** - 18% 3. **more than r17,001** - 25% 4. **don't know, no answer** - 34% each segment of the pie chart is clearly labeled with a corresponding percentage, indicating the distribution of monthly consumable material expenses among the sample population. the chart is presented in shades of blue in segments with gray for the \"don't know\" category, which is the largest segment by percentage. the image contains a pie chart that is titled \"internal laboratory\". this pie chart is a visual representation of responses to a survey question, showing the distribution of respondents who indicated whether they work in collaboration with an external laboratory. *detailed description of the second image:** **general structure**: the pie chart displays a split into two main segments, each represented by a different shade of blue. one segment is much larger than the other, indicating a predominance of one response over the other. **segment colors and percentages**: - the largest segment is blue and occupies a substantial portion of the pie chart, specifically 82%, as labeled next to it. - the smaller segment is also blue with an 18% label adjacent to it. **legend**: below the pie chart, there is a legend with two keys: - **blue color** with the label \"yes\": indicates the proportion of respondents who answered that they work in collaboration with an external laboratory. - **dark blue color** with the label \"no, we work in collaboration with an external laboratory\": indicates the proportion of respondents who answered that they do not work with external laboratories. **proportion comparison**: the significant 82% for \"yes\" suggests that the majority of respondents collaborate with external laboratories, while the 18% for \"no\" suggests fewer respondents do not collaborate with external laboratories. **other elements**: the image background is plain, likely white, focusing all attention on the pie chart and the legend. *relevance to first image**: the second image, in the context of the first image, highlights the primary responses to a survey question about working with an external laboratory. this correlates with the demographic and income distribution pie charts shown in the first image, suggesting insights into how different social classes or financial brackets may interact with external laboratories. the large proportion of respondents working with external laboratories might indicate a reliance on external resources, possibly tied to the economic parameters (mean monthly revenue as shown in the first image) that might necessitate this collaboration.", "type": "Document"}}
