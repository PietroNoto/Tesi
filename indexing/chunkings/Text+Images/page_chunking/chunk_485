satisfaction score for a software product, focusing on the \"completely satisfied\" category. the chart contrasts the satisfaction levels across four different companies: overall satisfaction, open technologies, amann girbach, and 3shape. the data is displayed in the format of percentage scores for 538 quotes for the overall satisfaction, 50 quotes for open technologies, 30 quotes for amann girbach, and 26 quotes for 3shape. *overall (538 quotes):** the overall satisfaction category shows a negative sentiment with a percentage of (-) 11%. the majority of categories exhibit negative responses, as indicated by the predominantly red bars, which range between -2% to -11%, indicating dissatisfaction. *open technologies (50 quotes):** positive sentiment for open technologies is shown with a percentage of 16%. numerous categories have negative responses with percentages like -3%, -4%, and -11%, yet relatively, the green bars show greater positive response compared to the other companies. *amann girbach (30 quotes):** the category for \"compleely satisfied\" indicates a very positive score of 29%. the majority of the sentiment is negative with -9% in several categories,

rated by the respondents. the first bar at the top shows a 16% rating from the company, followed by a 9% rating. the central segment of the chart includes a 2% rating and another 2% rating, both
