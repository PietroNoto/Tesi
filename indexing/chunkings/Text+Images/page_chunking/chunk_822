the pie chart contains four discrete sections, each represented by a different color. 2. **yes, and we use it often**: - this category is indicated by a dark blue color. the corresponding percentage (57%) signifies the segment of respondents who use the 3d printer frequently. 3. **yes, but we rarely use it**: - this category is depicted by a light blue color. the percentage assigned to this segment is 19%, illustrating the responses from respondents who have a 3d printer but use it infrequently. 4. **no, but we plan to buy it**: - this is represented by an orange color. it comprises 10% of the responses, showing the respondents who have not yet purchased a 3d printer but plan to do so in the future. 5. **no, and we have not yet planned to purchase it**: - the final category is indicated by a violet color. this section accounts for 14% of the responses, highlighting those who do not have any current or planned purchases of a 3d printer. 6. **legend**: - the legend of the pie chart, displayed next to the chart, offers a key to decoding the segments represented by different colors, which further aids in understanding the distribution and breakdown of responses. *interrelationship with the first image:** the first image, shown in its entirety, provides a more comprehensive context. it is a bar chart showing statistics on the penetration and intention to buy of desktop scanners, cad-cam milling units, and 3d printers across various european countries with germany, france, italy, spain, and the uk. the 3d printer category in the list indicates that 57% of the respondents have used a 3d printer often, aligning directly with the data segment for this color from the pie chart. the overall layout features three distinct 3d printer bar charts at the top center, each representing a different european country, and then a horizontal sequence of percentage values for each country in relation to each device type. the dark blue percentage 57% for the use of 3d printers matches precisely with the \"yes, and we use it often\" segment from the pie chart. in conclusion, the pie chart within the second image simplifies the usage intention regarding 3d printers, offering the viewer a snapshot of current usage habits and future plans within a broader statistical context. the image contains a pie chart, which provides a visual breakdown of a data set. the pie chart is segmented into four distinct sections, each representing a different proportion of the data. the central part of the chart, approximately 57%, is occupied by a large blue segment. this segment is labeled with the number \"10%\" and \"9%\" in adjacent small pink segments. a significant portion of the pie chart is taken up by a large brown segment, which constitutes roughly 19% of the pie. adjacent to the brown segment is a smaller pink segment, marked with the number \"15%.\" the final segment, which is medium-sized and light blue in color, represents a proportion of the data of 21%, with the number \"10%\" labeled within it. to the left of the pie chart, there is a legend detailing the significance of the different colors and associated percentage numbers. this legend describes how each segment's color corresponds to a statement or category: light green with \"10%\" signifies \"yes, and we use it often,\" brown with \"19%\" indicates \"yes, but we rarely use it,\" blue with \"15%\" represents \"no, but we plan to buy it,\" and pinkish blue with \"21%\" signifies \"no, and we have not yet planned to purchase it.\" overall, the pie chart is designed with clear, distinct markers to distinguish the four categories visually. the legend is directly associated with the pie chart, allowing viewers to easily interpret the specific proportions and corresponding statements for each color code directly from the chart. the image contains a series of vertical bar graphs labeled \"3d printer penetration breakdown by country.\" these graphs show the distribution of response categories concerning the use of 3d printers within different european countries: germany, france, italy, spain, and the uk. each graph consists of four bars of varying colors representing different responses to a survey question. the legend at the top left of the image labels the colors with their respective meanings: dark blue indicates \"yes, and we use it often.\" dark orange indicates \"yes, but we rarely use it.\" light blue indicates \"no, but we plan to buy it.\" orange indicates \"no, and we have not yet planned to purchase it.\" the top-right corner has another pie chart that mirrors this legend, further dividing the responses into the same categories along with the count for each. below is the detailed breakdown for each county: ### germany: dark blue: 55% - \"yes, and we use it often\" dark orange: 8% - \"yes, but we rarely use it.\" light blue: 21% - \"no, but we plan to buy it.\" orange: 16% - \"no, and we have not yet planned to purchase it.\" ### france: dark blue: 69% - \"yes, and we use it often\" dark orange: 10% - \"yes, but we rarely use it.\" light blue: 14% - \"no, but we plan to buy it.\" orange: 8% - \"no, and we have not yet planned to purchase it.\" ### italy: dark blue: 47% - \"yes, and we use it often\" dark orange: 10% - \"yes, but we rarely use it.\" light blue: 14% - \"no, but we plan to buy it.\" orange: 29% - \"no, and we have not yet planned to purchase it.\" ### spain: dark blue: 51% - \"yes, and we use it often\" dark orange: 7% - \"yes, but we rarely use it.\" light blue: 15% - \"no, but we plan to buy it.\" orange: 26% - \"no, and we have not yet planned to purchase it.\" ### united kingdom: dark blue: 62% - \"yes, and we use it often\" dark orange: 9% - \"yes, but we rarely use it.\" light blue: 16% - \"no, but we plan to buy it.\" orange: 13% - \"no, and we have not yet planned to purchase it.\" from the data, it is evident that while the dark blue (indicating frequent use) represents the majority of users in all countries, italy and spain show relatively moderate response rates with a large number of respondents still in the \"no, and we have not yet planned to purchase it\" category. the percentage of people who intend to buy or already have bought a 3d printer ranges from as low as 10% to as high as 29%, with france showing the lowest purchase plans. the image contains a pie chart that illustrates a breakdown by country, showing the percentage usage and intention to purchase digital devices for digital workflow production. in this chart, three segments represent various categories: usage, infrequent usage, and intention to purchase. **75%** corresponds to the segment with the largest piece, suggesting that a majority of respondents do not use or rarely use these digital devices. **13%** is allocated to the middle segment, indicating that a relatively sizeable proportion of respondents are infrequent users of these devices. **6%** each is dedicated to two smaller segments, denoting that a lesser percentage are planning to purchase these devices but are not currently using or using them infrequently. this pie chart is part of a larger context provided by the first image, which offers a more comprehensive visual summary with additional data points. the larger context features multiple pie charts and bar graphs, each focused on different digital devices and their penetration levels across various countries. the first image displays the combined data regarding desktop scanners, cad-cam milling units, and 3d printers. key features of this second pie chart: **color coding**: orange for infrequent usage, gray for intention to purchase, and blue for no usage. **percentage labels**: clearly marked numbers for each segment: 75% (blue), 13% (orange), 6% (gray), and 6% (gray). **consistency**: the blue sector maintains a consistent appearance throughout the charts, ensuring easy comparison. to summarize, this pie chart indicates a significant majority do not use digital devices for digital workflow production, with a smaller portion being infrequent users, and a very small percentage showing interest in purchasing. the image shows a collection of five vertical bar charts divided into seven columns. these bar charts represent the usage of digital devices, specifically focusing on desktop scanners, cad-cam milling units, and 3d printers across five countries. here is a breakdown: 1. **columns (from left to right):** - **germany**: the largest bar representing 79% usage of desktop scanners. the next bars show 6%, 6%, and 10% for cad-cam milling units and 3d printers, respectively. - **france**: the second largest bar indicating 73% usage of desktop scanners. 12% of the respondents use cad-cam milling units and 6% use 3d printers. - **italy**: displaying 75% for desktop scanners, 6% for cad-cam units, and 6% for 3d printers. - **spain**: significantly lower with 66% for desktop scanners, 10% for cad-cam units, and 5% for 3d printers. - **uk**: shows 83% for desktop scanners, which is higher than all other countries. only 5% usage is highlighted for cad-cam units and 11% for 3d printers. 2. **bars and labels:** - each bar graph is segmented into distinct parts representing different perceptions or actions: - dark blue: indicates respondents who use a device 'a lot' (referred to as 'yes, and we use it often'). - medium blue: represents respondents who use a device 'less often' (labeled 'yes, but we rarely use it'). - light brown: shows respondents who plan to buy the device (labeled 'no, but we plan to buy it'). - dark brown: indicates respondents with no plan for purchase (marked as 'no, and we have not yet planned to purchase it'). 3. **analysis highlights:** - **desktop scanners**: germany shows the highest usage of all three device types among the surveyed countries. this suggests strong existing adoption in germany possibly due to cad technology penetration being higher in the country. - **cad-cam milling units**: italy stands out with the highest usage rate of 12% compared to other countries with relatively lower adoption rates. - **3d printers**: the uk has the highest penetration of 11% for 3d printers, followed by italy with only 7%. 4. **further insights:** - penetration rates indicate varying levels of adoption but not necessarily industrial or scientific usage levels. - intention to buy is lower but still present, suggesting potential future investment or adoption trends. this detailed breakdown encompasses the observed trends, usage rates, and intended purchases of digital devices across different european countries as depicted in the image. the image contains a pie chart that presents the penetrations of different digital devices across four categories in a lab setting. the chart is divided into different segments color-coded and labeled with percentages representing the usage and purchase intentions. here is a detailed breakdown of the content: 1. **overall layout**: - **title**: digital devices penetration breakdown by country - **source and background details**: located at the upper left corner and at the bottom, it cites \"omnivision\" as the digital service provider, indicating detailed analysis by laboratories producing fixed prostheses. - **laboratory data**: the text specifies a base of 594 cases for the presented data. - **legend**: located at the bottom center, the legend categorizes different responses: - \"yes, and we use it often\" - \"yes, but we rarely use it\" - \"no, but we plan to buy it\" - \"no, and we have not yet planned to purchase it\" 2. **percentage breakdown**: - **desktop scanner penetration**: 47%. - \"yes, and we use it often\" (blue): 66% - **cad-cam milling unit penetration**: 34%. - \"yes, and we use it often\" (blue): 53% - \"yes, but we rarely use it\" (teal): 6% - **3d printer penetration**: 13%. - \"yes, and we use it often\" (blue): 19% - \"yes, but we rarely use it\" (teal): 19% - \"no, but we plan to buy it\" (orange): 15% 3. **country-specific data**: - the image also provides the total data aggregated across different countries: - germany: 79% desktop scanner, 46% cad-cam milling, 9% 3d printer - france: 66%, 13%, 15% - italy: 49% desktop scanner, 38% 3d printer, 13% cad-cam milling - spain: 36% desktop scanner, 35% 3d printer, 24% cad-cam milling 4. **key insights**: - **penetration disparities**: desktop scanners are most prevalent, followed by cad-cam milling units, with 3d printers being far less utilized. - **usage vs. purchase intentions**: - there is a clear trend where a sizable portion of laboratories does not use some technologies like cad-cam milling but plans to buy them. - the 3d printers exhibit low penetration but high purchase interest. - the 3d printers reflect an emphasis on lower financial investment but need more emphasis on showcasing their utility. the image provides a detailed but comparative analysis of digital devices in labs by considering both current usage patterns and future intentions for purchase. the specific categories and segments offer insights into trends and potential market opportunities within these technological niches. the image contains a bar chart comparing data on \"digital devices penetration breakdown by country\" across five european countries: germany, france, italy, spain, and the uk. the chart is derived from the original digital content page and contains two key graphics: a pie chart and a horizontal bar chart. ### pie chart: **desktop scanner penetration:** -
