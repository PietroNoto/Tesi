sample composition 2/2 7 the number of interviews conducted in each country were about 200 as shown here on the right (a). the weight of the surveyed countries regarding the dental practices is shown at (b). the overall results (only the overall ones) must be representative of the total universe (all countries investigated) which the sample refers to, as if we were to interview the whole universe. if we assume that the number of dental practices is a reliable indication of the weight of a given country, we need to make sure that each countrys sample weights as much as the number of the surgeries for that country, out of the total evaluated countries. in this case, since the natural weight of the interviews in each country is different from the weight of the parameter considered, we have to apply a multiplying factor (it can be more or less than 1) to the number of performed interviews in each country, so that, only for the overall results, the weighted interviews are consistent with the parameter used. the resulting number of weighted interviews is then shown at (c). it is important to underline that the weights are applied only when the overall results are considered. the charts showing the data of the single countries, are always referred to the actual interviews performed (a). country weighted cases % germany 333 33% france 191 19% italy 261 26% spain 136 14% united kingdom 80 8% total 1.000 100% country cases % germany 197 20% france 229 23% italy 198 20% spain 201 20% united kingdom 175 18% total 1.000 100% country practices % germany 47.900 33% france 27.500 19% italy 37.500 26% spain 19.500 14% united kingdom 11.500 8% total 143.900 100% (a) (b) (c) the image contains a bar graph titled \"introduction - sample composition 2/2.\" it is split into two primary sections: (a) and (b), with additional (c) in the lower right corner. each section and part (a), (b), and (c) contains two subcategories detailing different types of data. the chart uses vertical bars to visually represent percentages associated with different countries (de, fr, it, sp, uk). in section (a), the title \"cases\" indicates the percentage distribution, with the following values displayed in each country: germany: 33% france: 23% italy: 33% spain: 20% united kingdom: 33% total: 100% in section (b), the title \"practices\" specifies the proportional distribution within each country, with the following values: germany: 33% france: 19% italy: 26% spain: 14% united kingdom: 8% total: 100% the third section (c) illustrates the \"weighted cases\" with corresponding percentages. similar to (a), each country receives a calculated weighted percentage based on the number of interviews within that country: germany: 33% france: 19% italy: 26% spain: 13% united kingdom: 8% total: 100% the graph uses clear visual representation to depict that certain countries are contributing a higher percentage of cases and practices within the overall sample. the bars are color-coded in a uniformed style with all three charts collectively addressing different aspects of the sample composition. the image shows a bar graph representing the percentages of practices reported across different european countries. the graph is labeled along the vertical axis and the horizontal axis, with countries de (germany), fr (france), it (italy), sp (spain), and uk (united kingdom) listed along the horizontal axis. each bar corresponds to a country, and each bar's height represents the percentage of dentists reporting that the dental practice they work in is representative of practices in their given country. the countries and their corresponding percentages are as follows: de (germany): 20% fr (france): 23% it (italy): 20% sp (spain): 20% uk (united kingdom): 18% the graph is depicted in solid blue bars against a white and grey background. each country's bar is positioned below its respective label, and the percentages are indicated at the top of each bar. the graph seems to be simplified and lacks further details such as data points, explanatory notes, or titles, which would typically accompany a full-fledged infographic. each bar's width is visually proportional to the indicated percentage, with germany and the united kingdom having the lowest and highest percentages respectively in the sample. the layout suggests a straightforward comparative format, presenting the percentage of practices considered representative in an easy-to-interpret bar chart format.", "type": "Document"}}
