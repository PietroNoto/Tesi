planea empezar a hacerlo el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o. el porcentaje incrementa entre laboratorios con tres o m\u00e1s prot\u00e9sicos (31%) y entre quienes declaran una percepci\u00f3n positive con

n\u00facleo duro que sigue siendo adverso a ellas, tal y como demuestra el liger\u00edsimo cambio experimentado desde 2015 (16%) hasta 2018 (18%). las diferencias inferiores a +/- 2% podr\u00edan no

into two sections, with the majority representing the proportion of respondents who do not intend to purchase the product, and a smaller portion representing those who do intend to purchase it. the pie chart comprises two sections: **no**: this section occupies the larger portion of the pie chart, indicating that 82% of the respondents do not intend to purchase the product. **yes**: the smaller portion of the pie chart, representing 18% of the respondents, indicates that they do intend to purchase the product. below the pie chart, there are some explanatory text that provides context for the data presented: \"\u00a1planea empezar a prover un elemento de prueba fijo productos con tecnolog\u00edas digitales a lo largo del pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o?\" which translates to \"are you planning to start testing a fixed element product with digital technologies over the next year?\" an arrow pointing to the pie chart emphasizes the statistic of 82% of users not planning to test the product, highlighting a significant portion of the target market. the image appears to be related to market research or consumer behavior studies, focusing on the product's adoption rate among users, specifically concerning the use of digital technologies with a fixed product element trial over the coming year. this pie chart is part of a broader visual content that likely includes additional graphs and text segments that provide deeper insights into consumer behavior, market trends, and product acceptance rates concerning digital technology integration. the image contains a pie chart labeled \"intenci\u00f3n de compra de las tecnolog\u00edas,\" which translates to \"intention to purchase technologies.\" the chart is predominantly composed of shades of blue, indicating the percentage of respondents who have a positive intention to purchase technology (blue) and those with a negative intention (white). the pie chart indicates the following percentages: 16% of respondents have a positive intention to purchase. 84% of respondents have a negative intention to purchase. additionally, there are two bars on the left side of the image: a blue bar indicating that 10% of respondents have the intention to purchase digital technologies. a smaller bar showing an additional 8% of respondents who intend to collaborate with other laboratories equipped with these technologies. another segment of the image includes a text box summarizing key points related to technology purchase intentions: 18% of those who expressed a negative intention will not purchase technologies within the coming year. a 27% incremental increase in the number of laboratories with more than three projects (31%). only 7% have never proclaimed that they used digital technologies in projects, implying a significant rise in digital technology usage since increased digital productivity in 2012 alone resulted in a 31% decrease in the number of non-purchased projects. a growing number of studies conducted with digital technologies by 2015, and the significant increase in investments post- the pie chart itself is large, dominating the visual space, and positioned towards the top right of the main text segment. the accompanying chart appears to provide a summary or continuation of broader statistics likely related to the impact and trend of technology usage among respondents based on the context provided by the accompanying information. the image contains a histogram with four distinct sections, each representing different responses to survey questions. the responses are labeled in spanish and depicted with percentages. here's the detailed content of the second image: the light blue section labeled \"yes\" shows that 10% of respondents answer they compare digital technologies positively. the green section labeled \"no\" indicates that 82% of respondents do not compare digital technologies at all. the light purple section labeled \"if, also with lab colleagues\" has a percentage of 8%, though it's unclear whether this is the positive or negative response, as it falls within the no response category. the remaining content of the second image, aside from this part, is largely obscured and not present in the cropped portion of the image.", "type": "Document"}}
