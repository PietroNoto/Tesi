why not? 60 base: 256 cases the lack of need and the preference for the traditional method are the most important quotes. certainly the pricing still is rationally felt to be a barrier on entry, but most of the respondents feel either theres no need or the traditional method will work as well. the image contains a bar chart that is used to illustrate various reasons for reluctance in the adoption or implementation of digital technology over a period of two years. it appears to be a continuation of the primary slide depicted in the first main image, which provides a more detailed representation of specific factors that influence this decision. the chart at the bottom, shown twice for comparison purposes, illustrates reasons given by respondents on why they are not interested in using digital technology soon. these reasons are represented by horizontal bars, where the length of each bar corresponds to the percentage of respondents who have cited that specific reason. below is the detailed explanation based on the chart: *reasons for not using digital technology within 2 years:** 1. **i don't need it**: with a substantial percentage of 51%, this is the most commonly stated reason cited by respondents. it reflects that they see no immediate necessity for adopting digital technologies. 2. **i prefer the traditional method**: this reason is selected by 19% of people, indicating that for these individuals, the traditional methods are more comfortable or perceived as more effective than digital alternatives. 3. **too expensive**: seventeen percent of respondents are influenced by the high costs associated with digital technology, which can be a significant barrier, especially for smaller businesses or individuals who might not have the budget. 4. **low demand**: representing 13% of the responses, the observation that there is a low demand for the technology means respondents feel there is minimal or no need to invest in digital solutions. 5. **poor system precision**: this reason is selected by 2% of the respondents. they concern themselves with issues of precision in the current digital setup, preferring improvements before adoption. 6. **poor familiarity with technologies**: it is selected by just 1% of the respondents, which indicates that its a minor factor and implies existing skill sets or comfort levels with digital tools. 7. **i have other priority**: only 0% of respondents cited this reason, suggesting that in this context, digital technology is not competing with other high-priority efforts. 8. **other**: a minor category with 2% of respondents, indicating other less common reasons not explicitly listed on the chart. 9. **dont know**: similarly, a non-factor with a negligible 0%, which suggests respondents were certain in their decision-making process regarding the adoption of digital technology. *additional context from the first image:** at the top of the page, the first main image provides graphical support with a pie chart breaking down the reasons for not wanting to start using digital technology. a large majority of respondents, about 82%, are in favor of not employing digital technology (labelled as \"no\"). of the remaining 18%, 6% are willing to use digital technology but unsure, and only 12% show a willingness to start within two years. the descriptive text from the first main image underscores that the \"most important quotes\" by respondents revolve around the lack of need and preference for traditional methods. this is corroborated by the chart in the bottom section, emphasizing points about traditional methods being satisfactory and priced reasonably, which together are perceived as beneficial barriers rather than hindrances by most respondents. *summary and integration:** the primary visual message of the image is that a substantial majority, almost two-thirds of the respondents, have no immediate interest in adopting digital technology over the next two years. there is a clear dominating perspective that traditional methods are adequate and often more cost-effective, reinforcing why there is minimal interest in transitioning to digital setups amid existing needs and existing comfortable systems. this perspective is further reinforced by the pie chart supporting the broader data, reflecting a dominant but scattered group of people willing to adopt digital technology within two years. the image contains a pie chart in the design of a larger infographic. the main title of the infographic, located in the upper left corner, is \"technology intention to buy: why not,\" which suggests the pie chart in question is part of a study on people's attitudes towards adopting digital technology. at the top, the larger infographic poses a straightforward question: \"are you willing to start using digital technology within 2 years? why not?\" below this, there is a pie chart that visually represents the respondents' answers to the question. the pie chart is divided into four segments, each indicating a different reason for a 'no' response. 1. **no (82%)** - the largest segment, colored in plain dark blue without labels. 2. **yes (12%)** - the second largest segment, colored in a lighter blue, with \"yes\" clearly labeled. 3. **don't know (6%)** - a smaller segment in light purple, labeled \"don't know.\" 4. **other (1%)** - the smallest segment, colored in a darker purple, labeled \"other.\" beneath the pie chart, there is an explanatory text that states, \"the lack of need and the preference for the traditional method are the most important quotes. certainly the pricing still is ratings to be a barrier on entry, but most of the respondents feel there's no need or the traditional method will work as well.\" this statement suggests that the study was conducted through 256 cases and provides insights into the respondents' motivations and concerns regarding digital technologies. the image also includes the company names \"omnivision\" at the bottom left and \"key-stone\" at the bottom right, possibly crediting the creators or sponsor of the research. the infographic overall is meant to convey detailed feedback on the respondents' attitudes towards adopting digital technology.", "type": "Document"}}
