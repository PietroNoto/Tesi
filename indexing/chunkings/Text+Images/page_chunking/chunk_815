**x-axis**: the x-axis of the bar chart lists various items of importance, each corresponding to a satisfaction score. these items include: - **accuracy and overall quality of the restorations** - **reliability** - **wide range of materials available** - **wide range of procedures available** - **makes daily practice easier** - **handiness/ ease of use** - **technical assistance in case of repair** - **technical support from the company** - **productivity increase** - **compatibility with other brands** - **y-axis**: the y-axis is labeled \"items importance\" and includes numerical values corresponding to the importance scores of these items. - each item's importance score is represented by the length of the corresponding bar, with longer bars indicating higher importance scores. 3. **item scores**: - each item is accompanied by a satisfaction score, derived from user input or feedback: - **accuracy and overall quality of the restorations**: 0,814 - **reliability**: 0,797 - **wide range of materials available**: 0,485 - **wide range of procedures available**: 0,548 - **makes daily practice easier**: 0,689 -
