years? if not, why? non-owners base: 279 cases base: 223 cases intention to buy the majority of the respondents have mentioned the expensiveness as the most relevant resistance to buy. also, it is remarkable that a relevant percentage of respondents is not interested or believes that 3d printing is not a must have technology. 65 the image contains two main components: an infographic and accompanying statistics in a pie chart format. ### pie chart description: *title & context:** the infographic is titled \"technology intention to buy: 3d printing unit.\" it is asking the question, \"are you willing to purchase a 3d printing unit within 2 years? if not, why?\" and is specifically tailored to non-owners of 3d printing units. *layout & structure:** the pie chart is divided into two main sections: 1. **intention to buy (20%):** represented in blue, this segment is relatively small, indicating a minority preference towards purchasing a 3d printing unit within the next two years. 2. **no intent to buy (80%):** represented in purple, covering the vast majority of the pie chart, indicating the most common response with a clear majority against purchasing a 3d printing unit. ### additional statistics: below the pie chart, there is a horizontal bar graph that provides further insights into the reasons respondents gave for their intention or lack thereof to buy a 3d printing unit. these reasons are categorized as follows: 1. **too expensive (33%):** highlighted in the bar graph, this is the predominant reason expressed regarding the expense of purchasing a 3d printing unit. 2. **i dont need it (28%):** significant, indicating respondents do not see immediate necessity. 3. **not interested (7%):** slightly fewer respondents are not interested in 3d printing technology. 4. **im retiring (5%):** a few respondents cited retirement as a reason. 5. **i prefer the traditional method (3%):** this suggests older or traditional methods are still more acceptable to some respondents. 6. **low demand (2%):** indicates the lack of current or projected demand. 7. **poor familiarity with the technology (2%):** a small group might find 3d technology unfamiliar, hence reluctant to invest. 8. **poor system precision (2%):** concerns over technical expertise or reliability of the equipment. 9. **i have other priorities (1%):** a minor proportion with other priorities. 10. **other (4%):** miscellaneous reasons not detailed above, totaling 49% of the respondents with reasons cited beyond the listed categories. 11. **dont know / no answer (12%):** some respondents either didnt know or didnt provide an answer. *footer information:** the footer contains logos of two companies, \"omnision digital\" and \"key-stone,\" which might be associated with the survey or the company performing the research. the base numbers for this data are indicated as \"279 cases\" and \"223 cases,\" respectively, suggesting the broader survey sample from which these statistics were drawn. *additional observations:** the emphasis on the price as a deterring factor is crucial (33%). the largest portion (56%, combining the \"too expensive\" and \"i dont need it\") suggests that financial considerations and perceived necessity are the primary barriers to adoption. the diversity in reasons given (including traditional methods and demand) further underscores the varied perceptions regarding 3d printing adoption. ### conclusion: overall, the infographic and pie chart visually represent the majority's reluctance to purchase a 3d printing unit, primarily due to cost and perceived need, with a smaller fraction expressing intention soon. this data highlights the significant challenges that need to be addressed to enhance the adoption rates of 3d technology. *the image contains a bar chart detailing various reasons why non-owner respondents would not be willing to purchase a 3d printing unit within two years.** the bar chart is structured with reasons listed vertically on the left side, and corresponding percentages are represented by horizontal bars filled with a shade of purple, indicating the proportion of respondents who have those reasons for not considering a 3d printing unit purchase. some of the reasons mentioned include: 1. **too expensive:** this is the most prevalent reason, with 33% of respondents stating this as the main barrier. 2. **i dont need it:** the second most frequently cited reason, at 28%. 3. **not interested:** with 7% of respondents, this reason falls further down. 4. **im retiring:** about 5% of respondents cited this as their reason. 5. **i prefer the traditional method:** 3% of respondents indicated a preference for conventional methods over 3d printing. 6. **low demand:** and another 2% cited low demand for their products or services as reasons. apart from the main categories, there are several other minor reasons mentioned, with each represented by the smallest bars: **poor familiarity with technology:** 2% of respondents indicated this as a reason. **poor system precision:** this too accounted for 2% of the responses. **i have other priorities:** this is the least cited primary reason with 1% of respondents. **other:** filling categories that don't fit the other reasons, this accounts for 4% of the responses. **dont know / no answer:** a segment with 12% of respondents were either unsure or didn't provide an answer to the question. this chart is visually segmented into different colored bars, making it easy to distinguish between these various reasons and compare their significance at a glance. the content and structure of the first image are highly detailed, providing additional context for the reasons discussed in this image. it highlights the primary reasons from high to low and also includes a pie chart which visually reinforces the percentage of respondents for some of the main answers.", "type": "Document"}}
