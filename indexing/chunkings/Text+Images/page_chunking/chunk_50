center part of a larger image that appears to contain additional information framed with an accompanying title and text providing context to the pie chart. the pie chart represents a split of data into two segments: a large dark blue segment, which occupies the majority of the pie chart, shows \"74%\". a smaller light blue segment, representing a contrasting percentage, shows \"26%\". there are no additional annotations, labels, or legends provided within the pie chart itself. the surrounding context, however, provides further insight into the data represented here. from the larger image, you can see references to specific scenarios in a medical context (e.g., patients undergoing laboratory tests, the average number of proteins tested) and mention of external collaborations. this indicates that the pie chart likely represents the distribution of such data in this specific clinical scenario. given the context provided in the larger frame with additional text and possibly other linked imagery and data points, this pie chart would sit within a larger study or report detailing a critical aspect of laboratory operations in clinical settings. the percentages denote the relative proportions of the data segments which could be related to patient outcomes, laboratory protocols, or resource allocation. the image, therefore, is significant within a comprehensive informational or statistical report likely aiming to convey key findings or operational insights. the detailed nature of the larger context suggests it is not merely a standalone statistic but rather an ingredient of a larger narrative examining clinical lab operations in more depth. the image contains a pie chart that visually represents the results of a survey focused on the number of healthcare professionals employed in dental clinics. this pie chart appears within the second larger image, where it is embedded in a contextual infographic that illustrates several important data points relevant to dental professionals in year starting with the pie chart itself, it is divided into four segments, each representing a different set of data: the largest segment, taking up 43%, signifies that 43% of dental clinics have only one dental professional as part of their team. the second-largest segment, comprising 36%, indicates a workplace with two dental professionals. a smaller segment at 19% represents clinics where dental professionals work with three or more colleagues. the smallest segment, which accounts for 2%, signifies clinics where no dental professionals are employed or the number of professionals is unknown. around the pie chart, there's supporting information in red text: \u201cen caso afirmativo, \u00bfcu\u00e1ntos?\u201d with the phrase \"media: 1,5 dental proses\" under a scale showing 1 through 2 or more, indicating the average number of professionals per clinic. \u201cen caso negativo, \u00bfcon cu\u00e1ntos laboratorios colabora?\u201d with the phrase \"media: 2,5 laboratrios externo\u201d including a note indicating the average number of extra laboratories. this text shows a comparison between years 2015 and 2014 as also noted. there is another text block at the top pointing to the pie chart: \u201cen caso afirmativo, \u00bfcu\u00e1ntos?\u201d followed by the phrase \u201c74%\u201d, \"22 cases\" and \"26%\" with corresponding notes \u201c1\u201d and \"2 or more\", indicating the number of professionals in affirmative cases, their distribution, and the number corresponding to the affirmative responses. additionally, there is a section on the left side that informs: \u201cel porcentaje de dentistas trabajando con dental proses en la clinica se ha incrementada (3% de las clinicas declara al menos un dental profe en 2015).\u201d translated it means \u201cthe percentage of dentists working with dental professionals in clinics has increased (3% of clinics declare at least one dental professional in 2015).\u201d the base, \"omnivision digital\", indicates the data source for the pie chart and gives context to the specific data set being 282 cases representing all surveyed cases. all these elements collectively offer insights into the professional distribution within dental clinics as of 2015, emphasizing the growth and averages of dental professionals within clinic setups. the image contains a simplified visual representation of a \u201cvenn diagram\u201d showing the relationship between different groups of dental professionals who practice in offices. this specific diagram is labeled with two distinct categories, which likely represent different scenarios or classifications within clinical practices, as seen in the first image in the context. at the top of the image, there are legends indicating different numerical values: a blue square and circle indicate the number \u201c2\u201d. a smaller dark blue circle in the center indicates the number \u201c1\u201d. a larger light blue circle surrounding the smaller ones indicates the number \u201c3 or more\u201d. a gray box without a label likely indicates \u201cdon't know / no answer\u201d. these categorical classifications visually map out the proportions of these groupings, suggesting how many dental professionals fall between specific thresholds (1, 2, 3, or more). here's a breakdown of the visual content: 1. **blue circle and square \u201c2\u201d:** represented by a single blue circle and square, these likely indicate medical professionals who follow a specific set of protocols with 2 labs. 2. **dark blue circle \u201c1\u201d:** a smaller dark blue circle, usually at the center, denoting professionals with 1 lab. 3. **light blue circle \u201c3 or more\u201d:** the largest light blue circle encompassing the others, suggesting professionals following 3 or more labs. 4. **gray box \u201cdon\u2019t know / no answer\u201d:** representing the data where the patient doesn\u2019t have an answer. this gray box does not align with specific numerical thresholds and might represent those who cannot specify lab protocols. this second image, in combination with the accompanying text data from the first image, analyzes the lab practices in dental clinics, breaking down the prevalence of single-provider systems versus those relying on multiple professionals and labs, indicating shifts or trends in collaborative practices within healthcare systems in the context provided. the image contains a pie chart that represents the data related to whether dentists in clinics work with internal protection/analysis laboratories or cooperates with an external laboratory in the chart is divided into two sections, with the outer ring representing 'yes' (indicating that dentists work with an internal lab) and the inner ring representing 'no, we cooperate with an external laboratory.' the blue section at the top of the chart occupies 10% of the total pie, marked as \"no, we cooperate with an external laboratory.\" this smaller section is labeled with \"10%\" to indicate the percentage of dentists who work without an internal lab, and further categorizes this with \"2,5 laboratorios externos.\" the larger section below this blue section represents the majority of the dentists who work with an internal lab, occupying 90% of the total pie. it is labeled as \"yes,\" indicating that the dentists complete their protection/analysis internally. within this section, \"74%\" signifies the majority of these dentists, while \"26%\" is indicative of dentists who work with an internal lab but may also use external resources sometimes in case of confirmation. additionally, this image is part of a larger context presented in the accompanying text and other graphics. to the right is a smaller pie chart showing the distribution of clinicians working in dental clinics in 2015, further detailing the proportions of dentists who use internal versus external labs for their work in protection/ analysis.", "type":
