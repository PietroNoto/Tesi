30 menciones 102 clinic the image contains a pie chart illustrating survey responses related to user satisfaction across different cad-cam brands (cad-cam). the pie chart is a part of a larger page that presents results from a study conducted by omnivision and key-stone (as seen on the lower part of the page). the chart is divided into three distinct segments, each representing a different level of satisfaction rating out of a possible range from 1 to 10: 1. **no satisfecho** (yellow segment): this segment represents 37% of the responses, indicating that 37% of users rate their satisfaction as \"not satisfied.\" 2. **bastante satisfecho** (blue segment): the second segment accounts for 23% of the responses, indicating that 23% of users rate their satisfaction as \"somewhat satisfied.\" 3. **muy satisfecho** (orange segment): the largest segment occupies 40% of the responses, suggesting that 40% of users rate their satisfaction as \"very satisfied.\" the surrounding text indicates that the survey questions the cad-cam systems' performance and their satisfaction towards the brands they are using, with each brand providing a response using a 1-10 scale from the 10 possible responses. the results are aggregated post-hoc, showing different thresholds for different satisfaction levels. the overall message conveyed is that a significant portion of users rate their satisfaction as high, while a smaller percentage indicates dissatisfaction. there is also a smaller pie chart at the top right corner, labeled \"2015 media,\" indicating the median sentiment value across similar previous years. in contrast to the main chart, this one shows only one segment with the label \"7,7,\" signifying that the median satisfaction rating in 2015 was 7.7 out of 10, which suggests a slightly higher satisfaction rate overall compared to the responses displayed in the main chart. the image contains a pie chart which is a visual representation of data distribution concerning users' satisfaction with their cad-cam marketing. this visualization specifically displays the proportion of satisfaction levels indicated by each of the 10 possible responses, categorized into three main groups: 1. **no satisfecho (not satisfied)**: 37% 2. **bastante satisfecho (somewhat satisfied)**: 40% 3. **muy satisfecho (very satisfied)**: 23% to elaborate, the chart demonstrates a breakdown of global satisfaction among users who employ cad-cam systems, with particular reference to the punctuations in their satisfaction level measured from 1 to the largest segment, occupying 71% of the chart, represents the largest group of users who fall into the \"not satisfied\" category. the next considerable segment, making up 40% of the chart, features users that are \"somewhat satisfied\" while the remaining 23% represents users who are \"very satisfied.\" the purpose of the figure is to provide a stark visual conclusion of the user satisfaction analysis across users utilizing cad-cam technology. noteworthy is the observation that a significant majority of users, 71%, were not satisfied with their experience or satisfaction level, indicating a concerning trend that might suggest a need for improvements in cad-cam marketing strategies or the technology itself. this critical observation is further emphasized by a comparison with the 2015 edition where \"not satisfied\" responses had a slightly lower percentage, reinforcing the increased dissatisfaction observed in the current data.", "type": "Document"}}
