95%; 88% - 2 chairs: 88%; 95%; 98% - 3 or more chairs: 88%; 88%; 88% 2. **social class of patients:** - each subsequent column represents the \"social class of patients.\" - they include \"d (middle)\", \"c/d (middle high class)\", \"middle class\", \"(a/b) class\", and lower class. - the percentages for each class across all groups are as follows: - d class (middle): 88%, 95%, 89% - c/d class (middle high class): 97%, 98%, 97% - middle class: 98%, 98%, 98% - (a/b) class: 100%, 100%, 100% - lower class: 88%, 88%, 88% *bars:** the bars for \"owners (scanner only)\" are usually the tops of each column, making it notable that in most categories, this group consistently represents the top offer percentage. \"owners chairside\" falls right behind them and usually shows a slightly lower but still considerable percentage. the \"not owner and send the models to a provider\" shows the lowest percentage but is relevant in each category. *pie chart (left of graphs):** a pie chart divides \"owners\" by whether they are chairside providers or not, breaking it down into 94% (without chairside) and 5% (with chairside). an intriguing piece of information from this pie chart is that owners who provide chairside service are fewer (5% compared to a substantial 94% who do not use a chairside service). *footer note:** the note, \"considering that only 42% of the sample offers cad-cam prostheses and that 4.7% of these offers include a chairside, it is calculated that there is less than 2% of cad-cam in brazil.\" base information: 239 cases *brand and source:** at the bottom right of the chart, \"key-stone\" is mentioned, likely indicating the source or brand associated with the survey or the publication of the data. this detailed breakdown of the chart reveals how the offerings of cad-cam prostheses are distributed across various group classifications by dental practitioners in brazil. it captures their reliance on ownership, capacity, and patient social status. the image contains two sets of bar graphs accompanied by accompanying texts. one graph displays detailed metrics related to the ownership and usage of cad-cam prostheses by a sample group of 239 cases, and the second bar graph shows demographic data specific to patients who use the cad-cam prostheses. the first bar graph, located on the left side of the page, features a pie chart at the top with three segments. it labels: **94% owners (scanner only)** **5% owners chairside (scanner and milling unit)** **1% not owner and send the models to a provider** below the pie chart, a cluster of seven bars (one for each category) provides specific percentage values: **owners (scanner only)**: 98%, 9%, 5%, 9% (from left to right) **owners chairside (scanner and milling unit)**: 95%, 9% (from left to right) **not owner and send the models to a provider**: 88%, 88% (from left to right) the accompanying text elaborates that only 42% of the sample offers cad-cam prostheses, with only 4.7% offering both the scanner and milling unit, indicating that less than 2% of cad-cam uses are in brazil. the second bar graph on the right side of the page illustrates the correlation between the number of patients serviced per week and the monthly expenditure on consumable materials per dollar spent. the key categories on the horizontal x-axis from left to right are: **number of patients per week**: up to 30, from 31 to 60, more than the key categories on the vertical y-axis (which appears in two parts) are: **monthly expenditure on consumable materials**: per 1 dollar, per $12 (separated into different percentage segments for $1 & $12). every category has blue bars representing different percentages. for details: for `up to 30` patients per week, the bars show percentages of `98%` and `2%` for monthly expenditures of $1 and $12 respectively. for `from 31 to 60` patients per week, the values are `95%` and `2%` for $1, and `5%` and `4%` for $ for `more than 60` patients per week, the figures are `88%` and `5%` for $1, and `12%` and `5%` for $ the data emphasize the higher correlation with the number of patients served, as represented by the length of the bars, especially visible in the cost associated per $ the bottom of both graphs notes that the base sample size used is 239 cases under the label \"cad-cam users,\" with these being a random sample.", "type": "Document"}}
