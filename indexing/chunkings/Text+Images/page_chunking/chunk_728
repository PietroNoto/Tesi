the image contains a simplified bar graph comparing the adoption of digital scanning equipment (scanners) and milling units in digital technologies owners between the years 2015 and 2018. *details of the graph for scanners:** the vertical axis represents different percentages of digital technology owners using the equipment. in 2015, 68% of owners had a scanner, as shown by the blue portion, while 32% did not have one, represented in the purple portion. by 2018, the adoption increased to 54% of owners having a scanner, indicated by the blue portion, with only 46% without, shown by the purple portion. *details of the graph for milling units:** the same vertical axis applies, showing the percentage of owners using the equipment. in 2015, 87% of owners had a milling unit, indicated by the blue portion, while 13% did not have one, represented in the purple portion. by 2018, the percentage who had a milling unit decreased to 82%, while the percentage without a milling unit increased to 18%. *comparative analysis:** the percentage of owners using a scanning equipment showed an 8% increase (from 68% to 54%) from 2015 to conversely, the percentage of owners using a milling unit decreased by 5% (from 87% to 82%). the owners who do not own a scanner increased by 22% (from 32% to 46%). the owners who do not own a milling unit increased by 5% (from 13% to 18%) during the same period. *additional information:** at the top of the image, it reads \"digital technologies owners\" followed by the question, \"do you have the following equipment in your practice?\" the entire sample consisted of 600 cases. the analysis note at the bottom states: \"the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant.\" the second image, a simplified form of part of the first image, contains specific details focusing on the statistical increase of the number of in-house milling units and a significant increase of scanner users over the years. the numbers and percentages are simplified to emphasize key insights: in 2015, 87% had a milling unit, with 13% without. by 2018, this reduced to 82%, with 18% without. this image effectively highlights the trends and changes in the adoption of essential digital technology tools within digital technologies owners over a three-year period. the image contains a bar graph depicting ownership statistics of a specific type of equipment among digital technology owners for two years, 2015 and it is part of a larger infographic discussing digital technology adoption trends related to owners of industrial and home milling units. in the first bar graph, titled \"scanner to take digital impressions,\" data is presented for both 2015 and the years are listed on the bottom axis, and the responses \"yes\" are indicated by dark blue bars, while \"no\" responses are shown in light blue. the \"yes\" responses for 2015 are broken down as follows: in 2015, 68% of respondents answered \"yes.\" in 2018, the \"yes\" response dropped to 54%. for \"no,\" the dark bars represent: 32% in 2015. 46% in a comparison note at the bottom of the graph states that the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. the second bar graph, titled \"milling unit,\" shows ownership data for the same years: in 2015, 87% of respondents answered \"yes.\" in 2018, the \"yes\" response slightly decreased to 82%. for \"no,\" the corresponding percentages are: 13% in 2015. 18% in the graph highlights a notable increase in the number of in-house milling units and a +14% increase in scanner users between 2015 and the data is sourced from 600 cases considered as the entire sample, as indicated in the bottom left of the graphs. the source of the data sets is marked by two logos, \"omnivision\" and \"key-stone\" at the bottom left. some infographic elements include the logos of \"dl\" and \"labo\" at the top right. together, these graphs demonstrate trends in digital technology adoption, focusing on the uptake of scanners for digital impressions and milling units in the industrial sector from 2015 to 2018.", "type": "Document"}}
