you, to improve and enhance the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your laboratory? 25 dental practices laboratories clinic + labo the image contains two horizontal bar graphs side by side, each displaying the percentage of dental practice laboratories' requirements from digital technology providers over two different years, 2015 and the graphs represent three different categories categorized into \"dental practices\" and \"laboratories\". ### for dental practices: 1. **price convenience (2018) | 27%**: a long horizontal bar indicating that in 2018, 27% of dental practices valued convenience in pricing from digital technology providers. 2. **training, information, demonstrations (2018) | 36%**: represented by a slightly shorter bar, this shows 36% emphasizing the importance of training and informational resources in 2018. 3. **improve performances (2018) | 16%**: shorter bar showing 16% of dental practices sought to improve their performance using new technologies in 2018. 4. **increase/strengthen relationship (2018) | 14%**: another shorter bar indicating 14% intended to use digital technologies to strengthen their business relationships. 5. **other (2018) | 8%**: this smaller bar represents the 8% of respondents who had other specific needs. 6. **nothing/not interested (2018) | 10%**: a minor bar showing that 10% did not require anything or were not interested in these technologies. ### for laboratories: 1. **training and information (2018) | 48%**: a long horizontal bar signifying that 48% of dental laboratory professionals prioritized training and information in 2018. 2. **price convenience (2018) | 32%**: showing 32%, this bar indicates a significant preference for convenient and affordable pricing by lab professionals in 2018. 3. **improve performances (2018) | 14%**: a shortish bar showing that 14% aimed at improving performance via digital technology. 4. **customer service (2018) | 11%**: represented by a relatively small bar, this indicates 11% valued customer service provided by digital tech in 2018. 5. **other (2018) | 1%**: almost negligible, with 1% having other unique requirements. 6. **not interested (2018) | 26%**: the longest bar indicates that by 2018, a notable 26% of laboratory professionals did not see any value in digital technologies for their needs. ### comparative analysis: **dental practices**: there is a clear focus on training and information for both years, indicating a consistent importance in providing users with updated and comprehensive educational resources. significant changes are seen in the percentage of those interested in price convenience, showing a stronger focus on affordability and ease of use in 2018. **laboratories**: a substantial increase is seen in those requiring training and information (48% in 2018 compared to 25% in 2015), indicating a more significant shift towards valuing educational resources. the lack of interest among lab professionals almost doubled from 14% in 2015 to 26% in 2018, possibly reflecting skepticism or a higher degree of self-sufficiency in the lab sector. the overall pattern and trends identified from these data highlight a significant rise in the perceived value of training and affordability in 2018 compared to 2015, likely driven by advancements and enhanced digital offerings. the image contains a horizontal bar graph comparing the most required features from digital technology providers by dental practitioners and laboratories in three different categories: \"dental practices,\" \"laboratories,\" and a combined category titled \"clinic + labo.\" for \"dental practices,\" the features in descending order of importance are: 1. **price convenience**: 42% (represented by a dark brown bar) 2. **training, information, demonstrations**: 36% (represented by a yellowish bar) 3. **improve performances**: 12% (represented by a pinkish bar) 4. **increase/strengthen the relationship**: 3% (represented by even more of a pinkish bar) 5. **other**: 1% 6. **nothing / not interested**: 8% for \"laboratories,\" the features in descending order of importance are: 1. **training and information**: 48% (represented by another yellowish bar) 2. **price convenience**: 32% (represented by a dark brown bar, similar in shade to the first category's 'price convenience') 3. **improve performances**: 14% (also with a pinkish bar, in similar shade as in the first category) 4. **customer service**: 11% (a dark yellow bar) 5. **other**: 1% 6. **nothing / not interested**: 26% (a grey bar, significantly larger than the corresponding bar for both dental practices and laboratories) for \"clinic + labo\" (which appears to include both dental practices and laboratories): 1. **price convenience**: 42% (dark brown, same as for dental practices) 2. **training, information, demonstrations**: 36% (yellowish, identical to dental practices) 3. **improve performances**: 12% (pinkish, same as for dental practices) 4. **increase/strengthen the relationship**: 3% (pinkish, consistent across all three categories) 5. **other**: 1% 6. **nothing / not interested**: 10% (grey, the same as for both dental practices and laboratories) the visual elements consist of alternating colors for each category and feature, making the data easily distinguishable. each category has the same features listed, but their relative importance varies. some notable observations include: **price convenience** is consistently a top priority, especially for dental practices. **training, information, demonstrations** is equally important for both clinical settings. **nothing / not interested** shows higher percentages for laboratories with 26%, contrasted against 14% for dental practices and 10% for the combined category. the image contains a bar chart illustrating the required features from digital technology providers for clinics and laboratories. the chart is divided into two categories, \"dental practices\" and \"laboratories,\" each featuring multiple features along with corresponding percentages indicating interest. for \"dental practices,\" the following features and their respective 2018 percentages are listed: 1. **price convenience**: 42% 2. **training and information**: 36% 3. **improve performances**: 16% 4. **increase/strengthen the relationship**: 14% 5. **other**: 8% 6. **nothing / not interested**: 10% 7. **not interested**: 14% for \"laboratories,\" the listed features and their 2018 percentages are: 1. **training and information**: 48% 2. **price convenience**: 32% 3. **improve performances**: 14% 4. **customer service**: 11% 5. **other**: 1% 6. **not interested**: 23% 7. **not interested**: 26% the chart uses a color-coded scheme where the brown segments represent the year 2018, and the yellow segments represent the year the gray box labeled \"not interested\" indicates the number of respondents who were not interested in utilizing digital technology providers. additionally, a note on the right side of the page from omnivision and another keystone logo indicates the source or associated companies related to the data
