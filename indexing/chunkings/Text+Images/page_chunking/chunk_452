in-house milling: 62% blue bars, 38% red bars - scanning: 62% blue bars, 36% red bars - full outsourcing: 56% blue bars, 43% red bars - partner-lab: 63% blue bars, 37% red bars - manufacturer: 59% blue bars, 39% red bars the bar chart effectively demonstrates varying levels of acceptance and skepticism toward digital technologies replacing traditional prosthesis across different roles and channels. ### base: the base of the pie charts mentions the total sample size as 588 cases, ensuring the interpretation of percentages is tied back to a broad dataset. ### conclusion: the second image, focusing on text interpretation, reiterates the findings that digital technologies will likely replace most of the traditional prosthesis, although there remains a significant portion of users who still see the relevance of traditional methods. the responses are segmented according to different restoration provider roles, highlighting that these individuals hold varied views on the impact of digital technologies. through this detailed description, we can infer that these data visualizations collectively highlight concerns and expectations regarding the adoption of digital technologies in the prosthesis industry, showcasing a nuanced perspective of both technological advancements and traditional practices. the image contains a pie chart with four segments representing different percentages. it has a base color of light blue and two distinct colors for the segments: a darker blue and black. the largest segment, colored in dark blue, accounts for 55% of the pie. the second-largest segment, also in dark blue, accounts for 42% of the pie. the third segment, represented in black, is the smallest, making up 3% of the pie. there is no segment in the remaining blue section, occupying 0%. this pie chart is contained within the context of a printed page, which shows additional textual information and graphical elements. the pie chart sits at the center-right portion of the page, with several data points and graphical representations surrounding it. the image contains a pie chart titled \"role of digital technologies on prosthetics in the future\" and it represents a specific statistic about users' perceptions on how digital technologies (cad-cam and 3d printing) are likely to affect the way prosthetics are carried out. here's a detailed description: the pie chart is divided into three segments: 1. **largest segment (blue): 50%** - this segment is labeled with the number 50% and is colored in a light blue shade. - this segment represents the percentage of users who think that digital technologies will not play an important role in the context of how prosthetics are carried out. 2. **middle segment (blue): 45%** - this segment is similarly light blue but slightly darker than the largest segment and is marked with the number 45%. - this portion corresponds to users who believe that digital technologies will play an important role in the future of prosthetics but maintain that traditional methods will continue to be relevant. 3. **smallest segment (dark blue): 5%** - the smallest segment is in a dark blue shade and represents the percentage, 5%, of users who think digital technologies will completely replace traditional methods in prosthetics. - the label \"no\" adjacent to this segment indicates that traditional prosthetics will remain relevant even with the advent of digital technologies. this pie chart visually encapsulates the distribution of opinions from the broader data set provided in the context of the first image. the image contains a bar graph depicting respondents' opinions on how digital technologies will affect the way prosthetics are carried out. the graph is split into three segments: digital restorations provider, technology, and channel. each segment includes a series of bars representing different categories: yes (62%), no (36%), in-house milling (62%), scanning (36%), full outsource (43%), partner lab (37%), and manufacturer (39%). each bar is colored in two shades of blue, showing the percentage of respondents who either believe digital technologies will replace the traditional prosthetics most significantly (dark blue) or those who feel that traditional prosthetics will continue to be relevant despite the advancements (light blue). additionally, there are small rectangles within some bars indicating percentages such as 5% in the \"full outsource\" bar under \"digital restorations provider\" and 6% in the \"no\" bar under \"channel.\" the data is presented for comparison between various sectors in the prosthetics industry for the year 2015, showcasing the views on how cad-cam and 3d printing technologies are perceived to impact different aspects of prosthetic production.", "type": "Document"}}
