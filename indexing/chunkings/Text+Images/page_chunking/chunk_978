the bar for this category is titled \"sirona\" and has a value of 7.7 for satisfaction, 6.3 for perceived value, 7.6 for advocacy, and 8.2 for repurchase intention. base: 16 cases - the bar for this category is titled \"kavo\" and has values of 7.1 for satisfaction, 6.4 for perceived value, 7.7 for advocacy, and 7.3 for repurchase intention. base: 15 cases - the bar in this category is titled \"3m\" and has values of 6.5 for satisfaction, 6.4 for perceived value, 7.0 for advocacy, and 7.3 for repurchase intention. base: 37 cases - the bar in this category is labeled \"others\" and has values of 6.9 for satisfaction, 6.0 for perceived value, 6.9 for advocacy, and 7.2 for repurchase intention. each value for each category is presented with a corresponding bar that's colored in a pinkish tone. the overall page displays these loyalty metrics in an organized format with a focus on comparison. the metrics for each base category are presented distinctly and are easily interpretable to the viewer, providing a clear visual representation for comparative analysis. the image contains a vertical bar chart with four grouped bar representations, each comparing different loyalty metrics across two groups. the chart is labeled \"loyalty metrics compared,\" with the title stating, \"satisfaction, perceived value, advocacy, repurchase intention.\" from left to right, the metrics are categorized into two groups: 1. **satisfaction**: - the first group (54 cases) has a blue bar representing the satisfaction metric at 7.7. - the second group (16 cases) has a red bar at 7.1, slightly lower than the first group. 2. **perceived value**: - the first group shows a red bar, indicating a perceived value of 6.3. - the second group, with 15 cases, is blue and shows a slightly lower value at 6.5. 3. **advocacy**: - the first group, blue bar, represents 7.6. - the second group, red, shows a slightly higher value at 7.7. 4. **repurchase intention**: - the first group, with a blue bar, indicates an intention value of 8.2, the highest across all metrics. - the second group has a purple bar showing a value of 7. next to the bar chart, there are four separate bar representations aligned horizontally, each corresponding to the vertical bar chart's respective metrics: **satisfaction**: - for the first group: 7.7 - for the second group: 7.1 **perceived value**: - for the first group: 6.3 - for the second group: 6.5 **advocacy**: - for the first group: 7.6 - for the second group: 7.7 **repurchase intention**: - for the first group: 8.2 - for the second group: 7. the bars are all a light green color across all metrics. at the bottom-right corner of the whole page, the omnivision digital logo with an associated symbol is placed next to the title, and a key-stone logo without a corresponding symbol is placed adjacent to the chart. the chart includes a legend symbol on the top left corner and an option to \"focus on mean\" via a red button at the top right corner. the scales for all metrics are from a minimum of 6.0 to a maximum of 8. the overall layout is clean, using a mix of bold blue and pink colors for text and line graphs, ensuring visual clarity and distinctiveness between the different groups and loyalty metrics represented. the image contains a horizontal bar chart that visualizes data regarding 'repurchase intent'. the chart consists of five horizontal bars with different lengths, each representing a different group labeled as 'others', '3m', 'kavo', 'sirona', and 'kavo' again, each with a base sample size indicated above each group label (15, 16, 54, and 37 cases respectively). from the chart, the following observation can be made about the specific 'repurchase intent' score for each group: the 'others' group has a 'repurchase intent' score of 7. the '3m' group has a 'repurchase intent' score of 7. the 'kavo' group, which is noted as both a separate group and repeated with a different sample size (16 cases), has a 'repurchase intent' score of 7. the 'sirona' group has a 'repurchase intent' score of 8. the bar lengths visually represent the different repurchase intent scores, and the color of each bar appears to be in varying shades of purple for distinctiveness. below the chart, aligned with each group label are the respective bar colors. each score is quantified and serves as a measure of how likely or willing the respective group is likely to repurchase the product or service, with higher values indicating stronger repurchase intent.", "type": "Document"}}
