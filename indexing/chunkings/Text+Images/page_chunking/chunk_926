**76%** in a solid blue section, indicating a vast majority of respondents who manage cad-design tasks in their own company. - **19%** in an overlapping grey section labeled \"no, we leave it to the partner laboratory/milling center,\" implying a smaller segment of individuals who outsource cad-design tasks. 3. **legend**: to the left of the pie chart, there is a corresponding legend in blue and grey which explains the color coding for the chart. 4. **source information**: just above the pie chart, the base numbering is mentioned: \"base: 252 cases (scanner owners) indicating the total number of responses considered in this subset analysis. the image serves as a specific visual representation for one aspect of the data collected in the first image, providing a clear and concise breakdown of how respondents manage their cad-design needs. the second image displays a list of options corresponding to the categories depicted in the pie charts in the first image, which are described as part of a survey about cad-design software licensing costs. the image is a legend detailing the various responses to the question about how much is spent on cad design software licenses per year: **no cost**: this section is represented by a dark blue color and indicates that 41% of respondents do not spend any money on cad design software licenses annually. **up to 500**: represented by a slightly lighter blue shade, this responses account for 23% of the surveyed group. **from 501 to 1000**: this group is depicted by a lighter blue shade, showing 16% of respondents fall into this spending range. **more than 1000**: represented by the lightest blue color, it accounts for 7% of the respondents. **dont know / no answer**: this is indicated by a very light gray color, covering 13% of responses. the title on the left reads: \"how much do you spend on cad-design software licenses per year?\" with the base sample of 252 cases from scanning owners represented in the pie chart (the first chart in the first image). overall, the image conveys that a significant proportion, 57%, of scanning owners spend up to 500 annually on cad design software, while a substantial fraction dont incur any cost, denoting a common practice of using freely available or free software for cad design in this demographic. the image contains three pie charts situated side-by-side within the context of a larger survey or report. each pie chart represents data from a different survey question, presenting statistics related to digital cad (computer-aided design) software usage and preferences. ### first pie chart: *survey question:** \"do you / your team take care of digital cad-design or is it a task you leave to the partner laboratory/milling center?\" **response categories:** - yes, we do it ourselves - no, we leave it to the partner laboratory/milling center - don't know / no answer *data:** **76%** of the survey respondents (252 cases within the sample, most likely scanner or software owners) answered \"yes, we do it ourselves.\" **19%** said \"no, we leave it to the partner laboratory/milling center.\" **5%** indicated they \"don't know / no answer.\" ### second pie chart: *survey question:** \"how much do you spend on cad-design software licenses per year?\" **response categories:** - no cost - up to 500 - from 501 to 1000 - more than 1000 - don't know / no answer *data:** **41%** spent \"no cost.\" **23%** spent \"up to 500 .\" **16%** spent \"from 501 to 1000 .\" **7%** spent \"more than 1000 .\" **13%** didn't answer. ### third pie chart: *survey question:** \"which payment method do you prefer?\" **response categories:** - monthly - yearly - don't know / no answer *data:** **57%** preferred \"monthly.\" **39%** preferred \"yearly.\" **4%** answered \"don't know / no answer.\" by detailing each category's corresponding percentage in the context of their respective survey questions, they illustrate distinct trends and preferences among the sample population regarding cad software usage, software cost, and payment methods. these visual representations allow for a clear visualization of how digital cad design is managed and financially handled within the surveyed group. the image shows a pie chart with three distinct sections, each colored differently to denote different categories of payment intervals for cad-design software licenses. 1. **dark blue section (39%)**: represents individuals or entities who prefer to pay annually for their cad-design software licenses. this is indicated by the label \"yearly\" present on the chart. the dark blue color occupies nearly four out of ten sections of the pie chart, showing a majority preference for annual billing cycles. 2. **larger blue section (57%)**: represents those who prefer to pay monthly for their cad-design software licenses, using the label \"monthly.\" the larger blue section is quite substantial, comprising just under six parts of the total pie chart, indicating that this group is the dominant preference among those surveyed or represented in the data. 3. **small gray section (4%)**: contains the smallest percentage of respondents indicating their payment preference, with the label \"don't know / no answer.\" this section is gray in color, covering only a very small portion of the pie chart, almost less than one additional part. the chart overall implies a strong inclination towards monthly payments (57%), followed by those who go yearly (39%), and a very small segment of respondents who are unsure or have no answer (4%). the source of the data is attributed to 246 cases in the image legend, although it is not clear the exact nature or breakdown of the data points into these categories specifically. additionally, the image is positioned within a larger context given that it appears on a page containing other pie charts from different studies, likely highlighting various preferences in digital cad-design and related fields.", "type": "Document"}}
