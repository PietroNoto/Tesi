relationship between dentists and technicians and the industry will change with the new digital technologies? 27 base: 1000 cases the major part of the quotes are in the direction of a tighter cooperation between dentists and technicians and between dentists and the industry, due to the increasing need for specific manufactured products that the manufacturers can provide. this stance is rather even among countries, with spain showing a higher feeling about the increase in the cooperation between dentists and the industry. the image contains a circular pie chart labeled beneath the text \"de esp\" in the top right corner and \"country\" in the middle. the pie chart's background color is white, and it is divided into five segments, each representing a different percentage of responses to a survey question. the segment colors are blue, dark blue, gray, and two shades of blue that are lighter and darker than the others. starting from the top right segment, the pie chart displays the following segments with their respective percentages: the light blue segment is the largest, taking up 35% of the pie chart. the dark blue segment is the next largest, making up 34%. the gray segment is the smallest, comprising only 7% of the pie chart. the darkest blue segment is 34%, but it is not segmented into two smaller portions by the legend, suggesting that the largest segment (35%) includes other categories not specified. the legend at the bottom explains the data with three primary statements: the relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing. the relationship will become blander because the cad processing will be even easier and it does not require specific expertise from the dentists. the relationship with the industry will become tighter because of the need for case-specific manufactured products and services. the overall chart conveys that, out of the surveyed group, 35% believe the relationship will tighten due to high specialization on specific tasks, 34% think it will tighten because of industry-specific product needs, and 7% think it will become blander due to easier cad processing. the largest portion, representing 35%, falls into the category of tighter relationships, illustrating a significant majority opinion on the matter. the image contains a bar chart titled \"scenario: change in the relationship among dentists, technicians, and industry.\" it illustrates how respondents believe digital technology will affect the relationship among dentists, technicians, and the industry, with data divided by countries. the vertical axis on the left indicates the response categories. three categories are color-coded and listed as follows: a blue rectangle representing \"the relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing,\" labeled as category a. a blue and grey rectangle representing \"the relationship will become blander because the cad processing will be easier and it does not require specific expertise from the dentists,\" labeled as category b. a grey rectangle representing \"don't know,\" labeled as c. on the right side, a legend correlates each color to its respective category: the smallest gray rectangle is 7% the medium blue rectangle is 25% the largest blue rectangle is 36% the medium grey rectangle is 33% a smaller blue rectangle is 9% a medium blue rectangle is 40% a dark blue rectangle is 49% the smallest light blue rectangle is 26% the smallest dark blue rectangle is 12% the smallest blue and grey rectangle is 22% the smallest dark blue rectangle is 6% the smallest light blue rectangle is 34% the smallest blue rectangle is 50% the smallest light blue rectangle is 1% in each country section, these bar segments summarize the percentage of respondents who believe the relationship will tighten or blander (a or b) and those who answered \"don't know.\" specifically, the countries shown, from left to right, are \"de,\" \"fr,\" \"it,\" \"sp,\" and \"uk\": de: 36% tighten, 25% blander, 33% don't know fr: 37% tighten, 26% blander, 27% don't know it: 40% tighten, 49% blander, 12% dont know sp: 49% tighten, 47% blander, 12% dont know uk: 27% tighten, 50% blander, 22% dont know the overall chart aims to convey the impact of digital technologies on professional dynamics within the dental industry, comparing perceptions across different european countries. the image displays a textual enumeration of survey responses, specifically focusing on the expected changes in relationships between dentists, technicians, and the industry in response to the introduction of new digital technologies. the primary question asks: \"how do you think the relationship between dentists and technicians and the industry will change with the new digital technologies?\" below the question, there are four primary categories for responses, each represented by a different colored dot: 1. **blue dot**: indicates respondents who believe the relationship will become tighter primarily due to the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad (computer-aided design) processing. 2. **gray dot**: represents respondents who think the relationship will become blander because cad processing will become even easier and not require specific expertise from dentists. 3. **red dot**: depicts respondents who anticipate the industry relationship will become tighter due to the increased need for specific manufactured products and services. 4. **light blue dot**: represents respondents who chose 'dont know' and left the category blank or did not select this option in favor of the above categories. the corresponding responses from this list appear to be organized by country, though the full context isnt explicitly provided. its likely that each country's data is categorized by place or respondent type, which is a common format for international surveys to allow for comparative analyses. the overall layout is concise and informative, aiming to present the varied responses clearly and quickly while ensuring the data is visually accessible. the inclusion of 'don't know' adds a layer of uncertainty to the analysis, which is valuable for any interpretation of public opinion and industry trends.", "type": "Document"}}
