**utilizamos impresi\u00f3n 3d** (we use 3d printing) - these individuals use 3d printing and most likely utilize it in their daily practice. 2. **light blue bars**: - **lo usamos ocasionalmente en el pasado, pero ya no lo hacemos** (we used it occasionally in the past, but no longer do it) - these individuals occasionally used 3d printing in the past, but it is not a current practice. 3. **purple bars**: - **estoy familiarizado con sus beneficios y usos, pero nunca lo probe** (i am familiar with its benefits and uses, but have never tried it) - these individuals are aware of the benefits and uses of 3d printing, but they have not personally tried it. 4. **gray bars**: - **conozco la impresi\u00f3n en 3d pero no estoy familiarizado con sus beneficios y usos** (i know about 3d printing but am not familiar with its benefits and uses) - while aware of 3d printing, these individuals are not familiar with its advantages or common applications. 5. **sandy beige bars**: - **nunca escuche de eso** (i have never heard of it) - these individuals have not come across or heard of 3d printing. each of these codes helps to classify the responses of clinicians and laboratories in the first image. the image contains a donut chart showing the concordance and usage of 3d imaging in clinical and laboratory settings. it is presented within a larger context of text and infographics. the particular focus here is the donut chart detailing the responses from clinical settings. the donut chart is labeled \"clinicas,\" indicating data from clinic-based responses. it illustrates three key statistics using different shades and colors: 1. **39%** - represented in light blue/blue segment, signifying clinicians who use 3d imaging as a tool. 2. **36%** - shown in dark blue, referring to clinicians who occasionally use or do not use 3d imaging. 3. **12%** - indicated in navy blue/purple for clinicians who are not familiar with 3d imaging. 4. **1%** - the smallest segment, in dark gray, which represents clinicians who do not use 3d imaging and are unlikely to change their stance. the text surrounding the chart and accompanying images emphasize factors influencing the adoption of 3d imaging in medical practice, particularly in clinical and laboratory environments. the overall message is to highlight the varying degrees of familiarity, usage, and adoption rates of 3d imaging among clinicians.", "type": "Document"}}
