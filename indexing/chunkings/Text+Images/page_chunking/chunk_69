about the use of 3d printing by clinic professionals in this pie chart is the second and more detailed version of the information displayed in the accompanying infographic in image- the pie chart in image-2 shows the percentage of clinic professionals surveyed on whether they used a 3d printer or not. according to the pie chart: 86% of the surveyed clinic professionals responded with \"no.\" this indicates that the vast majority of clinics did not utilize 3d printing at that time. 14% responded with \"yes.\" this small percentage represents clinic professionals who utilized 3d printers. the chart is labeled with these percentages: \"yes\" in the blue segment (14%) \"no\" in the larger blue-gray segment (86%) the surrounding context provided by the accompanying text elaborates on this data. it points out that the use of 3d printing increased slightly to 14% in 2015 from the previous year. this change is minimal, with improvements adding only +2% to the total surveyed clinic professionals. additional details from the accompanying text include: 1.1% use 3d printing and is outsourced to a third party. 37% use 3d printing at the clinic. 45% use digital prototyping in-house. these statistics reflect the utilization trends in 3d printing and digital prototyping within clinic settings, showing a continued, albeit slow, inclination towards integrating these technologies. the image contains a bar chart with the title \"usos de impresi\u00f3n 3d por parte de los proveedores de la clinica,\" which in english translates to \"3d printing usage by clinic suppliers.\" this visual data representation is a part of a larger infographic likely from a presentation or a report detailing the adoption and usage of 3d printing technologies. the title of the bar chart is \"usos de impresi\u00f3n 3d (tambi\u00e9n en outsourcing)\" meaning \"uses of 3d printing (also in outsourcing).\" the x-axis of the bar chart is labeled with different categories such as \"regular\" (daily), \"ofrecer\" (offering), and \"proteger\" (protecting), likely to reflect how often different suppliers use 3d printing technologies. the chart shows that some companies are using 3d printing more than others: for \"regular\" usage, the bars indicate a range of usage levels. for \"ofrecer\" (offering), the 3d printing usage is slightly lower. \"proteger\" (protecting) has higher usage frequency than the others. to the right-hand side is a comparison table showing the different categories like users of 3d printing in outsourcing. this might represent: suppliers providing 3d printing services (as listed in red), number of employed people (indicated by an icon), protection in clinics (suggested by the medical cross icon), and providers of digital procedures (potentially represented by other service icons). this image, in conjunction with the other content, suggests that the adoption of 3d printing technologies varies significantly among different suppliers and that their uses\u2014ranging from routine tasks to digital service providers\u2014are significant factors in determining technology uptake within the clinical setting. the image contains a pie chart, which is depicted both isolated and as part of a larger infographic page. it illustrates that 80% of clinics do not use 3d printing for outsourcing. the remaining smaller segments indicate that 8% of clinics use 3d printing occasionally, 6% use it regularly, and 6% have never used it. this pie chart is repeated twice in the infographic, once without annotations and once with annotations that include percentages and additional context, suggesting a longitudinal or comparative presentation regarding the adoption and usage of 3d printing technology in clinic outsourcing. the text around these pie charts indicates significant statistical insights and the usage context of 3d printing within the clinical practice. the image contains a pie chart that visually represents survey results regarding the usage of 3d printing outsourcing by clinical professionals. this pie chart is segmented into two main categories: \"yes\" and \"no.\" *detailed breakdown:** **category \"yes\"**: - this section of the pie chart accounts for 20% of the circle. - the category \"yes\" is colored in blue. **category \"no\"**: - this larger section of the pie chart represents 80% of the circle. - the category \"no\" is colored in a darker shade (likely indicating 'no'). the chart is labeled with the percentage representation of each category inside the colored sections, with \"yes\" occupying the blue section and \u201cno\u201d occupying the larger portion in darker blue. additionally, in the first image that contains the second image, there is a timeline comparison suggesting that by 2015, the percentage who answered \"no\" increased by +2%, and it has not been significant enough to become noteworthy. *survey usage metrics:** users of 3d printing outsourcing provision of patients with personalized implants implementation in clinics the data suggests a significant portion of clinical professionals have indicated not utilizing 3d printing outsourcing as a routine.", "type": "Document"}}
