8% in 2015. **exocad**: 7% in 2018; 3% in 2015. **zirkonzahn**: 7% in 2018; 5% in 2015. **dentsply sirona**: 12% in 2018; 5% in 2015. **roland**: 4% in 2018; 4% in 2015. **ivoclar vivadent**: 6% in 2018; 5% in 2015. **straumann**: 5% in 2018; 4% in 2015. **amann girrbach**: 1% in 2018. **open technologies**: 3% in 2018. **kulzer**: 1% in 2018. **nobel biocare**: 3% in 2018. **formlabs**: 1% in 2018. **imetric**: 2% in 2018. **protechno**: 1% in 2018. **vhf**: 1% in 2018. **3m**: 8% in 2018; 10% in 2015. *top of mind:** the horizontal bar represents the percentage of respondents who mentioned a brand as the first one they think of when considering the purchase of new equipment. the percentages are as follows: **3shape**: 18% in 2018; 8% in 2015. **exocad**: 7% in 2018; 7% in 2015. **zirkonzahn**: 5% in 2018; 5% in 2015. **dentsply sirona**: 12% in 2018; 5% in 2015. **roland**: 4% in 2018; 4% in 2015. **ivoclar vivadent**: 6% in 2018;
