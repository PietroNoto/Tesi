the lightest shade is indicated for the year 2018, signifying that 11% of 3d printers in dental practices were purchased in this year. 2. **2019 segment (27% of the total pie chart)**: - the blue shade indicates a larger segment for 2019, with 27% of the clinics having purchased their 3d printers in this year. this suggests a significant focus in 2019 compared to other years. 3. **2020 segment (30% of the total pie chart)**: - the darkest shade indicates the highest percentage for 2020, with 30% of 3d printers being purchased in the following year. this suggests a surge in adoption in 2020. 4. **2021 segment (15% of the total pie chart)**: - this year has a medium shade, showing that 15% of dental practices have purchased their 3d printers in the year 2021. 5. **up to 2017 segment (16% of the total pie chart)**: - the lightest shade, representing 16%, indicates that a portion of clinics purchased their 3d printers before 2017, which highlights early adopters or sustained interest before the more recent significant surge. the pie chart vividly demonstrates the trend in the year of purchase, showing a pronounced shift towards newer technologies from 2018 to 2020, with significant growth in adoption between 2019 and the image, labeled as page 19 in the publication, features a pie chart related to the question \"do you have a 3d printer in your dental practice?\" the pie chart displays the year of purchase with various colored segments representing different response categories with an average of 2019 indicated in the top right corner. the responses are broken down into five categories, each corresponding with a different color segment: 1. **yes, and we use it often (depicted by a darker blue segment)** 2. **yes, but we rarely use it (depicted by a lighter blue segment)** 3. **no, but we plan to buy it (depicted by an orange segment)** 4. **no, and we dont plan to buy it (depicted by a darker brown segment)** 5. **no, and we dont know if we will buy it (depicted by a tan segment)** the pie chart showcases response distributions across different years, with the latest year (2021) indicated by a lighter color and the earliest (up to 2017) by a darker shade. for each year, a corresponding categorys responses are highlighted: for 2021: - about 16% used the 3d printer frequently. - slightly under 20% rarely used it. - about 20% responded they planned to buy. - nearly 30% indicated they had no plans to buy. - approximately 14% were unsure. for 2020: - just under 27% used it frequently. - 24% rarely used it. - nearly 40% planned to buy. - about 25% had no plans to buy. - about 8% were unsure. for 2019: - approximately 19% used it often. - slightly over 32% rarely used it. - more than 30% planned to buy. - about 20% had no plans to buy. - roughly 9% were unsure. for 2018: - a bit under 22% used it often. - 33% rarely used it. - nearly 55% planned to buy. - about 29% had no plans to buy. - around 12% were unsure. for the earlier years (up to 2017): - just over 15% used it often. - over 35% rarely used it. - nearly 50% planned to buy. - about 24% had no plans to buy. - around 28% were unsure. the overall trend suggests a decrease in the percentage of dental practices using 3d printers frequently from earlier years to more recent ones. there is a noticeable increase in the percentage planning to buy, particularly post-2019, reflecting growing interest in 3d printing technologies in the dental field. meanwhile, the percentage of practices with no current 3d printers and no intention to buy remains consistent across the surveyed years, hovering around 30-40%.", "type": "Document"}}
