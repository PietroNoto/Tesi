green bar: 56% (elements for prostheses on implants) - purple bar: 44% (elements for traditional prostheses) 2. **impressions:** - green bar: 52% (elements for prostheses on implants) - purple bar: 48% (elements for traditional prostheses) 3. **partner-lab:** - green bar: 52% (elements for prostheses on implants) - purple bar: 48% (elements for traditional prostheses) 4. **manufacturer center:** - green bar: 52% (elements for prostheses on implants) - purple bar: 48% (elements for traditional prostheses) 5. **intra-oral scanning:** - green bar: 56% (elements for prostheses on implants) - purple bar: 44% (elements for traditional prostheses) 6. **chairside milling:** - green bar: 54% (elements for prostheses on implants) - purple bar: 46% (elements for traditional prostheses) the chart indicates that a varying percentage of prostheses across these categories are utilized for making implants with digital workflows versus traditional elements. this visual data presentation allows one to assess the extent of adoption of digital workflow technologies in creating implants relative to traditional methods across different sectors involved in prosthetics production and provision. the image contains a pie chart and a legend, illustrating the division of digital production share among different categories in the industry. specifically, the chart segments the distribution based on the type of production: \"elements for prostheses on implants\" (highlighted in green) and \"elements for traditional prostheses\" (highlighted in dark green). the chart indicates that 52% of production elements are for prostheses on implants and the remaining 48% are for traditional prostheses. this chart is a simplified visual representation extracted from a larger infographic, summarizing the findings of a study about digital workflow in the prosthetic industry. the detailed infographic includes additional layers of data and commentary on the specific areas of digital integration, including scans, impressions, partner-lab, manufacturing centers, intraoral scanners, chairside milling units, and digital technology owners, providing deeper insights into the industry's digitization processes.", "type": "Document"}}
