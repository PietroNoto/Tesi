this segment indicates that 35% of the respondents believe the relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians on prosthodontics and cad (computer-aided design) processing. 2. **dark blue sector (34%)** - significantly, 34% of the respondents anticipate that the relationship with the industry will become tighter as a result of the need for manufactured products and services. this suggests a move towards more collaboration and partnership in product development and service provision. 3. **light blue sector (24%)** - 24% of the respondents believe that cad processing will be even easier and it will not require specific expertise from dentists, leading to a more blended and fluid relationship where the lines between dentist, technician, and industry are blurred. 4. **gray sector (7%)** - finally, 7% indicated uncertainty about how the relationships will change, showing that there remains a small but significant proportion of the respondents who are unsure about the direction of these relationships in the era of advanced technologies. each of these segments is distinct and helps in forming a comprehensive overview of the responses. the image further includes two bar graphs that categorize the answers based on different technological domains: \"digit. restor. provider,\" \"prepat. lab,\" \"milling/center,\" \"scanner,\" \"impression,\" and \"chairside milling.\" these categories likely give additional insights into the context of each response, providing structured, segmented data on the nature of the anticipated changes in industry relationships based on the technological domain of concern. the image contains a section titled \"scenario: change in the relationship among dentists, technicians, and industry will change with the new digital technologies?\" it is a data visualization comprising a pie chart on the left and bar graphs on the right. the pie chart has four segments, each depicting the percentage of people who believe different statements regarding the impact of new digital technologies on relationships and industry. these segments are: 1. 34% believe that \"the relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing.\" 2. 24% believe \"the relationship with the industry will become tighter because of the need for case specific manufactured products and services.\" 3. 22% believe that \"the relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing.\" 4. 7% believe that \"the relationship will become blander because the cad processing will be even easier and it does not require specific expertise from the dentists.\" the bar graphs on the right provide detailed breakdowns of the responses further across different categories: 1. \"digit. restoration provider\" 22% 2. \"partner lab\" 6% 3. \"manuf/milling\" 38% 4. \"scanner\" 20% 5. \"impression\" 38% 6. \"chassis milling\" 5% below the bar graphs, there is an explanation that matches the pie chart categories: those marked with dark blue bars are for those who believe the relationship will become tighter. those marked with light blue are for the relationship becoming blander. the responses categorized under the need for industry specialization are marked in gray. in addition to these, the footer of the image contains logos from \"omnivision digital\" and \"key stone\". the base indicates \"base: 1000 cases,\" implying that this data is based on responses from 1000 surveys or cases. the image contains bar charts representing responses to the scenario \"change in the relationship among dentists, technicians, and the industry\" with the introduction of new digital technologies. the bar chart shows the distribution of responses across different categories and tech sectors. these categories and tech sectors include digit. restor. provider, channel, and technology. the responses are categorized into \"no\" (with dark blue bars), \"yes\" (with bright blue bars), \"partner lab\" (with purple bars), \"manuf/milling center\" (with orange bars), \"scanner\" (with green bars), \"impression\" (with dark purple bars), and \"chairside milling\" (with black bars). the percentages indicate the proportion of respondents who believe in each category's impact on the relationship between dentists, technicians, and the industry with digital technologies. for instance, under the \"no\" category for digit. restor. provider, 32% believe that there will be no change, and 25% believe the relationship will become tighter, highlighted in dark blue. these percentages vary across each category and technology group, showing differing levels of expectation and impact perception by the respondents, who are presumably dentists, technicians, and industry members. for example, under technology, \"chairside milling\" has the highest response of 39% indicating that the relationship will become tighter. contrastingly, \"digit. restor. provider\" shows the least response with 32% and \"no\" responses at 35%. the overall structure and distribution of the bar charts suggest a comparative analysis of perceptions regarding the anticipated changes in the dynamic between dentists, technicians, and the industry, based on advancements in digital technologies. each bar segment visually represents the nuanced expectations and varying levels of expertise anticipated across these different segments and technological fields.", "type": "Document"}}
