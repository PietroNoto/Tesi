lab + laboratorio - cl\u00ednicas.\" below the title, the chart is divided into 'laboratorios' and 'cl\u00ednicas' sections. the chart illustrates the percentage change over time from 2015 to 2018 in two distinct regions: laboratories primarily and clinics. ### detail of the bar chart sections: #### laboratorios (laboratories): **year 2015**: - digital technology integration is marked at 45%. - traditional practice paper usage is at 55%. - digital impact on traditional practice paper reduction is at 0%. **year 2018**: - digital technology integration increased to 50%. - traditional practice paper usage decreased to 45%. - digital impact on traditional practice paper reduction increased to 5%. #### clinicas (clinics): **year 2015**: - digital technology integration is at 51%. - traditional practice paper usage stands at 46%. - digital impact on traditional practice paper reduction is marked at 5%. **year 2018**: - digital technology integration is upped to 55%. - traditional practice paper usage fell to 42%. - digital impact on traditional practice paper reduction went up further to 3%. ### interpretation of color and labels: **blue colors**: - light blue represents the percentage of digital technology integration. - medium to dark shades within each bar represent specific digital impacts on traditional practice paper usage, with the dark blue being minimal. **black labels at the bottom**: data points that show specifics for each percentage and year. - the bottom dark blue section in each bar represents the digital contribution to reducing traditional paper usage: 5% in 2015 for laboratories, and 3% in 2018 for clinics. the overall implication of the chart is that while digital technology has made substantial headway in being integrated into daily practice both in laboratories and clinics, its impact on reducing traditional paper usage remains relatively modest across both settings. the specific values indicate that for laboratories, the percentage of digital paper usage actually increased marginally, suggesting either a greater digital adoption that may not be as directly reflected in paper reduction, or perhaps greater initial resource investment in digital infrastructure without immediate reduction in paper output. clinics, however, show a slight increase in digital integration, coupled with a small but consistent reduction in traditional paper usage, indicating a more focused and effective transition towards digital practices. the data illustrates a nuanced dynamic, highlighting the complex interplay between the introduction of digital technologies, the amount of paper used in daily practice, and the progress toward a more digitized healthcare landscape.", "type": "Document"}}
