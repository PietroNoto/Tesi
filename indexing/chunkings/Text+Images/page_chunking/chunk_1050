**3m:** 15% - **dentsply sirona:** 17% - **iovlar:** 6% - **gc:** 42% - **other:** 6% (don't know/no answer) 2. **easy to use:** - **3m:** 11% - **dentsply sirona:** 13% - **iovlar:** 8% - **gc:** 10% - **other:** 5% 3. **flexible/versatile:** - **dentsply sirona:** 16% - **3m:** 14% - **iovlar:** 9% - **gc:** 6% - **other:** 12% 4. **young and modern:** - **3m:** 8% - **dentsply sirona:** 6% - **iovlar:** 12% - **gc:** 8% - **other:** 18% ### observations: **3m and dentsply sirona** stand out in the \"flexible/versatile\" attribute (16% and 14%), as well as \"effective/concrete\" and \"easy to use\" (15% and 13%, respectively). **gc** is particularly seen as effective with a significant 16% in the \"effective/concrete\" category, and has comparable percentages (10% and 8%) in both \"easy to use\" and \"young and modern\" categories. **iovlar** shows up as versatile (9%) and somewhat modern (12%). **other** category reflects a higher percentage in the vague attribute \"other\" (29% - 36%), indicating a large portion unsure or doesn't have a specific response. overall, the chart illustrates the perceived strengths and characteristics of popular dental material brands from the viewpoint of dentists. the image contains a horizontal bar graph titled \"attribute associations\" by brandequity. it displays the results of a survey where respondents were asked to choose which company brand is the closest to each of four attributes: effective/concrete, easy to use, flexible/versatile, and young and modern. the bar graph has four main categories on the x-axis: effective/concrete, easy to use, flexible/versatile, and young and modern. each brand name is listed vertically on the y-axis, and a bar extends horizontally from each brand name to its respective attribute. for the effective/concrete category: dentsply sirona has the highest percentage at 15%. 3m follows at 13%. other percentages are 6%, 5%, 5%, and 4% associated with ivoclar, gc, kerr, and kulzer, respectively. for the easy to use category: dentsply sirona again exhibits the highest percentage at 15%. 3m follows at 11%. other percentages are 8%, 7%, 4%, and 3% associated with ivoclar, gc, kerr, and voco, respectively. for the flexible/versatile category: dentsply sirona leads with 15%. 3m follows at 14%. other percentages include 9%, 5%, and 5% for ivoclar, kulzer, and gc, respectively. for the young and modern category: dentsply sirona has a 9% associate. 3m follows closely at 9%. other percentages range from 5% for gc to 44% for align technology. the bar graph reveals through these proportions how closely each brand is associated with each attribute among the participants in the survey. additionally, a note at the bottom of the graph indicates that the base sample size is 1,018 cases (whole sample). there is notable overlap in associating dentsply sirona with both easy to use and flexible/versatile attributes. lastly, the categories 'other' for all attributes and 'don't know / no answer' each account for 5% and 6%, respectively. the second image is a stacked horizontal bar chart derived from the first page. *content description:** 1. **title:** the bar chart is titled 'attribute associations' from 'key-stone/bradeau.' 2. **main categories and subcategories:** - the main categories at the top are: effective/concrete, easy to use, flexible/versatile, and young and modern. - below these categories, there are different dental companies listed, such as dentsply sirona, 3m, ivoclar, gc (gerstlei chirurgicas), align technology, voco, kulzer, oral b, tokuyama, ultradent, kerr, 3shape, and others. - additionally, there is a category at the bottom labeled 'don't know/no answer' and another category for 'other'. 3. **bar metrics:** - each company is represented by a short horizontal bar extending to the right from the percentage category. - the lengths of these bars indicate the percentage of respondents' associations of each dental company with the mentioned attributes. *details of bars:** **effective/concrete:** - dentsply sirona: 11% - 3m: 9% - ivoclar: 5% - gc: 5% - align technology: 4% - voco, kulzer, oral b, tokuyama, ultradent, kerr: 3% - 3shape: 1% - other: 29% - don't know/no answer: 6% **easy to use:** - dentsply sirona: 11% - 3m: 9% - ivoclar: 5% - gc: 5% - align technology: 4% - voco, kulzer, oral b, tokuyama, ultradent, kerr: 3% - 3shape: 1% - other: 36% - don't know/no answer: 5% **flexible/versatile:** - dentsply sirona: 11% -
