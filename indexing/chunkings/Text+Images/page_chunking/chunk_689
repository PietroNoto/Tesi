digital users only the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. percentage of dental practices - whole sample clinic base: 281 cases (whole sample) the image is a bar graph under the heading \"digital technology: breakdown by channel.\" it analyzes the percentage of dental practices that utilize digital restorations through various channels as part of a survey, specifically showing the \"percentage of dental practices - whole sample\" for the year 2018 relative to the bar graph classifies dental practices into different groups based on how they use these technologies and channels: 1. **chairside milling**: - the usage is 5% in 2018 and 5% in it has a small bar in light green color. 2. **partner-lab**: - shows a notable increase in 2018 to 32%, compared to 60% in 2015, depicted by a tall light purple bar. 3. **manufacturer / milling center**: - shows a slight increase in 2018 at 6%, slightly below the 21% recorded in it is depicted with a small light green bar. 4. **non-users of digital technologies**: this group is significantly more prominent in 2018 at 36%, indicating that a higher percentage of dental practices do not use digital technologies at all, as is also shown to be 5% in this is represented by a dark blue bar. the bars are color-coded with each category having a distinct color for easy differentiation. the graphs percentages are presented in bold on top of each corresponding bar, making it clear to see the relative proportions used in 2018 and at the top of this graph, there are further details about the sample size of 281 cases for the whole sample, and there is a note about the statistical considerations with the margin of error being +/-2%, considered not statistically relevant. the image is positioned centrally on a page from a dental clinic named \"key-stone clinic,\" indicated by logos at the bottom. the overall layout is clean, with a clear distinction between different types of digital technology adoption channels used in different dental practices. the image contains a horizontal bar graph illustrating data about \"percentage of dental practices - whole sample\" and the breakdown of channels for digital technology usage. the graph is divided into three sections, each representing different aspects of digital technology adoption by dental practices. *header information:** the graph is titled \"percentage of dental practices - whole sample.\" it is categorized under the section named \"digital technology use: breakdown by channel\" and is an excerpt from a larger page containing the same data. *left side bar:** the left side is color-coded pink and contains the following data: \"chairside milling\" is represented by a short bar with a 7% label. \"scans sent to manufacturers / milling centers\" are shown with a 91% bar, indicating that a significant portion of scans are sent to manufacturers or milling centers. \"scans sent to other partner labs\" have a 30% bar, and \"impressions sent to other partner labs\" have a 6% bar. *right side bar:** the right side displays the same data in a simplified, standalone bar graph format: **chairside milling**: 7%. **scans sent to manufacturers / milling centers**: 91%. **scans sent to other partner labs**: 15%. **impressions sent to manufacturers / milling centers**: 30%. **impressions sent to other partner labs**: 6%. *analysis:** the graph highlights that dental practices predominantly outsource digital scans and impressions to manufacturers or milling centers, with a significant 91% and 30% respectively. moreover, it indicates a lower percentage (7%) of dental practices opting for chairside milling, which involves in-house manufacturing. the remaining 15% of scans are sent to other partner labs, while only 6% of impressions follow the same route. *annotations and labels:** the primary axes are labeled clearly to differentiate between the different categories: the vertical axis represents the percentage of dental practices using these specific channels. the horizontal axis is divided into categories: \"chairside milling,\" \"scans sent to other partner labs,\" \"scans sent to manufacturers / milling centers,\" and \"impressions sent to other partner labs.\" both bar graphs share the same color coding and percentage details but are presented with a slight variation in labels versus the larger overall chart. this breakdown can provide insights into the utilization patterns of dental practices regarding digital technologies. the prevalence of outsourcing to manufacturers or milling centers emphasizes modern, fast, and efficient production methods.", "type": "Document"}}
