if yes, in whom do you consider the market?\" it highlights that the survey results suggest there is increasing interest if one intends to buy an intraoral scanner for the future, although a significant portion are not sure yet. the additional text below the survey results explains that this interest is based on the results of a study comparing technologies for treating malocclusions in patients as they age. the table provided below the bar chart gives information on the acceptance of different types of braces over time. this helps in understanding the trend and demand for orthodontic treatments.", "type": "Document"}}
