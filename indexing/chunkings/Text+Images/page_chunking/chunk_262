ivocar.\" the graph is a detailed representation of perceptions of the brand \"ivocar.\" **top title section:** the heading \"brand image: focus on brands - ivocar\" at the top, with explanatory text underneath that prompts viewers to rate their opinion on various brand characteristics. the measurement scale is from 1 (totally irrelevant) to 5 (totally relevant) and includes neutral (3), partially irrelevant (2), quite relevant (4), and totally relevant (5) ratings. **survey categories:** - this company has a high reputation (37% totally relevant, 47% quite relevant, 47% neutral, 26% partially relevant, 3% totally irrelevant) - this company has products with the highest quality (42% totally relevant, 43% quite relevant, 31% partially relevant, 4% totally irrelevant) -

purple: totally relevant - red: partially relevant - yellow: neutral - orange: quite relevant - green: totally irrelevant **bottom labels:** the brand name \"ivocar\" followed by \"mean\" indicating the average scores for all surveyed aspects and \"all brands\" illustrating the mean responses for all brands, presented in a bar format. the image contains two distinct parts, with the second image being a close-up screenshot from the first image. the first image is a detailed report or infographic titled \"brand image: focus on brands - ivocarl\" and is accompanied by various metrics and color-coded data regarding brand perception. the second image, specifically highlighted in the first image's central bottom part, focuses on brand image with a minimalist design. it displays two stylized line graphics, one labeled in pink \"all brands\" and the other in blue \"ivocarl.\" these lines, which seem to be parts of a continuation, connect to specific points under the two categories: \"all brands\" and \"ivocarl.\" the graphic provides a visual representation suggesting a comparative measurement or connection between the two brands, possibly indicating a relationship or evaluation. this minimalist design of the second image serves as an illustration of the underlying comparative data presented in the more extensive first image. the image contains a series of statements regarding the company's attributes and products, formatted into the same style and layout as shown in the first image. the content and font are identical, and they are presented as a mirror image of the first chart. here is a detailed description following the style of the first image: at the top, under the brand image title, \"brand image: focus on brands - ivocar\", followed by the same instructions \"in your opinion, how do you rate the mentioned brands in the following areas?\", and the scoring legend. below this, the following questions are provided: - \"this company has a high reputation - \"this company has products with the highest quality\" - \"this company has a long-time tradition\" - \"the products of this company are the easiest to use\" - \"i trust this company more than others - \"i think that it is the right company when i look for innovation\" - \"i feel this company to be among the most customer-oriented ones\" - \"i feel this company to be among the most familiar and friendly one\" - \"this company supports my business development more than others\" - \"the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio\" the same answers are to be rated with a scale from 1 (totally irrelevant) to 5 (totally relevant), with the color gradient from orange to blue indicating different levels of relevance and neutrality. next to each statement, on the right side, there's a vertical bar graph labeled with 'mean', indicating the average relevance of the statements for both 'all brands' and 'ivocar' categories (with corresponding mean scores ranging from 2.0 for 'all brands' to 4.0 for 'ivocar'). each statement has a series of color-coded percentages representing the degree of relevance or neutrality: - red (1 or totally irrelevant) - deep yellow (2 or partially irrelevant) - yellow (3 or neutral) - blue (4 or quite relevant) - bright blue (5 or totally relevant) the visual presentation is coherent, consistent with the design in the first image, ensuring the focus remains on the comparative analysis of the brand image perception. the image contains a data table presenting the distribution of brand image perceptions across different categories. the information is displayed in a color-coded format, with varying responses ranging from 'totally irrelevant' to 'totally relevant.' the table categorizes brands from 'all brands' and 'ivoclar' with a specified sample size for each group: 1,142 all brands and 144 ivoclar. each row in the table lists a specific brand attribute, while each column depicts the responses in varying shades of blue, yellow, and orange. the response categories are specified on the left side and each cell's content aligns with these categories. for example, the first row indicates a high brand reputation with the highest proportion (47%) considering this attribute 'totally relevant,' followed by 36% for 'quite relevant.' conversely, 'partially irrelevant' has a small percentage (2%), while 'totally irrelevant' has no significant response. similarly, for product quality, more respondents find it 'totally relevant' (42% for 'all brands), as opposed to 26% who find it 'totally irrelevant.' another notable characteristic is the consistent higher percentage responses for 'all brands' as compared to 'ivoclar,' indicating a broader, possibly more nuanced understanding of brand attributes in the general population or that 'ivoclar' is possibly a subset of the general brands. the overall layout of the table is structured for easy comparison, with colors aiding in understanding the distribution. the last row shows the average (mean) responses across all attributes, where 'all brands' averages more positively colored bars (mainly blue and yellow), suggesting a higher positive brand perception, while 'ivoclar' shows slightly lower percentages yet still maintains majority relevance.", "type": "Document"}}
