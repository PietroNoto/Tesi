scanner or also the mill? 68 base: 190 cases potentially interested among those who think about futurely investing in cad-cam technology, half of them thinks about buying a chairside. random sample the second image displays a bar chart, similar to the one in the first image, but it is presented in a more simplified and isolated form. the bar chart features two bars corresponding to intra-oral scanner and cad-cam milling unit, each with a specific percentage value. *intra-oral scanner:** the bar representing intra-oral scanner is the larger of the two, colored in a dark shade of blue. the percentage value indicated is 97%. *cad-cam milling unit:** the second bar, colored in a light shade of blue, represents the cad-cam milling unit. the percentage value indicated is 48%. the labels and legends are positioned adjacent to each bar without the extensive labeling or additional context found in the first image. this suggests a focus on illustrating the comparison in simple numerical proportions rather than providing a detailed survey breakdown such as age range or the number of dental chairs. the format is less complex, likely aiming for quick and easy visual reference or a basic report summary. the image contains a set of bar graphs showing various statistics related to the buying intention of dental practitioners for either an intra-oral scanner or a cad-cam milling unit. the graphs present data based on age and number of dental chairs. the first bar graph in the top left corner provides an overall summary and then proceeds to represent the distribution across different factors. it indicates that out of the responses, 97% of respondents are inclined towards the intra-oral scanner, whereas 48% prefer the cad-cam milling unit. the graph provides data points across various categories: age of the practice owner: aged 40 and under, 40-50, over 50, and older than 50 show a majority preference for the intra-oral scanner. number of dental chairs: single chairs, 1-2 chairs, 3 or more chairs, and those who opt for precision impressions per week. each category shows a strong inclination towards the intra-oral scanner. the second graph displays a similar pattern but offers a quantification breakdown: up to 40: 33% for the cad-cam, 98% for the scanner. from 41-50: 49% for cad-cam, 95% for the scanner. more than 50: 65% for cad-cam, 98% for the scanner. 1: 33% for cad-cam, 98% for the scanner. 2 or more: 42% for cad-cam, 98% for the scanner. precision impressions per week: 46% for cad-cam, 98% for the scanner. yes, we have a protristic technician in the practice: 46% for cad-cam, 98% for the scanner. additionally, the title and subtitle of the graph emphasize the consideration of whether a dental practice owns a chairside intra-oral scanner and the corresponding perception forcad-cam milling units as potential future investments. the image contains two bar charts placed adjacent to each other, with the first bar chart being a sub-section of the larger infographic displayed in image- this second image focuses on a specific subset of data within image- in the second image, there are three bar charts arranged side by side, each presenting data on whether individuals, specifically dentists and cosmetic dentistry professionals, would buy an intra-oral scanner or cad-cam milling unit, along with additional demographic information. the accompanying text indicates that the data are part of a random sample of 190 cases, from a population interested in investing in cad-cam technology. the first bar chart represents dentists aged 41 to 50 years old, divided into groups based on the number of dental chairs: up to 5 chairs: 98% of dentists aged 41 to 50 would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. 5 to 10 chairs: 98% of dentists aged 41 to 10 would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. more than 10 chairs: 98% of dentists aged 41 to 40 would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. the second bar chart represents dentists aged \"more than 50 years\" divided into groups based on the number of dental chairs: up to 5 chairs: 100% of dentists aged 50 and above would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. more than 5 chairs: 95% of dentists aged 50 and above would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. the third bar chart presents data on cosmetic dentistry professionals, divided into groups based on whether they have a partner laboratory or not, and in groups based on the number of dental chairs they have: yes, we have: - up to 5 chairs: the data for dental professionals with up to 5 chairs isnt provided. - more than 5 chairs: 98% of cosmetic dentistry professionals with more than 5 dental chairs would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. no, we do not have: - up to 5 chairs: 55% of cosmetic dentistry professionals without a partner laboratory would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. - more than 5 chairs: 46% of cosmetic dentistry professionals without a partner laboratory and more than 5 dental chairs would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. the results show a clear trend where a large majority of dentists and cosmetic dentistry professionals, irrespective of their age or the quantity of their dental chairs, would prefer purchasing a cad-cam milling unit over an intra-oral scanner, especially as their practice size increases. the data also highlights the importance of having a partner laboratory, as professionals without one tend to have a slightly lower percentage of those who would consider purchasing a milling unit. the image contains a bar graph showing the percentage of respondents aged 'up to 50' and 'more than 5' weekly precision impressions they have. for the group with 'up to 5', the blue bar reaches a height of 53%, while the black bar is significantly taller at 98%. for'more than 5', the black bar again dominates, standing at 98%, while the blue bar reaches 40%.", "type": "Document"}}
