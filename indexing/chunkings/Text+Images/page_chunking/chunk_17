18 chart 19a and 19b. use of digital technologies breakdown by technology and channel europe in overall, it is also possible to analyze the information shown at slides 15 and 17 by crossing the data, whose results are shown in the following chart. the chart shows in the rows the information regarding the technologies (in-lab milling, scanner and full outsourcing). in the columns the information is related to both the channels and the technologies. the information can be read as follows: with regard to the technology users, out of the total scanner users (red circled data, respondents using a scanner to send the scan files outside for milling), in 11% of the cases they also have an in-lab milling at the laboratory, and in 10% of the cases they also send the models outside for milling (either to a manufacturer/milling center or a partner lab). on the other hand, with regard to the channel users, out of the total manufacturer users (blue circled data, respondents sending either the models or scan files to a manufacturer/milling center), in 91% of the cases they send the scan files to a manufacturer, in 11% of the cases they have an in-lab milling, and in 19% of the cases they also send their models outside for milling to a manufacturer. this is a kind of multiple answer question. also, the same information is available with the channels in rows, and in the columns there are again both the channels and the technologies. the information can be read as follows: with regard to the technology users, out of the total scanner users (red circled data, respondents sending their scan files outside for milling), in 85% of the image contains a bar chart titled \"use of digital technologies breakdown by technology and channel europe.\" it provides data on the utilization of digital technologies in different channels, specifically focusing on \"in-lab milling,\" \"scanner,\" and \"full outsourcing,\" across four channels: \"scanner technology,\" \"manufacturer channel,\" \"partner lab,\" and \"full outsourcing.\" each channel's corresponding data is represented by three bars, each colored differently to signify the technology type: blue for in-lab milling, cyan for scanner, and light blue for full outsourcing. the bars are segmented to show the percentage usage of each technology in each channel. key observations from the image: 1. **scanner technology**: the scanner technology shows high utilization across all channels, particularly in the full outsourcing and partner lab channels. it is especially noteworthy given its emphasis in the channel and technology labels. 2. **full outsourcing**: there is significant usage in this category, with a very high percentage in \"scanner\" and \"full outsourcing\" channels, indicating a substantial reliance or preference in this segment. 3. **manufacturer channel**: this channel is heavily focused on scanner technology, illustrating a specific area where this technology is crucial. 4. **partner lab**: the channel highlights both in-lab milling and full outsourcing equally across all technologies but with a notable presence of scanner technology. additionally, the text beneath the chart provides detailed percentages, indicating a combined analysis where: - in-lab milling exhibits almost 100% usage in the labor or full outsourcing context. - scanner has a high utilization rate, especially in manufacturer channels. - full outsourcing shows almost 100% in partnership lab channels. cross-referencing the data suggests nuanced insights into how different technologies are utilized across various segments in europe. the detailed color-coding and distinct segmented percentages ensure a comprehensive breakdown, ideal for comparative analysis and decision-making in digital technology deployment. the image contains a section of a page from a report titled \"key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015 - executive summary - 18\". this specific section highlights a figure (chart 19a and 19b) relating to the use of digital technologies, specifically broken down by technology and channel within europe. the focus is on digital technology use, categorized into three channels: in-lab milling, manufacturer channel, and partner lab. the chart is visually presented using horizontal bar graphs to display the breakdown of responses for each category across the three channels. the categories under technology are in-lab milling (represented in blue), scanner (represented in dark red), and full outsourcing (represented in light blue). *detailed breakdown:** #### channel - in-lab milling: **in-lab milling:** 100% in in-lab milling, 0% in scanner, and 100% in partner lab. #### channel - manufacturer channel: **in-lab milling:** 11% in in-lab milling, 9% in scanner, and 9% in full outsourcing. **scanner technology:** 85% in in-lab milling, 100% in manufacturer channel, and 4% in partner lab. **full outsourcing:** 4% in in-lab milling, 44% in partial outsourcing, and 84% in manufacturer channel. #### channel - partner lab: **in-lab milling:** 11% in in-lab milling, 9% in full outsourcing, and 8% in manufacturer channel. **scanner technology:** 8% in in-lab milling, 95% in partner lab, and 5% in full outsourcing. **full outsourcing:** 11% in in-lab milling, 48% in full outsourcing, and 100% in partner lab. the use of different colored bars emphasizes the primary channel (blue for in-lab milling, dark red for scanner, and light blue for full outsourcing) across each channel type (indicated by circles on the bars). the charts show percentages indicating the distribution and preference of different digital technologies across the specified channels. the specific circle highlights depict the proportionate contributions or preference of the different technologies (in-lab milling, scanner, and full outsourcing) per each channel, reflecting how significantly each technology is utilized and preferred across different production channels within europe in 2015. *analysis:** the information presented shows that scanner technology is most utilized with 85% in the manufacturer channel and most often used in the in-lab milling by 11% of respondents within this industry. on the other hand, full outsourcing technology is predominantly used in the partner lab, which implies it might be more strategic for external collaborations. the figures give insight into the operational dynamics and strategic decisions within the production channels in european digital industries of 2015.", "type": "Document"}}
