the bars show 42% for detractor (-6%), 22% for neutral, and 36% for defensor (13%). 2. **open technologies** - the bars show 32% for detractor, 32% for neutral, and 36% for defensor. 3. **amanngirrback** - the bars show 33% for detractor, 20% for neutral, and 47% for defensor. the text below indicates that the data has been aggregated from survey responses and categorized according to nps, with a note highlighting that the nps value is considered satisfactory above additionally, the text points out the highest and lowest aggregate responses for detractor and defensor, respectively. the image contains a bar chart that summarizes the net promoter score (nps) classification results across different categories. the chart is titled \"otros indicadores: net promoter score\" which translates to \"other indicators: net promoter score.\" it uses stacked bar diagrams divided into segments representing detractors (shown in red), neutral (yellow), and defenders (shown in blue) respondents. the chart has three main categories: 1. **overall**: this category shows the average net promoter score (nps) for the entire evaluation. - detractor (red) bar: 42% - neutral (yellow) bar: 22% - defender (blue) bar: 36% a mean nps value is also provided along with a value of \"7.1.\" 2. **open technologies**: this category represents the nps classification results specific to open technologies. - detractor (red) bar: 32% - neutral (yellow) bar: 32% - defender (blue) bar: 36% the mean nps is indicated with a value of \"6.5.\" 3. **amannirrbach**: this category looks into the results for amann girrbach. - detractor (red) bar: 33% - neutral (yellow) bar: 20% - defender (blue) bar: 47% the mean nps for this category is \"11.5.\" 4. **3shape**: this category details the nps classification results for 3shape. - detractor (red) bar: 38% - neutral (yellow) bar: 23% - defender (blue) bar: 38% the mean nps for this category is \"5.7.\" the image also contains descriptive texts on the right side. it mentions that the possible responses (detractor, neutral, and defender labels) have been grouped into three clusters based on their nps values for the detractor group between 0 to 5, neutral group between 6 to 8, and defender group between 9 to it further highlights that the mean nps values appear to have low values overall but points out that the values in the defender group are noteworthy. in sum, the second image, a simplified representation of the first image, highlights the average nps values for various categories and the percentage of detractor, neutral, and defender groups. the image contains a series of horizontal bar charts presented in two sections, with the top section labeled \"overall\" and the bottom labeled \"open technologies.\" each section shows three distinct horizontal bar charts with three categories each, labeled as \"detractor,\" \"neutral,\" and \"defensor.\" the bars are color-coded: red for \"detractor,\" beige for \"neutral,\" and blue for \"defensor.\" each segment of the bar charts is accompanied by a vertical percentage value representing the share of those responses in the context of the question answered. for the \"overall\" category: the \"detractor\" response has a percentage value of 42%. the \"neutral\" has 22%, slightly differentiated by a green color. the \"defensor\" has a 36% share. on the adjacent side, indicating \"open technologies\": the same structure is repeated with orange (detractor), beige (neutral), and blue (defensor) bars with corresponding individual percentages. for \"open technologies,\" - the \"detractor\" response holds 32%. - \"neutral\" holds 32%. - \"defensor\" holds 36%. moving further down, the \"amanngirrach\" section illustrates: the \"detractor\" response has a 33% share. the \"neutral\" holds 20%. the \"defensor\" has a 47% share, significantly higher compared to others. the last section labeled \"3shape\" is as follows: the \"detractor\" has a share of 38%. \"neutral\" shares are smaller at 23%. \"defensor\" is represented by the largest section with a 38% share. on the right side of the charts, there is a graph showing numerical data which includes specific values: \"-6%\" for \"overall\" on \"detractor,\" \"7.2\" for \"neutral,\" \"4%\" for \"overall\" on \"defensor,\" \"0%\" for \"amanngirrach\" on \"detractor,\" \"6.9\" for \"neutral,\" \"13%\" for \"amanngirrach\" on \"defensor,\" \"0%\" for \"3shape,\" and \"2%\" for \"defensor.\" additionally, a note mentions the reference to meyers as the scale for these punctual responses.", "type": "Document"}}
