8 use of digital technologies breakdown by channel and technology in overall, for the remaining 32% of dental practices in europe offering digital restorations, they were invited to specify how they offer this service. chart use of digital technologies breakdown by channel the most frequent way to provide digital restorations is through partner laboratories, possibly located close to the practice, by sending them either the impressions or the scans. 16% of respondents send their impressions (or scans) to a manufacturer/milling center, while a relevant 14% of the sample provides digital restorations through their own chairside-milling unit. chart use of digital technologies breakdown by channel europe vs. breakdown per country the image contains a chart titled \"use of digital technologies breakdown by channel\" which is a detailed analysis of how digital technologies are utilized by dental professionals across different channels and technologies. the chart specifically focuses on two channels: \"impressions/models\" and \"intraoral scanner files.\" ### breakdown by channel and technology the first row in the chart shows the utilization of \"impressions/models\" which is divided into a partnership with \"partner lab\" and \"cad-cam manuf/milling center.\" there is a notable 80% of the dental professionals sending their impressions or models to partner labs, while 87% send them to cad-cam manual/milling centers. this information reveals a preference among professionals for sending their data directly to manufacturing centers that utilize cad-cam technology. the second row shows the usage of \"i have a chairside milling system\" channel, which is utilized by 14% of professionals, representing a significant presence in the industry but relatively smaller compared to the use of partner labs and cad-cam centers. the third row displays the \"intraoral scanner files\" channel. here, 14% of dental professionals send these files to partner labs, and similar figures are seen (9% and 87%) in cad-cam centers and manually handled/monitored (chairside milling). the slight preference indicates a trend among professionals utilizing intraoral data to rely more on cad-cam centers than other channels. a distinct feature of the chart is the percentage distribution per country, with individual breakdowns for six countries: **partner lab:** - germany (de): 87% - france (fr): 75% - italy (it): 17% - spain (sp): 16% - united kingdom (uk): 50% - china: 43% **manuf/milling center:** - germany: 16% - france: 23% - italy: 12% - spain: 4% - united kingdom: 27% - china: 27% **chairside milling:** - germany: 12% - france: 14% - italy: 16% - spain: 10% - united kingdom: 43% - china: 8% ### detailed observations: 1. **impressions/models**: this is the dominant channel with a significant disparity between partner labs and cad-cam centers, showcasing a clear preference for digital, automated solutions over traditional manual ones. 2. **chairside milling system**: despite a smaller percentage (14%), this still suggests a reliance on immediate, on-site milling capabilities for some professionals, especially within germany. 3. **intraoral scanner files**: the cad-cam centers and chairside milling systems are notably used for handling intraoral scanner data, suggesting a trend towards integrating advanced imaging technologies with immediate processing workflows. ### relevant insights: the data presented reflects the modern shift in dental practices towards integrating advanced digital technology for improving efficiency, precision, and workflow streamlining in their dental restorations. this chart provides crucial insights into the technology adoption patterns in different countries, highlighting the role of partner labs, manufacturing centers, and on-site milling systems across geographies. the image contains stacked bar charts titled \"use of digital technologies breakdown by channel.\" the charts analyze the percentage distribution of methods for sending digital restorations to manufacturers across europe. the image is part of a broader data report on digital technologies in dental practice by the company keystone omnivision. key points: 1. **partner lab:** - most dominant channel for digital restorations, with 87% in europe sending digital restorations through their partner laboratories. - the percentage is mirrored across all countries under the wider category of \"partner lab.\" specific country breakdown: - uk: 92% - sp: 87% - it: 75% - fr: 87% - de: 87% - eu: 87% 2. **manuf/milling center:** - 16% of the samples from europe send digital restorations to manufacturers' mills. - the breakdown per country: - uk: 93% - sp: 17% - it: 23% - fr: 14% - de: 12% - eu: 12% 3. **chairside milling:** - 14% send digital restorations using chairside milling. - country breakdown: - uk: 71% - sp: 43% - it: 16% - fr: 50% - de: 28% - eu: 28% each stack of bars provides a visual representation of the proportions for each channel across various countries in europe. the tallest bars correspond to the partner lab method, with some variability among the percentage distribution for the other channels. notably, the uk consistently shows higher percentages for sending to manufactures mills and chairside milling than most other countries.", "type": "Document"}}
