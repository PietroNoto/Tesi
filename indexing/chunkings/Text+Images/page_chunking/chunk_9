10 chart use of digital technologies breakdown by technology europe vs. breakdown per country the analysis by country highlights italy as the one with the highest penetration of intraoral scanners and chairside milling users among digital restorations providers. despite a low number of cases, uk shows a different behavior compared to the rest of the evaluated countries, with a higher than average percentages shown in the use of both intraoral scanners and chairside milling units. considering the reduced number of cases, this information can only be considered as an indication. chart 8a and 8b. use of digital technologies breakdown by channel and technology europe in overall, it is also possible to analyze the information shown at slides 4 and 6 by crossing the data, whose results are shown in the following charts. the chart shows in the rows the information regarding the channels (partner lab, manufacturer/milling center and chairside milling). in the columns the information is related to both the channels and the technologies. the information can be read as follows: with regard to the technology users, out of the total impression users (red circled data, respondents sending their impressions outside for milling), in 94% of the cases, they send the impressions to the partner lab channel, in 17% of the cases they send the impressions to the manufacturer/milling center channel, and 5% of them also have a chairside milling. on the other hand, with regard to the channel users, out of the total partner lab the image contains two side-by-side bar charts stacked on a common base layout, each representing different statistical data. the chart on the left provides a comparison across multiple european countries and various technologies, while the chart on the right presents country-wise data. the chart on the left (labeled \"chart 7\" and \"chart 8\", \"use of digital technologies - breakdown by technology europe vs. breakdown per country\") has four stacked segments on the vertical axis. these segments represent different technologies: scanner, impression, and chairside milling. the countries listed on the horizontal axis are de (germany), fr (france), it (italy), sp (spain), and uk (united kingdom). 1. **scanner technology**: - germany: 83% - france: 86% - italy: 86% - spain: 94% - uk: 94% 2. **impression technology**: - germany: 86% - france: 83% - italy: 86% - spain: 94% - uk: 94% 3. **chairside milling**: - germany: 14% - france: 7% - italy: 7% - spain: 12% - uk: 50% the chart on the right (labeled \"chart 9\", \"use of digital technologies breakdown by channel and technology europe\") shows two categories: technologies (scanner, impression) and channels (partner lab, manufacturer/milling center). the percentages for each category are as follows: **technologies**: - scanner: 8% - impression: 94% - chairside milling: 9% **channels**: - partner lab: 12% - manufacturer/milling center: 86% additionally, the chart visualizes the breakdown of sending impressions to \"technology users\" across various channels. partner lab and manufacturer/milling center categories display 50% and 50% respectively. in conclusion, the image conveys detailed information about the usage and distribution of digital technologies across certain european countries, emphasizing the prevalence of impression and the dominance of the \"manufacturer/milling center\" channel in digital restoration services. the image contains two stacked bar graphs illustrating the breakdown of digital technology usage across different channels and technologies by country in europe. the top part, labeled \"chart use of digital technologies breakdown by technology,\" features bar graphs for two countries: italy and the uk. three technologies are evaluated: scanner, impression, and chairside milling. each bar represents the percentage of users within the respective country. in italy: scanner: 86% impression: 14% chairside milling: 12% in the uk: scanner: 94% impression: 50% chairside milling: 50% below these graphs, titled \"chart 8a and 8b. use of digital technologies breakdown by channel and technology,\" a second set of stacked bar graphs showcases usage for three channels (partner lab, manufacturer/milling center, and chairside milling) and two technologies (impression technology and scanner). the percentages are color-coded to indicate distinct data for each technology. for partner lab channel: impression technology: 94% scanner: 57% for manufacturer/milling center: impression technology: 17% scanner: 30% for chairside milling: impression technology: 5% scanner: 44% on the bottom right, there's a legend that matches the colors to corresponding percentages for partner lab, manufacturer/milling center, and chairside milling. each bar in the stack reflects the combined usage across the channels and technologies.", "type": "Document"}}
