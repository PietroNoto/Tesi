attributes include categories such as being highly reputable, innovative, worldwide known, reliable, trustworthy, recommender friendly to colleagues, a leading company, makes daily practice easier, customer service orientation, having a good price quality ratio, being too expensive, and being affordable. respondents rated each statement on how relevant it is to the brand they are about to read. for each attribute, three percentages are presented, indicating 'not relevant,' 'quite relevant,' and 'totally relevant,' respectively. over the 39 survey responses, the attributes are evaluated as follows: **highly reputable**: 14% not relevant, 35% quite relevant, 51% totally relevant **innovative and at the forefront**: 17% not relevant, 37% quite relevant, 45% totally relevant **worldwide known**: 19% not relevant, 31% quite relevant, 50% totally relevant **reliable**: 22% not relevant, 29% quite relevant, 49% totally relevant **trustworthy**: 23% not relevant, 37% quite relevant, 41% totally relevant **recommendable to colleagues**: 25% not relevant, 32% quite relevant, 43% totally relevant **leading company**: 24% not relevant, 34% quite relevant, 42% totally relevant **makes

11% totally relevant additionally, the graphical representation includes a horizontal bar graph showing the mean for each attribute where each dot corresponds to a different attribute. for most attributes, the dots hover closely around the same mean value, depicted in blue. roland's attributes are predominantly rated as 'totally relevant' (51% for 'highly reputable,' 45% for 'innovative,' etc.), indicating the brand's strong presence in those areas. in contrast, 'affordable' garnered significantly lower relevance scores, showing the least perceived importance by the respondents. overall, the chart offers insight into how consumers perceive roland, with significant relevance placed on qualities like reliability, reputation, and customer service. the graphical mean representations further support and visualize the survey data's distribution. the image contains a bar chart that represents survey responses for some unknown brand concerning characteristics. this chart is likely derived from a larger infographic like the one shown in image- here, it showcases how the brand is perceived based on different characteristics. it breaks down the responses into two sets, comparing them to an overall average set of responses. *content analysis:** **brand reputation:** the brand is described as being either \"highly reliable\" or \"trustworthy,\" but it doesnt match the overall brand reputation metrics well. **innovativeness and leaders in the market:** the brand does not rank highly as a market leader and is less innovative compared to the overall averages. **global reach and market share:** the brand seems to have a smaller market share globally, as indicated by the relatively low percentages compared to the overall averages. **customer service:** the service is rated quite positive, though it's not better than the overall average, indicating that while good, it may not be superior. **quality and value for money:** customers perceive the product as being of good quality, yet not exceptionally high-value. this suggests a standard quality-performance ratio. **cost and pricing:** some customers feel it's expensive which is a negative aspect, whereas others would say its affordable, suggesting mixed reviews on pricing. *visual and aesthetic details:** **legend and color coding:** the chart is color-coded for clarity blue for \"not relevant\" and pink for \"totally relevant.\" this ensures a visual demarcation between those who found a characteristic highly relevant and those who did not. **percentages:** each statement has a percentage assigned to each of the \"not relevant,\" \"quite relevant,\" and \"totally relevant\" categories. these percentages provide nuanced insight into how each characteristic was perceived by users. **layout and alignment:** the bars are neatly aligned, making it easy to compare how a specific characteristic of the brand compares to the overall market. the horizontal orientation of the bars facilitates a straightforward comparison of percentages visually. *summary:** the bar chart gives a detailed insight into how the brand has been perceived relative to an overall market standard. while certain aspects have mixed responses, the overall sentiment across various criteria suggests average perception with minor positive bias. this detailed examination enables effective analysis of how users of the brand feel about it's attributes when compared against more general market sentiment. the image contains a bar graph comparing public perceptions of the brand \"roland\" in relation to an overall average across a range of attributes. the graph, part of a survey presumably conducted by omi vision digital on behalf of key-stone, consists of two main parts. the first part (left of the image) is a bar graph demonstrating the ratings across 16 attributes, and the second part (right of the image) shows a scatter plot of the ratings, which serves to provide a visual comparison against an overall mean value. ### bar chart (left part) **title & scope**: the bar graph is titled \"brand positioning: roland.\" **response categories**: participants rated each statement on a 5-point scale with categories labeled from \"not relevant\" (represented by pink) to \"totally relevant\" (represented by dark blue). **number of responses**: the bars represent the responses of 652 participants for each category. **list of attributes**: - highly reputable (14% not relevant, 35% quite relevant, 51% totally relevant) - innovative and at the forefront (17% not relevant, 37% quite relevant, 46% totally relevant) - worldwide reknown (19% not relevant, 31% quite relevant, 50% totally relevant) - reliable (22% not relevant, 29% quite relevant, 49% totally relevant) - trustworthy (23% not relevant, 41% quite relevant, 46% totally relevant) - recommendable to colleagues (25% not relevant, 32% quite relevant, 43% totally relevant) - leading company (24% not relevant, 34% quite relevant, 42% totally relevant) - makes daily practice easier (27% not relevant, 35% quite relevant, 38% totally relevant) - customer service oriented (42% not relevant, 31% quite relevant, 27% totally relevant) - good price / quality ratio (49% not relevant, 28% quite relevant, 23% totally relevant) - too expensive (59% not relevant, 29% quite relevant, 11% totally relevant) - affordable (46% not relevant, 35% quite relevant, 19% totally relevant) ### scatter plot (right part) **axes**: the horizontal axis (x-axis) ranges from 3.0 to 5.0, while the vertical axis (y-axis) also ranges from 3.0 to 5.0, both depicting mean ratings. **data points**: the dots in each cluster represent individual respondents' ratings of roland against the overall brand average. **color and size of dots**: each dot is colored to match the relevant category described in the bar graph, from pink to dark blue. ### interpretation: the scatter plot visually organizes the respondents' ratings of roland's attributes compared to the overall brand mean, clustered by their degree of relevance. the mean of 4.5 is marked, demarcating the center of the perception spectrumwith roland's ratings generally higher than the average, indicating a positive public perception of the brand. the bar graph provides a numerical breakdown of specific attributes, whereas the scatter plot offers a more dynamic, visual comparison. these visual tools work together to provide comprehensive insights into consumer sentiment towards roland.", "type": "Document"}}
