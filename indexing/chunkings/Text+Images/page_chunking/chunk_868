(43 quotes) dentsply sirona overall mean overall brands (196 quotes) 47 the image contains a structured chain of hexagons with specific numerical values ranging from 3 to 4.5 distributed on a horizontal axis. the hexagons are various shades of pink, cyan, and teal, indicating different categories or values in a visual manner. each individual hexagon has a number embedded within it, which appears to signify certain metrics or measurements: starting from the left, the values progress as follows: 4.1, 4.0, 4.2, both 4.0, both 4.1, both 4.0, 4.9, 3.9, 4.8, repeating patterns of 3.8, 3.8, 3.8, and a final 3.4 towards the right. the numbers appear to be spread unevenly, showing clusters in some value ranges and gaps in others. at the edges of the chain, the transition involves teal coloration for the extremal values near the beginning and end, which signifies a potential distinction in the metrics conveyed. the central blocks are predominantly pink, perhaps indicating a general measure that is neither high nor at the extreme. no titles, labels, or additional explanatory text accompany these figures, making it challenging to decipher the exact meaning of the numbers. however, it is evident that the values differ and are displayed in descending order in terms of central concentration. while the image's abstract nature limits comprehension, the chain structure suggests a sequential or ordered process with measurable steps or stages, possibly illustrating a performance metric, statistical data point, or a series of quantitative outcomes. it is likely that this visualization is used as a data representation tool intended to convey specific, sequential relationships or values. the image contains a chart comparing the perceptions of two brands: overall brands and dentsply sirona based on 196 and 43 quotes respectively. the chart displays the percentage share attributed to different attributes, showing how responders categorized statements regarding brand reputation and functionality. in the left column, each attribute is listed for both brands, with three horizontal bars representing responses categorized as \"not relevant,\" \"quite relevant,\" and \"totally relevant.\" each bar is associated with a percentage value, aggregating responses for each category. the right column provides an aggregate mean value, showing an average perception across all brands and attributes included in the chart. attributes listed on the chart include \"highly reputable,\" \"trustworthy,\" \"worldwide known,\" \"warm and friendly,\" \"reliable,\" \"leading company,\" \"innovative and at the forefront,\" \"more for less,\" \"made for practical use,\" \"affordable,\" \"made from quality,\" \"too expensive,\" and \"made according to specifications.\" for example: \"highly reputable\" and \"trustworthy\" both share the same attributes values in both brands, with significant relevance in \"overall brands\" as 39% relevant, and even more so in \"dentsply sirona\" at 51% relevant. \"innovative and at the forefront\" is 29% total relevant in \"overall brands\" but even more so in \"dentsply sirona\" at 46% total relevant. conversely, \"too expensive\" has more mean relevance in the overall comparison at 33% compared to 28% for \"overall brands.\" specific attributes like \"affordable\" and \"too expensive\" see significant contrast between the two brands, with \"overall brands\" giving more considerations to affordability (55% total relevant), contrasted sharply by \"dentsply sirona\" (28% total relevant). highlighted key attributes are further represented in a summary bar on the far right, with different bars for \"dentsply sirona\" and \"overall brands,\" showing comparison mean values. in this case, \"dentsply sirona\" scores higher in attributes like \"innovative and at the forefront\" and \"made for practical use\" markedly. overall, these data illustrate how different attributes influence consumer perceptions significantly varying between overall and specific brands. this visual approach is used to synthesize comparative analysis effectively. the image contains a bar chart comparing the perception of statements regarding two distinct sets of brands. the chart consists of two sets of vertical bars: one for \"overall brands,\" containing a total of 196 statements rated, and another for \"dentsply sirona,\" with a total of 43 statements rated. both sets are compared through the lens of three response options: \"not relevant,\" \"quite relevant,\" and \"totally relevant.\" the percentage values representing each response category are displayed with orange bars, while the percentage of respondents who considered each statement relevant are depicted with blue bars. here are the statistics for each category of statements: **highly reputable:** - overall brands: 28% (not relevant), 39% (quite relevant), 33% (totally relevant) - dentsply sirona: 51% (totally relevant), 35% (quite relevant), 14% (not relevant) **trustworthy:** - overall brands: 28% (not relevant), 41% (quite relevant), 31% (totally relevant) - dentsply sirona: 26% (totally relevant), 51% (quite relevant), 23% (not

**innovative and at the forefront:** - overall brands: 28% (not relevant), 44% (quite relevant), 27% (totally relevant) - dentsply sirona: 26% (totally relevant), 40% (quite relevant), 34% (not relevant) **reliable:** - overall brands: 29% (not relevant), 27% (quite relevant), 44% (totally relevant) - dentsply sirona: 33% (totally relevant), 40% (quite relevant), 27% (not relevant) **leading company:** - overall brands: 33% (not relevant), 31% (quite relevant), 36% (totally relevant) - dentsply sirona: 51% (totally relevant), 40% (quite relevant), 9% (not relevant) **recommendable to colleagues:** - overall brands: 36% (not relevant), 33% (quite relevant), 31% (totally relevant) - dentsply sirona: 51% (totally relevant), 35% (quite relevant), 14% (not relevant) **makes daily practice easier:** - overall brands: 39% (not relevant), 24% (quite relevant), 37% (totally relevant) - dentsply sirona: 50% (totally relevant), 37% (quite relevant), 13% (not relevant) **customer service oriented:** - overall brands: 37% (not relevant), 24% (quite relevant), 39% (totally relevant) - dentsply sirona: 50% (totally relevant), 29% (quite relevant), 21% (not relevant)

ratio:** - overall brands: 55% (not relevant), 30% (quite relevant), 15% (totally relevant) - dentsply sirona: 35% (totally relevant), 53% (quite relevant), 12% (not relevant) overall, dentsply sirona generally presents higher rates of respondents categorizing their brand as \"totally relevant,\" especially in statements about their reputation, trustworthiness, and other attributes. however, both brands receive comparable ratings on multiple aspects, indicating a closer alignment of", "type": "Document"}}
