(scores from 0 extremely unlikely to 10 extremely likely) the possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores. the clustering is the following: detractor: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 0 to neutral: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to advocate: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 9 to mean: 6,6 n.p.s.: -10%

(-10% in 2018 vs -8% in 2015), the percentage of both the detractors and the advocates increases remarkably. due to the lower number of cases, these figures should be taken as an indication only. 72 the image contains a pie chart that presents results from a survey about how likely respondents are to recommend cad-cam company brands to colleagues, with response scores ranging from 0 to the chart is composed of three distinct segments, each representing a different group based on their perceived likelihood of recommendation. the segments are labeled as \"detractor,\" \"neutral,\" and \"advocate.\" the \"detractor\" segment occupies the largest portion of the pie chart, representing 40% of the responses. this group consists of individuals who have scores from 0 to 6, indicating they are the least likely to recommend the company brands. the \"neutral\" segment, comprising 30% of the responses, consists of individuals from the 'neutral' cluster who have scores ranging from 7 to these individuals neither strongly endorse nor discourage the recommendation of the brands. the \"advocate\" segment is the smallest and represents 30% of the survey respondents. this group comprises respondents with scores of 9 to 10, signifying they are the most likely to recommend the cad-cam company brands. additionally, each segment includes an average response score: the detractor's average score is 6.6, with a negative percentage change (denoted as n.p.s.: -10%). the neutrals' average score is 7.6, with a negative percentage change (n.p.s.: -8%). the advocates' average score is 7.6, with a negative percentage change (n.p.s.: 8%). below the pie chart, there is a comparison of the data from two years: the 2015 data notes that the detractor responses accounted for 68% with an average score of 7.6 and a negative 8% change in net promoter scores (n.p.s.: -8%). the 2018 data shows detractors making up 12% of the responses with an average score of 6.6 and a negative change of 10% in n.p.s.: -10%). at the bottom of the image, it is noted that the sample size for this survey was 30 cases, and the same perceived value scores in 2018 and 2015 have shown only slight changes, despite a noticeable increase in the percentage of detractors. overall, the pie chart effectively visualizes the distribution of responses across the three groups and indicates a significant portion of respondents who are less likely to recommend the cad-cam company brands (detractors), while a small but notable group of advocates are actively promoting the brands. the image contains a pie chart representing data from a specific set of responses related to the recommendation of certain cad-cam company brands to a colleague. the pie chart displays the percentage of respondents who would recommend these brands, divided into three distinct categories represented by different colors. the largest segment of the pie chart is colored in yellow and accounts for 68% of the responses. this indicates that a significant majority, 68% of the respondents, would be neutral in their recommendation, suggesting that in the eyes of these respondents, the company brand being evaluated neither strongly promotes nor discredits their use of the software. the second largest segment is colored in brown and represents 20% of the responses. this implies that a moderate percentage of respondents fall into the category of 'detractors,' meaning that they are somewhat likely to discourage their colleagues from using the software based on their experience. the smallest segment is colored in blue and takes up 12% of the responses. this category is labeled as 'advocates', indicating a smaller but appreciable minority who are strongly inclined towards promoting the software to their colleagues. at the center of the pie chart is a value labeled \"mean: 7.6 n.p.s.: -8%\", indicating the average score and a negative net promoter score (nps) of this score suggests general neutrality with a very small negative bias towards detracting from the software's use. the chart also shows annotations indicating that in 2015, there were a total of 25 cases with an average score of 7.6 and a similar negative nps of -8%, providing a historical context that the current data closely aligns with past trends. furthermore, text within the image suggests that a lower number of cases is considered, implying that the provided percentages and averages are significant in isolation but should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size. overall, the pie chart succinctly captures the sentiment among respondents regarding their likelihood of recommending the cad-cam software to colleagues, with most respondents showing neutrality and a modest inclination towards either advocating or deterring its use.", "type": "Document"}}
