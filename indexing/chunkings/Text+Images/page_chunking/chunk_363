**dark blue segment, 49%:** represents respondents who think that cad-cam will play an important role in the future, and traditional prosthesis will still be relevant. - **light blue segment, 45%:** indicates respondents who believe cad-cam technology will substitute traditional prosthesis. - **red segment, 11%:** reflects the practitioners who think that cad-cam will serve a limited role. - **green segment, 5%:** indicates respondents who are uncertain or have no opinion on cad-cam's role. ### bar graphs (right section): there are three sets of bar graphs arranged below the pie chart. - **first set of bar graphs (age group of the practice owner):** these bars represent the percentage of respondents in different age groups up to 40, from 41 to 50, more than 50, and up to 53 years old. these bars have different segmented heights indicating the respondents' views similarly to those shown in the pie chart. - **second set of bar graphs (number of dental chairs):** this set includes respondents from practice settings of: - **up to 4 dental chairs:** with different subdivisions showing the percentage of respondents within each group. - **from 41 to 50 dental chairs:** again with different subdivisions. - **more than 50 dental chairs:** with a similar subdivided presentation. - **1 dental chair:** indicating the perception of respondents with a single dental chair practice. - **third set of bar graphs (social class of patients):** this set categorizes respondents by the social class of the patients: - **high / mid-high class patients:** presenting segmented heights across different patient class categories. - **middle class patients:** shows the segmented height values for this class. - **(c/d class patients):** represents respondents from practice serving patients from classes c/d. - **lower class (f class):** the smallest segmented height value representing this population. ### analysis: each bar graph has a visual representation of respondents' views similar to the first pie chart. they show different responses and perceptions based on practice owner's age, number of dental chairs, and social class of patients. this arrangement allows for a detailed comparative analysis across different parameters, offering a comprehensive view of how various factors influence the perceived impact of cad-cam technology. the overall structure, layout, and color coding within the charts facilitate easy comparison and understanding of the data presented.", "type": "Document"}}
