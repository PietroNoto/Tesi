breakdown by channel how do you provide digital restorations in your practice? 15 base: 323 cases the most frequent way to provide digital restorations is through the traditional channel, by sending the impressions or the scans to a dental lab or a manufacturer/milling center. 14% of providers of digital restorations do have a chairside milling. focus on digital restoration providers the image contains a bar chart that details the different channels utilized for providing digital restorations in dentistry. the chart is labeled \"scenario: digital technology use - breakdown by channel\" and is positioned on the right side of the page, with a text box explaining the focus on digital restoration providers. key elements and data in the bar chart: the bars are color-coded with various shades of blue to differentiate between different channels. four primary channels are listed vertically on the chart: 1. **impressions/models sent to a partner lab**: dominates the chart with an 80% usage rate, represented by the longest bar in dark blue. 2. **impressions/models sent to a cad-cam manuf/milling center**: represented by a shorter blue bar and accounts for 14%. 3. **i have a chairside milling system**: another 14% of the responses go through this channel, depicted by almost identical length to the cad-cam manuf/milling center. 4. **intraoral scanner files sent to a partner lab**: this channel is used by a smaller group, totaling 9%, with a shorter blue bar. further below, there is a category labeled **intraoral scanner files sent to a cad-cam manuf/milling center**: - this channel accounts for 4% and is slightly shorter than the prior 9% group. additional information: at the bottom of the chart, there is a small gray bar labeled **don't know**, representing 1% of the responses. overall, the chart highlights that the predominant method for digital restoration providers is sending impressions/models to a partner lab, while cad-cam manuf/milling centers and intraoral scanner files sent to labs follow significantly behind, albeit still with notable usage rates. the text box accompanying the chart reinforces that the majority of digital restoration providers use the traditional channel, which includes either sending impressions or files to a lab or utilizing a manufacturing/milling center. each response is based on a base of 323 cases, indicating a solid foundation for the statistical breakdown provided. the background of the chart includes a faint watermark text that seems to be part of another document or image partially visible through the overlay of the chart. analyzing the data allows for understanding that most dentistry labs primarily rely on traditional methods via partner labs, with cad-cam manuf/milling centers and chairside milling systems also frequently used. however, there are notable preferences for partner labs overall, aligning with long-standing industry practices in digitization of dental restorations. the image contains a bar graph titled \"focus on digital restoration providers,\" which appears to be a visual representation extracted from a presentation slide. the bar graph is simple, showing three horizontal bars in varying shades of blue and one small segment in blue at the bottom. the largest bar represents \"partner lab\" with a percentage of 87%, indicating that a significant portion of digital restoration providers predominantly rely on partner lab. the second bars represent \"manuf/milling center\" and \"chairside milling,\" each with 16% and 14% respectively. this suggests that around a fifth of providers use manuf/milling centers, and slightly fewer use chairside milling. the color palette is understated, with darker blue for the higher percentages (87% for partner lab) and lighter blue for the lower percentages (16% for manuf/milling center and 14% for chairside milling). there are no additional texts or annotations on the bars other than the labels and the percentages shown. above the bar graph, the text reads \"fo\" possibly truncated, which suggests a placeholder or partial word. however, it continues to mention \"digital restoration providers.\" below the graph, two smaller bar graphs appear, potentially providing a breakdown or supporting data related to the main graph, but these are cropped and thus not fully visible or readable in the provided image. the image also includes a title, \"scenario: digital technology use - breakdown by channel,\" explaining that this graph categorizes provider preferences by channel for digital restoration usage. other text on the slide discusses various ways digital restoration providers handle their work, such as sending files to partner labs, cad-cam centers, and others, reflecting distribution across various channels. at the bottom-left corner of the image, the text indicates the base number of cases which was \"323 cases,\" giving context to the data's scope. the slide seems professional and well-structured, utilizing a clean design for clarity, with branding elements (like \"omnivision\" logo and \"key-stone\" logo on the sides), indicating corporate affiliation or presentation sponsorship, and suggesting a detailed breakdown of data collection.", "type": "Document"}}
