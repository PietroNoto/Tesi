39% (dark blue) - no interest - 17% (light blue) - no demand - 6% (pink) - too expensive - 8% (green) - technical difficulties - 21% (gray) - prefer the conventional method - 1% (yellow) - familiarity with technology - 2% (light gray) - other (not listed by the color code on the first chart) 2. **2018 (131 cases)**: - 37% (dark blue) - no interest - 26% (light blue) - no demand - 4% (pink) - too expensive - 7% (green) - technical difficulties - 10% (gray) - prefers the conventional method - 3% (yellow) - familiarity with technology - 4% (light gray) - other (not listed by the color code on the first chart) arrows connect these categories, indicating a cross-reference between them, which visually highlights the continuity or changes in preferences from 2015 to the dark blue and light blue bars represent the most consistently prevalent areas with no interest or no demand, highlighting a persistent lack of engagement even in the red and diagonal arrows represent a category that the respondents did not choose, suggesting an area not significant in the survey but perhaps indicating low preference. the gray bars show preferences for conventional methods, which have slightly dropped from 21% in 2015 to 10% in 2018, demonstrating a shift in preference. the colored bars also indicate an increase in the 'familiarity with technology' category from 1% to 3%, suggesting a growing acceptance but not widespread demand. the image contains a pie chart that is a central element of the graphic content presented on the first page. this pie chart is divided into two segments, representing the responses to a survey question posed in spanish: \"\u00bftiene intenci\u00f3n de comprar un esc\u00e1ner intraoral, una unidad de fuerza \u201cchairside\u201d o una unidad de impresi\u00f3n 3d en los pr\u00f3ximos dos a\u00f1os?\" which translates to \"do you intend to buy an intraoral scanner, a 'chairside' force unit or a 3d printing unit in the next two years?\" the chart provides statistics on the respondents' intended purchase of these technologies over the next two years. the image shows a pie chart with blue and gray segments. - the blue segment, which represents \"yes,\" accounts for 42% of the responses. - the gray segment, which represents \"no,\" comprises the remaining 58%. the pie chart is visually clear and provides a quick way to understand the primary distribution of responses. there is no specific segmentation or categorization of the responses beyond these two main groups. the image contains a table detailing reasons for patients to refuse cardiac rehabilitation programs, differentiating between the responses in 2015 and it highlights that the year-over-year index was 1.91 in 2018 versus 1.36 in 2015, and it uses the percentages of responses over time to illustrate trends in patient preferences. the table is color-coded to represent different factors affecting patients' decisions: 1. **derasiado caro** (too expensive): represented in dark blue, there\u2019s a slight decrease from 39% in 2015 to 37% in 2018. 2. **no interesa** (not interesting): represented in light blue, with a slight increase from 26% in 2015 to 31% in 2018. 3. **me estoy retirando** (i am retiring): shown in green, this category has a consistent trend of 2% from both years. 4. **baja precisi\u00f3n del sistema** (low system precision): displayed in purple, remains at 1% consistently. 5. **poca familiaridad con la tecnolog\u00eda** (few familiarity with technology): represented in red, increases slightly from 1% in 2015 to 2% in on the right side of the table, reasons for needing a rehabilitation program: 1. **no lo necesito** (no need for it): represented in dark blue, slightly rising from 10% in 2015 to 12% in 2018. 2. **baja demanda** (low demand): represented in pink, increasing from 7% to 9%. 3. **tengo otras prioridades** (i have other priorities): represented in green, increasing from 4% to 5%. 4. **prefiero el m\u00e9todo tradicional** (prefer traditional method): represented in orange, remaining stable at 3%. 5. **otro** (other): represented in purple, holding steady at 1%. the key indicators and corresponding reasons help analyze patient motivations and preferences more comprehensively.", "type": "Document"}}
