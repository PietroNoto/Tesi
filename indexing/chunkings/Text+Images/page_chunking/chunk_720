that helps to identify and measure the influence of the independent variables (in this case, current and former users) on the dependent one (in this case, the overall satisfaction). the bivariate correlation analysis has been used to quantify the relation between the score on the single satisfaction items and the rating on the overall satisfaction. therefore, it is possible to retrieve a hierarchy of importance from the individual statements and to display them in a chart, and then on a map. the vertical axis always shows the satisfaction ratings that the different factors have received, on average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence on the overall satisfaction. in this way, its obtained an estimated importance of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a bit different from the one explicitly stated. the analysis of the weight of each of the factors, and not only of the declared importance, allows for some interesting considerations. the items have a different meaning according to the point of view with which they are considered: statistical note satisfaction related to the whole market here we can highlight some prerequisites (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors satisfy the market), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, where companies are not always able to satisfy customers with regard to strategic issues), and indifference areas (lower-left side of the map) which become waste/not efficient areas when a company decides to invest in those items belonging to the upper-left side of the map, since they tend to satisfy the market but they actually dont affect the overall satisfaction at all. satisfaction related to a specific company/product here the scheme is the same, but we can highlight the strength points in the upper-right side of the map, which can determine inefficiency or indifference if placed in the left side of the map. in the lower-right we can note an improvement area, where we can find the weak points of a certain company (higher than average weight on the company satisfaction but lower than average satisfaction score). 103 the image contains a venn diagram depicting the bivariate correlation analysis framework. this diagram visually differentiates the areas of 'waste/inefficiency,' 'prerequisites,' 'indifference,' and 'key success factors.' these categories are presented within overlapping circles on a coordinate plane, with each set of four circles intersecting to show varying levels of correlation in the respective parameters. 1. **waste/inefficiency**: represented by the light blue circle. areas categorized here typically comprise factors or practices that contribute to inefficiency or wastage, negatively impacting overall satisfaction. the intersection of 'waste/inefficiency' with 'prerequisites' and 'indifference' potentially highlights aspects that, despite being essential, become inefficient or are perceived as waste due to non-performance. 2. **prerequisites**: the pink circle on the right side of the diagram. prerequisites are fundamental requirements or essential components that a company needs to meet to achieve desired outcomes. their relationship with other factors, such as 'key success factors,' 'waste/inefficiency,' and 'indifference,' provides insight into whether they are efficiently fulfilling their role or leading to wasteful practices. 3. **key success factors**: the purple circle in the bottom right. these represent crucial elements that directly influence the attainment of success and overall customer satisfaction. their intersection with other circles can reveal how efficient these factors are, whether they align with prerequisites without inefficiencies, and contribute to or hinder the perception of waste and indifference. 4. **indifference**: the green circle on the bottom left. indifference here refers to factors or elements that do not significantly change or influence customer satisfaction strongly. the overlap of 'indifference' with 'prerequisites' and 'waste/inefficiency' might indicate where such factors play a passive role without positively affecting or significantly impacting satisfaction. to summarize, each circle in the venn diagram, when intersecting with the others, showcases the complexity and multifaceted nature of a company's or product's performance and customer satisfaction. the arrangement and overlap of the circles give a comprehensive perspective on how different factors interrelate, highlighting areas where improvement is required and areas that might be perceived as waste or inefficiency. the entire diagram serves as a visualization tool for understanding how interrelated these parameters are in the pursuit of overall customer satisfaction. the second image depicts a bivariate correlation analysis chart focused on identifying the influence of two independent variables on a dependent variable, specifically overall satisfaction. this chart is crucial for understanding how certain factors relate to customer satisfaction levels and how they interact within each other. in the center of the overlap between the two circles is a section labeled \"key success factors\" in a red rectangular area, indicating where the interaction of the two independent factors is positively correlated with the dependent variable. this area likely signifies the sectors where both factors contribute positively to the satisfaction score. encircling the \"key success factors\" are two semi-transparent circles intersecting at different points, each section labeled: the upper-left section surrounding \"key success factors\" is labeled \"indifference\" (green color), suggesting areas that have little to no correlation with satisfaction. the lower-left section is labeled \"waste/inefficiency\" (gray color), indicating areas contributing negatively to overall satisfaction. the lower right is labeled \"critical areas of improvement\" (salmon-colored), indicating sectors that have strong negative correlations with satisfaction. at the border where the two circles intersect outside the key success factors are two areas of interest: the upper-right section adjacent to the key success factors and labeled \"prerequisites\" (light blue), highlighting important foundational factors that influence satisfaction. the lower-right section at the intersection outside the areas of improvement and labeled \"strength points\" (pink), showing aspects that contribute positively but are not found within the key success factors alone. each section of the circles is distinctly delineated with specific labels that make it easier to understand the relationships between different areas of influence on customer satisfaction. overall, this visual representation encapsulates the varying levels of influence different factors have on satisfaction, creating a comprehensive and analytical overview of the correlation between the factors.", "type": "Document"}}
