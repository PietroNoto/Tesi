62 intra-oral scanner to take digital impressions chairside milling unit the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. by considering the whole sample, the left sided charts highlight that the chairside milling unit growth is flat, while the intra-oral scanner owners have increased from 8% to 13% (more than 60%). thanks to the flash equipment italy (based on real sell-out figures), it is possible to validate this information, as the moving annual total growth between the periods 2015-2018 confirms a noticeable increase of intra- oral scanner units sold. base: 281 cases (whole sample) clinic the image shows a bar chart titled \"do you have the following equipment in your practice?\" and compares survey responses from two different years: 2015 and the chart consists of two sets of bars representing the responses to each of two different questions: 1. \"intra-oral scanner to take digital impressions\" 2. \"chairside milling unit\" for each question, two bars are presented, one for the year 2015 and one for the year each bar is further divided into two segments: the dark blue segment represents the percentage of respondents who answered \"yes,\" and the light blue segment represents the percentage of respondents who answered \"no.\" in 2015, 92% (dark blue) and 8% (light blue) of respondents had an intra-oral scanner to take digital impressions, while in 2018, the figures were 87% (dark blue) and 13% (light blue), indicating an increase over the observed period. in terms of chairside milling units, in 2015, 95% (dark blue) and 5% (light blue) had the mills, whereas by 2018, these figures dropped to 95% (dark blue) and 5% (light blue), maintaining a flat growth trend compared to the increase seen in intra-oral scanners. each bar is annotated with specific percentages, which are clearly labeled, making it easy to discern the changes over the three years. the right side of the first image, above the bar chart, contains textual commentary summarizing the overall trend shown in the chart. it suggests that intra-oral scanner usage has increased over the three years while the chairside milling unit usage has remained stable. the footnote clarifies that any difference of +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. the bottom of the image notes that the data is based on 281 cases (the whole sample). the image contains two bar graphs placed side by side within a larger context involving detailed text and statistics. on the left, the text states \"omnivision digital\" and below are the details of the first bar graph. the first bar graph represents the percentage of digital technology owners who have certain equipment from 2015 to 2018 based on a sample of 281 cases. there are two specific categories represented: \"chairside milling unit\" and \"intra-oral scanner to take digital impressions.\" for each year, two colored segments are used where dark blue represents 'yes,' indicating possession of the equipment, and purple represents 'no,' indicating non-possession. for both the \"chairside milling unit\" and \"intra-oral scanner to take digital impressions\" categories: in 2015, 92% of respondents have the chairside milling unit, and 8% have the intra-oral scanner. by 2018, these numbers have shifted to 87% for the chairside milling unit and 13% for the intra-oral scanner. the accompanying text notes that the differences below +/ 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. it also recognizes the source of the sell-out figures, \"thanks to the flash equipment italy,\" and notes that the moving annual total growth between these years shows a significant increase in intra-oral scanner units sold. the second image, on the right side of the first image, visually simplifies this data with two larger horizontal bar graphs. both graphs have blue bars, representing \"no\" with a percentage of 95%, indicating that out of the whole sample, 95% of the respondents do not have the respective digital technologies being analyzed. the smaller grey bar is 5%, indicating \"yes,\" meaning 5% have them in their practices. the bottom of the graphs include text stating, \"yes\" alongside \"no\" to clarify which percentage each color represents. overall, the entire image emphasizes the trend of digital technology adoption among dental or orthodontic professionals as indicated by a significant increase in intra-oral scanning devices over the three-year period. it compares this with the consistent high percentage of respondents who did not have these technologies.", "type": "Document"}}
