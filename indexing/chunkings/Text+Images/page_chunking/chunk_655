1,63 labo 38 spontaneous awareness (unaided): it represents the entire group of brands of a certain product family, recalled by the interviewed sample. within the boundaries of spontaneous awareness, the consumer reasonably decides to make a purchase. top of mind: it represents the number of times a certain brand was mentioned as the first one by a respondent. 3shape, dentsply sirona and zirkonzahn confirm their leadership, but new competitors are growing, such as amann girrbach, roland, nobil metal and open technologies. this is even more evident when the top of mind is analysed: a relevant number of companies are increasing their top of mind score. unaided awareness top of mind the image contains a section titled \"digital equipment brands: unaided awareness\" with two primary charts comparing \"unaided awareness\" and \"top of mind\" for different digital equipment brands. under the header \"unaided awareness,\" there are two stacked horizontal bars for each brand, each divided into two sections of colors representing different years (red typically representing 2015 and blue representing 2018). the bars indicate the percentage of respondents who are aware of each brand. for example, \"3shape\" shows 21% (2015) versus 35% (2018) for unaided awareness. other brands similarly show varying degrees of awareness over these years. these bars provide a visual comparison of brand awareness over time. adjacent to the \"unaided awareness\" chart is the \"top of mind\" chart, which uses the same color scheme but represents the percentage of times a brand was the first that came to mind, labeled as \"% unaided.\" similar stacked horizontal bars are used for each brand over the two years. the top segment of the image introduces the concepts of \"spontaneous awareness (unaided)\" and \"top of mind,\" defining these as the percentage of times a brand comes to mind without prompting by the interviewer. the \"3shape, dentsply sirona and zirkonzhn confirm their leadership, but new competitors are growing.\" it also notes an \"overlap index: 1,39\" for unaided and \"1,63\" for top of mind in this part discusses the overlap and competition dynamics within various brands. in smaller text, the image mentions trends and specifics for particular brands like \"amann girrbach, roland, nobil metal and open technolgies,\" emphasizing points like \"the top of mind is analysed: a relevant number of companies are increasing their top of mind score.\" overall, the image offers a detailed comparative analysis of brand familiarity and top-of-mind recall for digital equipment brands within a specific market context. the design effectively utilizes visual bar charts to compare data across two years, illustrating brand trends and their impact. the image contains a comprehensive bar graph divided into two main categories: unaided awareness and top of mind. this is a visual representation of comparative market survey data, likely from a study conducted by key-stone analysis. the graph is color-coded with blue bars representing unaided awareness and red bars indicating top of mind recollections. for unaided awareness: 1. **3shape**: the blue bar is the longest, reaching 21%, indicating a high level of recognition without any prompts from the respondent. 2. **dentsply sirona**: a slightly higher percentage of 28%. 3. **zirkonzahn**: this brand is noted at 23%, indicating strong awareness. 4. **dental wings**: 14% awareness. 5. **roland**: the awareness is recorded at 11%. 6. **nobil metal**: the brand has a 11% recognition rate. 7. **open technologies**: awareness is recorded at 10%. 8. **amann girrbach**: 7% recognition. 9. **exocad**: this brand shows a lower awareness percentage at 5%. 10. **ivoclar vivadent**: this brand is recognized by 4% of the respondents. 11. **kavo**: only 3% awareness. 12. **wieland**: the brand shows a 2% recognition rate. 13. **3m**: it is recognized by both 2% of the respondents. 14. **egsolution**: this brand has a minimal 2% awareness. for top of mind: 1. **3shape**: this brand tops with 35% being the first brand mentioned by respondents, and a 26% unaided awareness rate. 2. **dentsply sirona**: 18% top of mind, with 8% unaided awareness. 3. **zirkonzahn**: the top of mind rate is 12%, and unaided awareness recorded at 12%. 4. **dental wings**: it is mentioned first by 4% of the respondents, making it a potential top choice with 4% unaided recognition. 5. **roland**: it is the first choice for 3% of the group, and awareness is at 3%. 6. **nobil metal**: top of mind for 4%, with unaided awareness at 1%. 7. **open technologies**: 4% top of mind choice with a 2% recognition level. 8. **amann girrbach**: it is the first pick for 1% of the group, showing low unaided awareness. 9. **exocad**: 2% top of mind, but barely recognized without aids at only 1%. 10. **ivoclar vivadent**: 4% of the population chose this brand first, but only had a 4% unaided awareness level. 11. **kavo**: only 3% picked it as the first brand, and an awareness rate of 2%. 12. **wieland**: chosen by 1% of the respondents with no significant unaided awareness. 13. **3m** and **egsolution**: both are chosen by 1%, and not widely recognized without aid, with 2% recognition. additionally, there are two sections discussing \"spontaneous awareness (unaided)\" and \"top of mind,\" providing context for the bars. spontaneous awareness refers to brand recognition as a certain product family by the interviewees. it explains that within the bounds of spontaneous awareness, the consumer decides to make a purchase. the image also provides a trend analysis and a note about the overlap index (1.39) along with a comparison of the year 2018 versus however, specific details on the overlap index and the years are not filled out, thus requiring further verification. an analysis of the overlap index indicates an analysis regarding brand leadership within the dental equipment market. overall, the image offers detailed insights into the awareness and preference of digital equipment brands, reflecting a snapshot of market dynamics at a specific point in time.", "type":
