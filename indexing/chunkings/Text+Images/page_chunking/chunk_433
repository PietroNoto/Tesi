the segments are: orange (3%) and yellow (2%) for fully disagree and partially disagree, respectively; blue (26%) and dark blue (20%) for partially agree and fully agree, respectively. the second statement: the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase - the segments are: orange (4%) and yellow (4%) for fully disagree and neutrality, respectively; blue (30%) and dark blue (23%) for partially agree and fully agree, respectively. the third statement: the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks - the segments are: orange (18%) and yellow (14%) for fully disagree and partially disagree, respectively; blue (27%) and dark blue (21%) for partially agree and fully agree, respectively. additionally, this sub-section of the infographic includes two data trend analysis sections along the right side: at the top section, it shows the percentage (as 'agree') for the year 2018, followed by 2015 (with the color key specifying different agreement levels). the lower section has similar trend analysis but is not explicitly dated for the year. to the right, a graph is plotted illustrating the data comparison with a line connecting the years 2018 and 2015 for the percentage of agree responses. each segment in the bar chart, along with the percentage scale, provides specific insights into the distribution of responses, allowing readers to understand the balance between the degree of agreement and disagreement regarding the statements presented. the 3d bar segmentations help in visualizing the distribution effectively, making it easier to infer trends in public sentiment over time. the image contains a section of a study analyzing the main consequences in dentistry brought about by 3d printing, focusing on three key areas: the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden, the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase, and the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of materials compared to cad-cam blocks. the study is based on an analysis of 588 cases. the analysis is visually represented through horizontal bar graphs comparing data from two years, 2018, and 2015 (indicated as 'v. 2018 (agree)' and 'v. 2015 (yes)'), and it includes a trend analysis line graph showing the percentage of respondents (named agree) over the years. the bar graphs include responses measured from \"fully disagree\" to \"fully agree,\" which are visually represented with different colors and their corresponding percentages. specific details of the agreement rate for each statement are as follows: 1. **kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden**: - in 2018, 26% fully agreed, 20% partially agreed, and 52% neutral. - in 2015, 34% fully agreed, 23% partially agreed, and 43% neutral. 2. **the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase**: - in 2018, 4% fully agreed and 30% partially agreed. - in 2015, 4% fully agreed and 30% partially agreed. 3. **the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks**: - in 2018, 18% fully agreed and 39% partially agreed. - in 2015, 21% fully agreed. the trend analysis line graph tracks the percentage of respondents agreeing from 2015 to 2018, showing a general decrease in the percentage of respondents agreeing by that metric. additionally, this section is part of a larger study report, indicated by a citation at the bottom that reads \"base: 588 cases (whole sample).\" the image is marked with page number 31 in the lower-right corner and contains the logos of omnivision and key-stone, suggesting the organizations associated with the study or the graphical representation. the image contains a visual representation of data, titled \"main consequences in dentistry brought by 3d printing.\" it is a graphical analysis focusing on the opinions of respondents regarding the impact of 3d printing on dental practices. the graphic elements include a chart and a line chart with specific numerical data and trend analysis. *charts description and data:** 1. **chart with four sections:** - **the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden:** - fully agree (red bar): 5% - partially agree (yellow bar): 52% - neutral (blue bar): 26% - partially disagree (light blue bar): 2% - fully disagree (grey bar): 9% - **the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase:** - fully agree (red bar): 4% - partially agree (yellow bar): 46% - neutral (blue bar): 23% - partially disagree (light blue bar): 4% - fully disagree (grey bar): 23% - **the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks:** - fully agree (red bar): 18% - partially agree (yellow bar): 15% - neutral (blue bar): 14% - partially disagree (light blue bar): 20% - fully disagree (grey bar): 13% 2. **trend analysis:** - data values shown as \"percentage of 'agree'\" over two years: - in 2018, the percentage of respondents who agree with each statement was 72%, 70%, and 68% for the three statements respectively. - in 2015, the same data points were 82%, 73%, and 57% for the three statements respectively. - a line chart indicates that there is a noticeable downward trend over the years for the percentage of respondents who agree with the statements. 3. **legend:** - represented colors for different responses: - red: fully agree - yellow: partially agree - blue: neutral - light blue: partially disagree - grey: fully disagree *overall insight:** - the data is indicating a substantial shift in the perception of 3d printing's impact on dental procedures over the given time periods. - a clear decline in the number of respondents who strongly agree with statements about the broadening of materials and increasing efficiency can be observed. *background knowledge:** - 3d printing, or additive manufacturing, has been extensively integrated into the dental industry to streamline the production of dental implants, prosthetics, and other dental models. by enabling quick, customized, and economical production, it has revolutionized the workflow and material usage in dental practices. - the broadening of materials and procedures (as implied by \"the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden\") suggests that dentists can now manufacture a range of materials and components not previously accessible or cost-effective to fabricate within traditional methods, like cad-cam (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing). *technical terms and terminology used:** - **cad-cam (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing):** a process used in dentistry for designing and producing dental restorations and prosthetics. - **line chart and trend analysis:** illustrates the relationship between variables, helping visualize changes over time and make data-driven decisions. *visual elements:** - bars representing data distributions in proportions (red to grey). - a numerical breakdown for precise understanding. - a line graph representing long-term trends. *relevance of data presented:** - this analytical chart likely originates from a survey or study, providing insights into how professionals in the dental field are adapting to the advent of 3d printing technology, focusing on its impact on material flexibility, efficiency, and cost efficiency.", "type": "Document"}}
