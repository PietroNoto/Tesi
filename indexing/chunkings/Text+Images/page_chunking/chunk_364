the bar shows that 43% of respondents believecad-cam technology will play a significant role in the future, 41% think it will influence a limited part, 16% feel it will be less relevant, and 6% are unsure. 2. **from 31 to 60:** - 48% of respondents believe the technology will play a significant role, 48% think it will affect a limited part, 23% feel it will be less relevant, and 10% have no opinion on this category. 3. **more than 60:** - 52% of respondents think cad-cam will play a significant role, 49% believe it will affect a limited part, 18% feel it will be less relevant, and 11% are undecided. 4. **up to 40:** - 45% of respondents see cad-cam technology as significant, 44% think it will influence in a limited manner, 13% feel it will lessen its impact, and 12% have no opinion. 5. **from 40 to 50:** - 52% of respondents believe cad-cam will be significant, 52% indicate it will affect a limited part, 5% feel it will be less relevant, and 13% are unsure. 6. **more than 50:** - 38% believe cad-cam will be significant, 24% think it will influence in a limited manner, 18% feel it will lessen its impact, and 10% have no opinion. 7. **up to rs 9,000:** - 52% believe cad-cam will be significant, 52% think it will affect in a limited way, 5% feel it will lessen its impact, and 11% are undecided. 8. **more than rs 9,000:** - 55% believe it will be significant, 44% think it will influence a limited part, 20% think it will be less relevant, and 10% are unsure. 9. **up to rs 17,001:** -
