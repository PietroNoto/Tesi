(scores from 0 extremely unlikely to 10 extremely likely) it is interesting to note that, according to the literature, generally speaking, the nps value should be above 20 to be considered satisfactory. certainly this value may differ according to the market segment under analysis, but its just interesting to note that the highest nps score in this case is 13 by amann girrbach. it is also worth to compare the spanish results from italy, where the values of the leading brands were all above the possible answers have been further clustered. the clustering is the following: detractor: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 0 to neutral: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to advocate: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 9 to 10. 85 the image contains a single bar chart titled \"net promoter score: main brands\". it represents the likelihood, on a scale from 0 to 10, that respondents would recommend various cad-cam company brands to a colleague. the overall net promoter score (nps) for all brands is indicated, along with separate sub-grouping scores for open technologies and amann girrbach. each data point consists of a percentage score in a colored box, and the overall mean and nps value are displayed alongside these scores. this chart is detailed with the following specific scores: for the open technologies brand: 42% are detractors (red), 22% are neutral (yellow), and 36% are advocates (blue). the overall mean for open technologies is shown as a cyan horizontal line with a value of 6.5, and n.p.s. is marked at -6%. for the amann girrbach brand: 33% are detractors, 20% are neutral, and 47% are advocates. the overall mean for amann girrbach is depicted as a cyan horizontal line with a value of 6.9, and n.p.s. is marked at 4%. these scores are further clustered into detractors, neutral, and advocates categories, shown in red, yellow, and blue, respectively, on the right side of the chart. the chart demonstrates a negative n.p.s. for both open technologies and amann girrbach, indicating lower likelihoods for recommendations. the presence of the n.p.s. marker and the overall means provide an indication of how these brands are perceived by customer respondents concerning their likelihood to recommend these brands to their colleagues. the image contains a bar chart presented on a page with additional graphic elements, annotations, and descriptive notes placed above and below it. the specific components included in the image are: 1. **bar chart**: - the bar chart consists of four sets of bar groups, each corresponding to a different brand or product category. the categories are labeled at the top of each group, with \"overall\" being the most prominent one. - for each category, the chart includes three bars side by side, each representing a different scoring category: an orange bar labeled \"detractor\" representing negative sentiments or dissatisfaction. a yellow bar labeled \"neutral\" representing neutral sentiments or mixed feedback. a blue bar labeled \"advocate\" representing positive endorsements or satisfaction. - each brand/category pair has its own bar group, displaying the percentage proportions for each of the three categories. - across all groups, the orange \"detractor\" bars typically have the smallest proportions, while the blue \"advocate\" bars have the largest proportions. 2. **additional elements**: - **nps score (net promoter score)**: positioned as an inset on the top right of the image, the nps score has numerical values (e.g., 6.5, 7.2, etc.) for each brand/category pair, accompanied by a note stating the average value of the scores grouped into three clusters. - **cluster groups**: - the nps score inset explains these three clusters: - 0 to 6 (detractor) - 7 to 8 (neutral) - 9 to 10 (advocate) - each cluster is represented by a specific color (red for detractor, green for neutral, and blue for advocate), matching the color coding used in the bar chart. 3. **notes and labels**: - there is an explanatory note below the overall score that outlines the average nps values based on different market segments and provides a comparative benchmark for understanding the company's performance. a comparison to the spanish results is included within this context. overall, this second image offers a detailed visualization of consumer sentiment or customer endorsement across four branded entities, categorized by their performance or acceptance in different market segments. the annotations provide context and deeper insights for interpreting the data. the image contains a bar chart titled \"net promoter score: main brands.\" this chart categorizes the net promoter scores for various well-known brands, segmented by different customer responses: **detractor**: these bars are colored in orange and represent the percentage of respondents who would recommend each brand not at all or somewhat not. the bar for detractor responses shows the likelihood of customers not recommending brands like \"overall,\" \"open technologies,\" \"amannirrbach,\" and \"3shape.\" **neutral**: these bars are colored in yellow and represent respondents with neutral opinions who would not advise against the brand, but they also wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend it. **advocate**: these bars are colored in blue, representing customers that would enthusiastically recommend the brand to their colleagues. the mean net promoter score (nps) is indicated by a vertical line and numerical values for each brand, demonstrating an overall preference for the brands in the context of promotional behaviors. for instance, \"amannirrbach\" has a higher nps score with a positive response indicator, implying higher likelihood of customer advocacy. additionally, nps values are annotated for each brand beside the bars. the textual context given in the main article states further clustering, differentiating neutral, detractor, and advocate opinions, along with additional insights on the satisfaction of brand scores derived from diverse market segments. the second image is a standalone bar chart, likely extracted or referenced within the first image's context, summarizing the detractor segment for a deeper qualitative insight into consumer behavior towards specific brand recommendations.", "type": "Document"}}
