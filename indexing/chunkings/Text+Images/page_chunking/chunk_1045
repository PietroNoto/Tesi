difference from mean in your opinion, how do you rate the mentioned brands in the following areas? 59 3m (280 quotes) all brands (1.142 quotes) dentsply sirona (296 quotes) ivoclar (144 quotes) the image contains a list of survey responses in question format, similar in design to the bar chart shown in the upper section of image-1 with a specific brand name marked at the bottom right, which is likely the \"key-stone\" brand. the left side of the text is aligned vertically in small black lines, while the actual survey questions are presented horizontally and aligned to the right starting from the top to the bottom. the exact wording of each response option in the first image is not entirely clear in the cropped and blurry text but seems to correspond directly to the bars of the graph. the survey responses listed in the image are designed to capture customer sentiments, with statements such as: this company has a high reputation this company has products with the highest quality this company has a long-time tradition the products of this company are the easiest to use i trust this company more than others i think that it is the right company when i look for innovation i feel this company to be among the most customer-oriented ones i feel this company to be among the most familiar and friendly this company supports my business development more than others the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio the image itself, apart from the question list, has a red vertical bar indicating the score or value for each statement. these red bars seem to represent the relative strength of the sentiment expressed for that particular statement. due to the resolution and quality of the image, specific numerical values or exact scores on the bar graph are not clear and can only be approximated visually. in context of image-1, the responses in image 2 match the areas analyzed in the bar graph: the height of the red bar reflects the magnitude of the response to each question, likely showing how well or poorly the 'key-stone' brand performs against other entities ('all brands', '3m', 'dentsply sirona', 'ivoclar'). the negative scores in the red bars indicate generally unfavorable opinions compared with positive views represented in green. the image contains a bar chart titled \"brand image\". it is part of a study conducted by \"brandequity\" (noted in the lower-left corner), which indicates results from specific areas related to brand perception. the bar chart features various vertical bars, each representing the percentage of responses in different categories. the categories measured are based on statements such as the company's reputation, quality of products, ease of use, trustworthiness, innovativeness, customer orientation, friendliness, business development support, and value for price ratio. the green bars indicate positive values, while the red bars represent negative or unfavorable values. some notable aspects of the first bar chart include the following: a green bar at the top showing a 20% positive response. a green bar below that showing an 18% positive response. an immediate green bar below showing an 18% positive response. moving further down: - a green bar showing a 16% positive response followed by a -13% negative response. - red bar below with a -5% negative response. - another red bar with a -6% negative response. the second image, presumably a graphical component derived from the first example, is also a bar chart that closely resembles the first one. this specific bar chart is shorter, likely representing summarized or specific groupings derived from the data in the first image. it presents positive and negative responses in the same categories. in summary, the bar chart in the second image mirrors the data from the first bar chart, focusing on positive and negative responses in a simplified manner. the image contains a horizontal bar chart that focuses on customer perceptions regarding brand attributes. there are two distinct segments, colored green for favorable perceptions and red for unfavorable views, indicating the difference from the mean in percentages. at the top of the chart, three broad categories are listed in green bars: 1. **this company has a high reputation** - 16% 2. **this company has products with the highest quality** - 21% 3. **this company has a long-time tradition** - 23% these green bars represent areas where customer perceptions are above average (greater than the mean). following these, there is a gap of zero at -0% with no bars intersecting, implying neutral perception towards several attributes. additional green bar: 4. **the products of this company are the easiest to use** - 2% transitioning to the red section: **i trust this company more than others** - -18% **i think that it is the right company when i look for innovation** - -8% **i feel this company to be among the most customer-oriented ones** - -15% **i feel this company to be among the most familiar and friendly one** - -19% **this company supports my business development more than others** - -19% the red bars depict customer perceptions that are significantly below average, highlighting areas where customers have less confidence or positive emotions toward the company. the descending values underscore a general dissatisfaction with various customer-oriented and trust-based attributes. the bars are grouped under the header \"all brands (1.142 quotes) 3m (280) dentsply sirona (296) ivoclar (144),\" suggesting data aggregation from multiple sources or customers, with each set of bars representing the overall mean for different brand segments or customer groups. the layout and clear color distinction between positive and negative perceptions make the data easy to understand at a glance. the image contains a bar chart titled \"brand image: focus on 'totally relevant' - difference from mean. the chart is divided into four segments representing different data sets: \"all brands (1.142 quotes),\" \"3m (280 quotes),\" \"dentspply sirona (296 quotes),\" and \"ivolar (144 quotes).\" each segment provides a percentage breakdown of responses to the question \"in your opinion, how do you rate the mentioned brands in the following areas?\" with different colors distinguishing between positive (green) and negative (red) ratings. the chart has five dimensions listed on the left side: this company has a high reputation this company has products with the highest quality the company has a long-time tradition the products of this company are the easiest to use i trust this company more than others i think that it is the right company when i look for innovations i feel this company to be among the most customer-oriented ones i feel this company to be among the most familiar and friendly one this company supports my business development more than others the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio all categories except the tenth (top right) are represented by both green and red bars, indicating both positive and negative feedback. this tenth category includes only red bars, which indicates consistently lower ratings compared to the other groups highlighted below. the color-coded bars represent the percentage difference from the average feedback within each category. the green bars indicate values above the mean, while the red bars indicate values below the mean. key observations for each segment: for all brands, positive responses are high, ranging from 15% to 19%. notable negative responses are for 'i trust this company more than others' (1%), 'i think that it is the right company when i look for innovations' (3%), and 'i feel this company to be among the most familiar and friendly one' (3%). data for 3m shows a noticeable decline in positive responses for 'this company has products with the highest quality,' 'the products of this company are the easiest to use,' and 'this company supports my business development more than others,' highlighting a significant negative shift. dentspply sirona's responses are mixed with notable negative aspects, particularly in 'i think that it is the right company when i look for innovations' (5%) and consistently in the category 'this company supports my business development more than others' (15%). ivolar reports lower positive responses across the board, with more pronounced negative feedback especially for 'the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio' (14%), and a strong negative for 'i feel this company to be among the most familiar and friendly one' (15%). each segment's respective feedback emphasizes aspects where there might be challenges or opportunities for improvement. notably, trust and familiarity appear to be significant areas with both positive and negative assessments. the image shows a horizontal bar graph segmented into two halves, comparing customer perceptions across four brands and several categories. these categories are measured in percentage points relative to an unnamed benchmark or average. three brands (labelled as 3m, dentsply sirona, and ivoclar) are situated on the right side of the graph with the following metrics: - \"this company has a high reputation\" - 3m: 17%, dentsply sirona: 10%, ivoclar: 11%. - \"the products of this company are the easiest to use\" - 3m: 2%, dentsply sirona: 0%, ivoclar: 1%. four brands (labelled as all brands, 3m, dentsply sirona, and ivoclar) are situated on the left side of the graph: - \"this company has high quality products\" - all brands: 15%, 3m: 21%, dentsply sirona: 18%, ivoclar: 17%. - \"the products of this company are the easiest to use\" - all brands: 0%, 3m: -2%, dentsply sirona: -3%, ivoclar: -4%. each bar is color-coded with green indicating positive percentages and red indicating negative percentages. the bars in the middle represent negative deviations from a mean baseline, with the first three categories (high reputation, easy-to-use products) having green bars suggesting positive deviations above average, with 3m consistently ranking higher across these metrics. however, the \"products with the highest quality\" and \"easiest to use\" categories show negative percentages deviating below average, with the most notable negative impact being a substantial -15% for ivoclar, which indicates a significant drop below par in perception for product quality. in the graphical representation, numerical values for each item are directly placed next to the bars, making quantitative comparison straightforward. this segment of the bar graph effectively visualizes the relative standing of different brands with regard to the mentioned attributes, aiding in quick assessment of brand performance against the specified benchmarks.", "type": "Document"}}
