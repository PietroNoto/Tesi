excluding specialized orthodontics practices. 63 base: 498 cases non owners random sample the buying intention certainly yes of 5% is reduced to 4.5% including orthodontists. for respondents who claimed not to have a cad-cam equipment in their office, their future purchase intention was consulted. on the other hand, practices that already have 2 or more chairs are inclined to be more disposed to purchase. between clusters related to the patient's social class, the interest is predominantly averse, with the exception of practices with customers of a and b classes, that in 50% of answers showed to be willing to acquire a cad-cam equipment the image contains a pie chart with four segments, each representing the buying intention of dental practitioners regarding the purchase of an intraoral scanner or cad-cam chairside milling unit within two years. the chart is divided into four responses: \"certainly no\" (dark blue), \"probably no\" (light blue), \"probably yes\" (blue), and \"certainly yes\" (gray). the largest segment is blue, representing 33% of respondents who indicate a \"probably yes\" buying intention. this signifies that nearly one-third of dental practitioners are highly likely to consider purchasing an intraoral scanner or cad-cam chairside milling unit within the next two years. the next significant segment is dark blue, representing 30% of respondents with a \"certainly no\" buying intention. this means that a substantial portion, roughly one in three, are decisively against buying such equipment in the timeframe. a portion of the chart is light blue, indicating that 32% of respondents have a \"probably no\" buying intention. this suggests uncertainty among dental practitioners but slightly more likely to lean towards not purchasing. lastly, a small segment is gray, representing 5% of the respondents who have a \"certainly yes\" buying intention. this is the smallest segment, implying caution among a very small percentage of dental practitioners who are certain about intending to buy such equipment. overall, the data highlights a significant but decisive split among dental practitioners when it comes to their future purchases of intraoral scanners and cad cam milling units, with a notable number leaning towards holding off, yet with a significant proportion indicating a strong intention to proceed. the image is a bar graph titled \"buying intention\" that represents data on dental practitioner respondents' future intentions regarding the purchase of intraoral scanners or cad-cam chairside milling units within the next two years, excluding specialized orthodontics practices. the horizontal axis of the graph is divided into three main categories: age of the practice owner: - up to 40 years - from 41 to 50 years - more than 50 years number of dental chairs: - 1 - 2 - 3 or more - 4 or more social class of patients: - high /mid-high class (a/b class) - middle class (c/d class) - lower class (e class) the vertical axis lists the level of buying intention in percentage, with the following segments: certainly no: 1-5% probably no: 5-20% probably yes: 20-40% certainly yes: 40-50% each category is represented by a combination of light blue and dark blue bars: light blue indicates the proportion of respondents' intention to \"probably yes\" or \"certainly yes\". dark blue indicates the proportion of respondents' intention to \"probably no\" or \"certainly no\". for each combination of categories listed along the horizontal axis, the relative buying intentions are displayed with specific percentage values. specific data includes: for the age group \"up to 40 years\", the \"probably yes\" or \"certainly yes\" intentions are relatively higher. in practices with \"more than 50 chairs\", the percentage of practitioners who plan to \"certainly yes\" or \"probably yes\" is generally higher. among different social classes, higher social class practices tend to show higher buying intentions towards intraoral scanners or cad-cam chairside milling units within the specified time frame. at the top of the image, there is a summary section indicating the reduction in buying intention including orthodontists, stating: \"the buying intention \"certainly yes\" of 5% is reduced to 4.5% including orthodontists.\" further, a pie chart to the left side of the above text provides a visual summary of those with \"certainly no\" intentions, making up 32%, \"probably no\" intentions constituting 33%, and a significant portion of responses indicating \"probably yes\" or \"certainly yes\". overall, the visual representation indicates a nuanced distribution of buying intentions across different demographics and contexts within the dental practice community.", "type": "Document"}}
