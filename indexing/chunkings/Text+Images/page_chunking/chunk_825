42% of respondents feel uncomfortable and relatively far from digital technologies. **france (fr)**: - 21% feel uncomfortable and relatively far from digital technologies. **uk (uk)**: - 6% feel uncomfortable and relatively far from digital technologies. **spain (sp)**: - 29% feel uncomfortable and relatively far from digital technologies. the remaining percentages in each corresponding country show respondents either beginning to get closer to digital technologies because they believe they are the future of prosthetics, actively using digital technologies due to necessity but being uncomfortable, actively using digital technologies without discomfort, or those who are uncertain or unsure about the stance. the image contains a set of four bar graphs arranged horizontally. each graph represents the responses of respondents in different countries to a survey regarding their stance towards digital technologies in prosthetics. the countries depicted are germany (de), france (fr), italy (it), spain (sp), and the united kingdom (uk). in each bar graph, three bar segments are color-coded and labeled: the first segment is blue and represents respondents who indicated that they are using digital technologies because they needed it, but are not comfortable with them. the second segment is a darker shade of blue and signifies respondents who currently use digital technologies and are comfortable with them. the third segment is light blue and represents those who consider digital technologies to be the future, hence are getting closer to them. to the right of each set of bars, there is a small gray-ish bar which depicts the percentage of respondents who do not know their stance regarding digital technologies. the percentages for each category differ across the countries: **germany (de)** - used digital technologies and feel comfortable: 17% - used digital technologies and are uncomfortable: 66% - consider digital technologies the future: 11% - don't know: 7% **france (fr)** - used digital technologies and feel comfortable: 51% - used digital technologies and are uncomfortable: 29% - consider digital technologies the future: 6% - don't know: 8% **italy (it)** - used digital technologies and feel comfortable: 45% - used digital technologies and are uncomfortable: 29% - consider digital technologies the future: 5% - don't know: 20% **spain (sp)** - used digital technologies and feel comfortable: 49% - used digital technologies and are uncomfortable: 21% - consider digital technologies the future: 6% - don't know: 22% **united kingdom (uk)** - used digital technologies and feel comfortable: 52% - used digital technologies and are uncomfortable: 19% - consider digital technologies the future: 1% - don't know: 28% below the bar graphs, a pie chart is also displayed, corresponding to the german (de) data from the first image on the page. the pie segments divide the respondents into: 66% (light blue): don't know their stance 29% (blue): using digital technologies but uncomfortable 21% (dark blue): using digital technologies and comfortable 6% (darkest blue): considering digital technologies as future and getting closer additionally, the first image offers a summary of the general survey results from 722 cases, highlighting trends in the adoption and comfort levels with digital technologies among dentists and technicians as they transition into new market realities. the image contains a summary list that provides a breakdown of respondents' comfort levels with digital technologies in the context of their stance towards them. this is detailed in four distinct response categories: 1. \"i feel uncomfortable and rather far from them\" - the section is represented by a dark blue square. 2. \"i am getting closer to them because i think they are the future of prosthetics\" - this part is depicted by a lighter blue square. 3. \"i am using digital technologies because i need, but i am not comfortable with it\" - this answer is highlighted in an even lighter shade of blue, signifying moderate comfort. 4. \"i am using digital technologies and i am comfortable with it\" - represented by a square with a different light blue shade, this category pertains to respondents who have complete confidence in their interaction with digital technologies. additionally, there is an option for \"don't know,\" represented by a grey square, but it is not present in the summary list provided for further analysis. this summary suggests a spectrum of attitudes ranging from comfort and confidence (dark blue to light blue) to reluctancy and unfamiliarity (grey). the categorical approach in this image allows for a quick visual assessment of how comfort with digital technologies varies across different groups, providing insight into the psychological and practical adaptations to this emerging technology within various fields, notably in the field of prosthetics mentioned in the first image.", "type": "Document"}}
