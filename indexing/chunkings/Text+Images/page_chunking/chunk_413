base: 371 (total sample) across countries, there are no significant differences except in spain, where it was found a higher rate of non-owners who are considering a purchase: among the prospects in spain, non-owners make up 50%. in italy, those who already own a scanner have a greater presence. the proportion of non-owners among prospects is much higher among those over 54 and in smaller dental practices. the prospects can be categorized into two groups: potential future owners (about 40% of the sample) who don't own a scanner, and current owners (about 60% of the sample) who wish to purchase additional scanners. previous and recent surveys confirm that among repurchasers, 80% plan to add more while 20% plan to substitute the current technology. however, in practices with two or more scanners, the focus shifts toward replacing older scanners. this trend is influenced by the size of the dental practice and the age of their initial scanners. those who already own ios represent a highly relevant and strategic segment 61% of respondents own an ios scanner owner prospects 39% of respondents are prospects non-owner prospects the image contains a pie chart titled \"io s ownership,\" which visually represents the categories of respondents under that heading. there are three primary sections within the pie chart, each representing a different aspect or group of respondents. the chart is segmented into shades of green and pink, clearly breaking down the data as follows: 1. **primary sector (50% of respondents)**: this is the largest section in the chart, shaded in pink. it signifies that 50% of the respondents fall under the category labeled 'io s ownership'. 2. **secondary sector (39% of respondents)**: this green segment represents the second-largest section. it indicates that 39% of the respondents are categorized here. 3. **tertiary sector (11% of respondents)**: the smallest green segment, representing 11% of the respondents. the chart also includes text labels at the bottom, clarifying that 16% of respondents are scanners, while 45% are owners of io scanners. overall, this pie chart succinctly quantifies the distribution of respondents' ownership and roles regarding scanners. the colors used enhance differentiation between the categories, making it easy to visually distinguish the proportions of each subset. the clear labeling at the bottom ensures that any viewer can quickly grasp the breakdown and context. the image contains three bar graphs side by side, arranged vertically, each representing data on \"prospective buyers from future and current owners\" as pertains to introral scanners and their demographics. from left to right, these graphs are labeled as \"country,\" \"age,\" and \"dental practice size.\" *country graph:** this bar graph displays country-wise data on ownership and intentions to purchase introral scanners. it includes four countries: **france**, **italy**, **spain**, and data combined for groups under the headings \"up to 44,\" \"from 45 to 54,\" \"over 54,\" \"up to 2 chairs,\" \"3 chairs,\" and \"more than 3 chairs.\" for 'france', the breakdown starts with \"no, but we plan to purchase one in the future\" at 48%, followed by 32% with \"yes, more than one and we have plans to purchase another,\" 16% with \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one,\" and 20% with \"no but have not indicated any future interest.\" 'italy' shows \"yes, more than one and we have plans to purchase another one\" at 52%, \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 36%, and \"no but have not indicated any future interest\" at 12%. spain reflects \"no but have not indicated any future interest\" at 49%, \"yes, more than one and we have plans to purchase another one\" at 36%, and \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 15%. for \"up to 44,\" \"from 45 to 54,\" \"over 54,\" \"up to 2 chairs,\" \"3 chairs,\" and \"more than 3 chairs,\" the percentages show varying degrees of interest and ownership. *age graph:** this bar graph depicts data across six age groups categorized as \"under 45\" and \"45 and above.\" for 'under 45,' it's split into \"no, but we have not indicated any future interest\" at 32%, \"yes, more than one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 50%, and \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 36%. for the age group \"from 45 to 54,\" the breakdown is similar with \"no but have not indicated any future interest\" at 46%, \"yes, more than one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 18%, and \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 18%. for 'over 54,' the percentages are \"no but have not indicated any future interest\" at 41%, \"yes, more than one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 12%, and \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 5%. *dental practice size graph:** this graph is segmented into three groups: \"up to 2 chairs,\" \"3 chairs,\" and \"over 3 chairs.\" for \"up to 2 chairs,\" the percentages reflect \"no but have not indicated any future interest\" at 52%, \"yes, more than one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 43%, and \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 27%. for the \"3 chairs\" category, the breakdown is \"no but have not indicated any future interest\" at 55%, \"yes, more than one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 18%, and \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 40%. in the \"over 3 chairs\" category, the percentages similarly show \"no but have not indicated any future interest\" at 40%, \"yes, more than one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 43%, and \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 17%. the second image effectively shows varying patterns and trends in the willingness of different demographics to purchase introral scanners with distinct preferences based on countries, age, and dental practice size.", "type": "Document"}}
