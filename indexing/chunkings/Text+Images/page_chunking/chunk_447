the slide begins with the question, \"how do you feel the new digital technologies (cad-cam and 3d printing) will affect the way the prosthetics is carried out in your country?\" - the introduction notes that the main difference between the digital restoration providers and the rest of the sample is the difference in the percentage regarding digital technologies that will completely replace traditional prosthetics. 2. **bar graph:** - a bar graph follows the introduction, detailing percentages across four categories: \"no,\" \"yes,\" \"digit. restaur. provider,\" \"partner lab,\" \"manu/milling center,\" and \"scanner.\" - the graph displays the following percentages: - **no digital impact:** - partner lab: 11% - manu/milling center: 12% - scanner: 37% - **yes, significant change:** - partner lab: 32% - manu/milling center: 55% - scanner: 51% - **digit. restaur. provider:** - partner lab: 5% - manu/milling center: 12% - scanner: 12% - the remaining percentage for each subcategory (32% for partner lab, 48% for manu/milling center, 43% for scanner) falls under the \"dont know\" category. - the legend color codes are used: - blue: digit. restaur. provider - grey: partner lab - dark grey: manu/milling center - black: scanner - white: dont know 3. **text:** - to the right of the bar graph, corresponding text explains each category: - **no digital impact:** they will not play an important role because digital technologies will affect a limited part of the prosthetics. - **yes, significant change:** they will play an important role but i feel the traditional prosthetics will continue to be relevant in the future. - **digit. restaur. provider:** digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics. - **don't know:** dont know. 4. **footer:** - at the bottom left corner, there are logos and text indicating the base for the analysis as 1000 cases. - the footer includes logos for omnivision digital and key-stone. the layout of the slide suggests a professional and analytical approach to presenting survey data, aiming to inform about the perspectives and expectations regarding digital advancements in prosthetics and their potential impacts on various sectors involved in the production and restoration of prosthetic devices. the image shows a pie chart from the first image, specifically highlighting a segment containing \"no\" for digital restorations provider and \"yes\" for the rest of the segments. this segment is located in a blue shaded area and is broken down into three parts: \"no\" (12%), \"yes\" (55%), \"partner lab\" (8%), \"manufacturing center\" (5%), and \"chairside milling\" (11%). the chart is based on a sample size of 1000 cases. the image contains a secondary view of the same pie chart and bar graph as found in the first image, presented side by side on the page from dii. this secondary arrangement further enhances the display and comprehension of the presented data. ### analysis of the content 1. **bar graph visualization**: the bar graph presents data divided by the role of digital restorative providers. - **digit restorative providers**: the category represented by the blue bars shows the following responses. - 55% respondents say digit restorative providers \"will not play an important role because digital technologies will affect a limited part of the prosthetics.\" - 50% respondents say digit restorative providers \"will play an important role but i feel the traditional prosthetics will continue to be relevant in the future.\" - 43% respondents say digit restorative providers \"digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics.\" - 12% respondents say digit restorative providers \"will not play an important role.\" 2. **the importance of channels**: - **partner lab**: - 40% respondents indicate that partner lab is \"yes\" in its importance regarding digital technologies in the context of prosthetics. - 40% indicate \"no.\" - **manufacturing/milling center**: - 33% respondents indicate \"yes.\" - 67% indicate \"no.\" - **scanner**: - 51% respondents indicate \"yes.\" - 49% indicate \"no.\" - **impression**: - 40% indicate \"yes.\" - 60% indicate \"no.\" - **chairside milling**: - 46% indicate \"yes.\" - 54% indicate \"no.\" ### context within the first image within the broader context of the first image, the pie chart is used to summarize the responses in a visual format as follows. most respondents (55%) feel that digit restorative providers will not play an important role (depicted in dark blue and light blue). a significant proportion (48%) believes digit restorative providers will play an important role but traditional methods will remain relevant (depicted in dark blue and light blue). 9% indicate that digital technologies will replace most traditional methods (depicted in dark blue). this arrangement within the page helps readers intuitively compare the categorized responses for further analysis. in summary, the repeated pie chart on the right side of the page allows for clear reference and emphasizes the distribution of responses by different channels and technologies, offering a comprehensive insight into perceptions on the future of prosthetics technology integration.", "type": "Document"}}
