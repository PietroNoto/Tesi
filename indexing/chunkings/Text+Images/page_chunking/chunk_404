represented in blue. a significant portion of survey respondents cited trust in the technology as the main reason for purchase, accounting for 36% of the respondents. 2. **save working time** - represented in green. this motivator is second in importance, being chosen by 30% of respondents. 3. **better precision of the results** - represented in orange. this is the third main reason, chosen by 26% of respondents. 4. **depend less upon the lab** - represented in red. 12% of respondents choose this option, indicating a push towards increased independence from laboratory assistance. 5. **be innovative** - represented in blue. although this category is visually smaller than the first, being 5% of respondents, it signifies innovation as another driving factor. 6. **reduce the production cost** - represented in a lighter blue-green shade. this option is chosen by 4% of respondents, showing an interest in cost savings. 7. **more comfort for the patient** - represented in a beige color. 3% of respondents cite patient comfort as a reason. 8. **colleagues' advice** - represented in a dark grey color. 2% of respondents found the advice of their colleagues significant. 9. **improve my practices image** - represented in a lighter grey color. 2% of respondents considered this option. 10. **tax incentive** - represented in a very light grey/beige color, chosen by only 1% of respondents, suggesting tax incentives were not a main factor. overall, the chart reveals that the primary motivators are trust in technology and saving working time, with significant portions of respondents also valuing better precision and reducing workload on the lab. innovative opportunities and patient comfort garner smaller chunks of attention. the image shows a list of reasons that are commonly cited as motivations for purchasing cad-cam equipment. the list is broken down into two categories: the main motivators and additional, secondary motivators. ### main motivators: 1. **trust in the technology:** customers seek assurance that the technology is reliable and effective. 2. **save working time:** the purchase is motivated by desires to streamline processes and reduce the time spent on manual tasks. 3. **better precision of the results:** customers hope for improved accuracy and quality from the new equipment. 4. **depend less upon the lab:** the desire to reduce reliance on external facilities or consultants. 5. **be innovative:** customers want to bring new techniques and capabilities to their work. ### additional motivators: 6. **reduce the production cost:** the goal of reducing the expense associated with manufacturing or other production processes. 7. **more comfort for the patient:** an emphasis on enhancing the patient experience, potentially suggesting a better environment or more personalized care. 8. **colleagues' advice:** suggestions or endorsements from peers or colleagues. 9. **improve my practice's image:** a desire to improve the reputation of their professional practice. 10. **tax incentive:** financial benefits associated with purchasing cad-cam equipment, such as tax rebates or deductions. ### notes: the topographical distribution of responses and trust indicates varying degrees of significance and personal prioritization. the data aggregated into four main areas (innovation, quality, productivity, and independence) highlight the practical importance of the technology in everyday professional life. moreover, the pie chart underscores this with specific percentages emphasizing aspects of motivation such as the innovation motive being particularly high among respondents. this dual representation allows for a nuanced understanding of different motivations driving cad-cam equipment purchases.", "type": "Document"}}
