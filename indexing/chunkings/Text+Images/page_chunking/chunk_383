29 random sample for both technologies is rather high the weight of dont know, and in the case of the chairside milling, also brands without cad-cam equipment are mentioned. the scanner seems to be a more competitive market with the co-leaders evenly performing in the mental basket for the choice of the equipment. base: 135 cases interested in purchasing chairside milling scanner the image contains a horizontal bar chart showcasing the market distribution of scanner technologies among dental professionals. the chart is labeled \"what scanner brands are you willing to purchase?\" and presents the data based on responses from 135 dental professionals who expressed an interest in purchasing equipment. the bar chart includes two main sections: the left side depicts a chart for chairside milling, and the right side depicts a chart for scanners. each category lists several brands along with their corresponding market share. for chairside milling, the brands and their respective percentages are displayed as follows: **sirona**: 49% **cad-cam**: 36% **3m**: 6% **carestream**: 5% **nobel biocare**: 2% **planmeca**: 2% **cadblu dental**: 2% **dental wings**: 2% **don't know, no answer**: 16% the chairside milling chart highlights that sirona is the leading brand, occupying almost half of the market share, and carestream and 3m are the next notable contenders. other brands hold smaller shares, and the large portion of respondents who were either unaware of their preference or declined to answer suggests that theres room for potential growth or change. for scanners, the brands and their market shares are displayed as follows: **sirona**: 20% **3shape**: 18% **carestream**: 10% **3m**: 8% **planmeca**: 2% **align technology**: 1% **nobel biocare**: 1% **cadblu dental**: 1% **dental wings**: 1% **don't know, no answer**: 40% the scanner chart indicates that sirona emerges as the dominant brand with a nearly one-fifth market share. 3shape is the runner-up, closely followed by carestream and 3m. brand planmeca holds the smallest slice of the pie, and most respondents are not sure which scanner brand to purchase or did not participate in the survey (indicated by 'don't know, no answer with the highest percentage). overall, both charts reveal that sirona holds a prominent lead in both categories, but the chairside milling market share is notably higher than that of scanners, indicating that chairside milling may be a more prevalent service or product segment within dental practices. for additional contextual understanding, based on the first image which seems to emphasize the importance of sirona in both chairside milling and scanners, it appears that sirona might offer comprehensive solutions or is seen as reliable for these equipment types among the surveyed dental professionals. the image contains a bar chart illustrating respondents' preferences towards chairside milling brands. the bar chart is a simplified representation from a larger set of statistical data, as seen in the first accompanying image, which contains a more comprehensive summary. the bar chart specifically highlights the preferences for chairside milling and intramural scanner brands. each bar represents a brand, and the length of the bar corresponds to the percentage of respondents who selected that brand. here are the details for each brand: 1. **sirona**: this brand holds a significant lead with 49% of respondents selecting it, making it the most preferred option for chairside milling. the bar for sirona is the longest, indicating a high level of confidence in this brand. 2. **3m**: next on the list, with 8% of respondents opting for 3m. the bar for 3m is shorter than that of sirona but significantly longer than the bars of other brands listed. 3. **nobel biocare**: this brand is chosen by 6% of respondents, the second-shortest bar on the chart after sirona. 4. **carestream**: this option has a comparatively smaller percentage of 4% of respondents, represented by the third-shortest bar, albeit longer than the \"dont know, no answer\" bar. 5. **dont know, no answer**: 33% of respondents chose this category, making it the most prevalent option among all others. the corresponding bar is the shortest. the overall message of the bar chart suggests that there is a substantial number of respondents who are unsure about which brand to choose for chairside milling, as represented by the \"don't know, no answer\" category. additionally, it aligns with the overall impression in the larger set of data that there is a notably high percentage of uncertainty among consumers in this particular market segment. the chart emphasizes the dominance of sirona in the preferred brand category but also highlights the competitive nature of the market given the relatively higher shares held by 3m and nobel biocare.", "type": "Document"}}
