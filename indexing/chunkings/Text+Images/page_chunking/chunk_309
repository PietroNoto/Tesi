both france (purple) and spain (pink) show consistent high usage over the points marked, with scores hovering close to 4. - italy (blue) starts with a lower score but increases incrementally but without as significant a peak. 2. **improving internal planning activities, orthodontic, surgical, and/or implant prosthesis:** - france and spain continue to rate the scanner favorably, with scores staying around 4. - italys score is slightly lower than the previous category but shows improvement with a peak closer to the earlier range but still not fully as high. 3. **communication tool with the patient:** - france maintains high scores, close to 4. - spain sees a significant rise after the initial point from around 3 to nearing 4. - italy initially has a score around 3, gradually increasing but stays below the other countries in this category. 4. **marketing tool that improves the practice:** - france continues high usage, similar to the previous categories. - spain starts lower but then reaches the highest scores, showing the scanner's notable utility here. - italy mirrors its performance from prior categories, staying around mid-range. ### analysis: france maintains a consistent, high level of perceived usefulness across all categories, showing it as a favored tool for multiple aspects of dental practice. spain shows a significant increase in usefulness over time for certain categories, indicating it may have greater adoption or increased awareness of the scanners applications. italy, while improving, remains relatively lower across all categories, suggesting either slower adoption or the scanners utility being felt more in specific areas as opposed to across-the-board effectiveness. overall, the graph visualizes the comparison between these three european countries, highlighting the versatility and perceived benefits of the intraoral scanner in different areas of dental and orthodontic practices. the image contains a chart illustrating the perceived usefulness of an intraoral scanner across various dental practice scenarios based on the feedback of dentists in four different countries: france, italy, spain, and an aggregate of the surveyed dentists' responses. the survey sample size is 371 respondents in total. the chart is partitioned into five rows, corresponding to different applications and purposes of the scanner: 1. **tool for optimizing times (from chairside operations to laboratory work):** - encompassing france (24%), italy (50%), spain (18%), andmean votefrom3.6to4.0. 2. **tool for improving clinical effectiveness, accuracy, and predictability of treatments:** - including france (18%), italy (24%), spain (50%),mean votefrom3.3to4.0. 3. **tool for improving internal planning activities, orthodontic, surgical, and/or implant prosthetics:** - with responses from france (15%), italy (24%), spain (51%),mean votefrom2.9to4.0. 4. **communication tool with the patient for improving compliance and relationship even after treatment:** - including france (14%), italy (46%), spain (30%),mean votefrom3.3to4.0. 5. **marketing tool that improves the practice:** - encompassing france (13%), italy (45%), spain (31%),mean votefrom3.3to3. each application category is further broken down into five response tiers, each represented by a bar that corresponds to each country's feedback, with the following color codes indicating each tier: indispensable (green) very useful (light green) quite useful (yellow) not very useful (red) useless (dark pink) additionally, the image utilizes a secondary bar graph that visually depicts the mean voting score (from 1 to 5) for each application across the four countries. this graph aids in quickly grasping the aggregated perception levels. a key observation is the general high level of perceived usefulness for the scanner, with nearly all applications garnering substantial percentages of \"indispensable\" and \"very useful\" feedback. the chart effectively communicates the utility of the scanner across different professional and practice-oriented perspectives.", "type": "Document"}}
