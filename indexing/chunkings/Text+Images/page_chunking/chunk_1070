indicating respondents who are highly confident that they will repurchase the same brand again. 2. **rather likely (orange)** - represents respondents who are somewhat confident in their likelihood to repurchase. 3. **rather unlikely (blue)** - suggesting respondents who are somewhat less likely to repurchase. 4. **extremely unlikely (dark blue)** - indicates those who are highly unlikely to repurchase the same brand. 5. **don't know, no answer (gray)** - corresponds to responses where the participant is unsure or did not provide an answer for the question. this structured legend aids in categorizing the respondents into various levels of brand loyalty potential, helping to more accurately analyze the overall loyalty of individuals towards cad-cam products from a large owner sample. the image contains a section of a page from \"the loyalty metrics\" report, specifically showing a part of the tables from two different loyalty surveys related to cad-cam equipment. the first table is the \"brand advocacy\" survey and the second table is the \"repurchase intention\" survey. 1. **brand advocacy survey**: - this section measures how likely users would recommend cad-cam products to a colleague based on their experience with three specific brands: - all users - chairside - scanner - the data is presented in percentages for different categories of respondents: - extremely likely: represented by dark blue, ranging from 16% to 17% for chairside. - likely: represented by blue, similar percentages for all users and chairside. - neutral: represented by yellow, showing a significant 37% for chairside. - no answer: represented by grey for all users. - the average percentage (b.a.s.) for each brand is shown on the right; chairside has a -9 b.a.s., all users a 24, and scanner a 14. 2. **repurchase intention survey**: - this section assesses how likely respondents would replace their current cad-cam system with the same brand if they needed to buy a new one: - each brand has a percentage likelihood of repurchase listed: - all users: 18%, 22%, 29%, 18% - chairside: 18%, 21%, 29%, 18% - scanner: 18%, 23%, 29%, 18% - similar to the brand advocacy section, it includes two rows of data for each brand with a mean value of 7.4 shown. in summary, the second image shows the detailed breakdown of how users feel about recommending and repurchasing cad-cam systems, comparing three brands: all users, chairside, and scanner. these surveys provide insights into the satisfaction and loyalty levels among customers using these products. the image shows a table that is divided into two sections. the left side of the table has the heading \"how likely are you to recommend the cad-cam products of the following companies to a colleague?\" the metrics of recommendation (brand advocacy) are presented. ### brand advocacy metrics for this metric, the table includes the following brands: **all users** **chairside** **scanner** each brand has corresponding bars that represent percentages ranging from \"16%\" to \"37%\" for different response categories: **extremely likely (10)** **rather likely (8-9)** **rather unlikely (6-7)** **extremely unlikely (1-5)** **don't know, no answer** each bar is differentiated by color: dark blue for \"extremely unlikely.\" medium blue for \"rather unlikely.\" orange for \"rather likely.\" light blue for \"extremely likely.\" grey for \"don't know, no answer.\" the overall mean (7.5) and base advocacy score (b.a.s) of -13% are also highlighted beneath these metrics. to the right of the brand advocacy metrics, the table is divided into two sections. the upper portion is titled \"repurchase intent.\" ### repurchase intent metrics this metric asks the question: \"if you were to replace your current cad-cam system, how likely are you to buy the same brand again?\" similarly, the response categories have corresponding colored bars (depending on the likelihood of repurchasing): ** definitely will purchase the same brand (10)** **probably will purchase the same brand (8-9)** **probably will not purchase the same brand (6-7)** **definitely will not purchase the same brand (1-5)** **don't know, no answer** each question (three different scenarios: - if the user were to replace the system today - in the future with the same cad-cam - in the future with a new cad-cam system) has bars in dark blue, medium blue, orange, and light blue for the different probabilities. underneath the repurchase intent metrics, the table also shows the mean value (7.4) and the associated scores. in the bottom left, there's a legend explaining the color codes used in the table, ranging from 10 (extremely likely) to 5 (extremely unlikely). this table is part of a larger compilation known as the \"overview sample\" at the bottom, indicating that the data comes from an interview of 172 participants. the company logo of key-stone is also visible at the bottom corner of the page.", "type": "Document"}}
