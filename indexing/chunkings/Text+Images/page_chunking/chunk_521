open technologies 92 (low) satisfaction score (high) (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) waste/inefficiency indifference strength points critical area for improvement the map is the visual result of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. the horizontal axis represents the weight of each item on the overall satisfaction, while the vertical axis shows the satisfaction rating of each item. at the top right of the map there are the items that are very correlated to the overall satisfaction and the respondents stated to be more than average satisfied. at the bottom right there are the items that are very correlated to the overall satisfaction, but with lower than average satisfaction scores. the start-up training, as seen in the overall analysis map, seems to be important in the construction of the satisfaction among open technologies users, while its satisfaction score looks to be very low indeed. the image, which appears to be an excerpt from a larger document or presentation slide from \"key-stone,\" contains a section titled \"correlation analysis map.\" this map is designed to visually represent the relationship between various elements in relation to overall satisfaction. the map employs a binary correlation system, indicated by red dots along the two axes: horizontal (labeled \"weight on overall satisfaction\") and vertical (\"satisfaction score\"). the map categorizes elements into different quadrants which are color-coded from \"strength points\" (high satisfaction), represented in orange, to \"critical area for improvement\" (low satisfaction), shown in red. the quadrants include: upper right (highest satisfaction indicated through orange) upper left showing \"strength points\" but with low satisfaction lower left showing \"strength points\" but with very low satisfaction lower right quadrant, where elements are critically under-satisfaction (red) ### the content of the quadrants: 1. **upper right quadrant (strength points, high satisfaction)**: - **makes daily practice easier**: the dot here suggests that this element highly satisfies users and is positively correlated with the overall satisfaction score. - **handliness / ease of use**: also shows high satisfaction. - **reliability**: this factor is under high satisfaction. - **accuracy and overall quality of the restorations**: another critical \"strength point.\" 2. **upper left quadrant (strength points but low satisfaction)**: - **compatibility with other brands**: high satisfaction, but with lower-than-average satisfaction scores. - **technical support from the company**: high satisfaction but lower overall satisfaction. 3. **lower left quadrant (strength points with very low satisfaction)**: - **business development support**: has high satisfaction but very low overall satisfaction scores. - **technical assistance in case of repair**: similar high satisfaction but very low satisfaction score. 4. **lower right quadrant (critical areas for improvement)**: - **company availability and flexibility**: moderate satisfaction but a strong indicator for improvement. - **overall running costs**: this element indicates a strong correlation to low satisfaction. - **productivity increase**: shows high user satisfaction but a low satisfaction score overall. ### analysis: **compatibility with other brands**: although highly satisfying, it is noted as a point of lesser importance in terms of overall satisfaction, suggesting that while users like it, it doesnt significantly influence the overall rating. **start-up training**: highlighted as a critical area on the left side of the map, emphasizing the importance of better training processes to enhance user satisfaction. **technical support**: high satisfaction but underserved in driving overall satisfaction, indicating that while users appreciate the support, it doesnt directly improve their total satisfaction. **business development support and technical assistance**: high satisfaction in the technical support and business support indicates quality in these services, but they dont contribute as much to the overall satisfaction, possibly indicating a need for better utilization or perception. **makes daily practice easier, handliness & quality**: all strong factors with high satisfaction scores, indicating that improvements in these areas would have a significant positive impact on overall satisfaction. ### conclusion of image description: in essence, the image illustrates the balance between high individual satisfaction levels for certain elements and the overall satisfaction of users, with an emphasis on critical areas requiring improvement such as start-up training, company availability and flexibility, and overall running costs.", "type": "Document"}}
