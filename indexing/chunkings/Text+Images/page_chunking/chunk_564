**2015: 201 cases** - the percentages are approximately divided among three categories: - \"no\" (blue color) - \"yes\" (light blue color) - \"there will not be any change at all\" (dark blue color) the chart indicates a significant portion (around 49% for \"no\" and 13% for \"yes\" along with small percentages around 8-11% for \"there will not be any change at all\"). **bar graphs (right side):** on the right side, there are seven vertical bar graphs depicting different outcomes for the future based on the responses to the same question asked in the pie chart. each graph corresponds to a specific outcome regarding the role of dentists and technicians in the future: 1. **no:** - 24% (blue bar) - 61% (light blue bar) 2. **yes:** - 21% (blue bar) - 64% (light blue bar) 3. **there will not be any change at all:** - 39% (blue bar) - 50% (light blue bar) - the bars are segmented and differentiated as follows: - **digital prosthesis providers:** - 6% (no) / 71% (no change) / 23% (yes) - **technology:** - 13% (no) / 15% (no change) / 72% (yes) - **manufacturing:** - 11% (no) / 11% (no change) / 78% (yes) - **intraoral scanning:** - 21% (no) / 22% (no change) / 57% (yes) - **digital technologies owners:** - 38% (no) / 38% (no change) / 24% (yes) below the visual statistics, a section mentions: the perception about the evolution of the roles of dentists and technicians is changed in comparison to year there is a note indicating a higher percentage of quotes related to the need for collaboration. a statement emphasizing the importance of digital technologies in changing the current perspectives on the roles of dentists and technicians. these statistics reflect the evolving relationship and responsibilities between dentists and technicians influenced by new digital technologies, highlighting a trend toward greater cooperation and a demand for increased expertise among dental practitioners. the overall page layout includes the omnivision (digital) logo in the bottom-left corner, the key-stone logo in the bottom-right corner, and textual analysis on the bottom part of the page, summarizing key takeaways from the statistics. the image contains a pie chart that is labeled with different sections, each representing a percentage of the whole. the pie chart is depicted in two shades of blue, with a larger section in a lighter blue and a smaller section in a darker blue. the larger blue section is marked with \"38%\" on a label, and the smaller section is marked with \"13%,\" with a transitioning area labeled \"49%.\" the layout of the pie chart is such that the larger percentage is adjacent to the smaller percentage, forming a continuous, curved boundary with the labeled \"49%\" between them. in the context of the first image that displays this pie chart, it outlines the percentage distribution of opinions across different categories related to dentists and technicians' roles with new digital technologies. the text explains that the perception of the evolution of their roles has changed compared to 2015, highlighting the growing importance of cooperation between dentists and technicians, especially when it comes to digital prostheses. the pie chart serves visually to illustrate the specific proportions of opinions held by respondents in the survey, depicting the distribution of responses in two major parts along with a section indicating lesser contributions. it complements the descriptive text by providing a visual representation of the data mentioned in the accompanying text. the image contains a bar chart titled \"role of dentists and technicians in the future:\" it presents data on the perception of the evolution of dentists' and technicians roles in comparison to the year the chart details responses categorized by industry sector: digital prostheses providers, technology, channel, digital technologies owners. this is part of a study measuring the perceived need for collaboration between dentists and technicians in their respective work scopes. each bar represents the percentage of respondents who believe that dentists' and technicians' roles will change across different sectors. the chart is divided into three categoriesyes, no, and specific sectors including scans, impressions, partner-lab, manufacturer, millennium center, intraoral scanner, and chairside milling unit. **digital prostheses providers**: - yes: 71% - no: 6% - specific: 22% (scans 24%, impressions 21%, partner-lab 39%) **technology**: - yes: 64% - no: 15% - specific: 22% (scans 39%, impressions 11%, partner-lab 50%) **channel**: - yes: 73% - no: 5% - specific: 25% (scans 23%, impressions 23%, partner-lab 29%, manufacturer 22%) **digital technologies owners**: - yes: 74% - no: 8% - specific: 21% (scans 22%, impressions 22%, partner-lab 23%, manufacturer 22%, intraoral scanner 39%, chairside milling unit 54%) additionally, there is a notable difference in the perception between these sectors, with digital technologies owners showing the highest percentage believing there will be changes (74%) and digital prostheses providers having 71%. the specific sectors indicate different points of potential need for collaboration between dentists and technicians. furthermore, the chart includes a note mentioning the significance of considering the differences between 2% in comparison to the year 2015, indicating a statistical relevance threshold. lastly, the study acknowledges the need for dentists to gain expertise in areas such as prosthetics and technicians to collaborate on the digital aspects of materials, aesthetics, and processing necessary for the evolving work environment.", "type": "Document"}}
