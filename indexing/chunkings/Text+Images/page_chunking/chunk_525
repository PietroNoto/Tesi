the pie chart shows three categories, each represented by a different color segment. - **70% (dark blue)**: a significant majority, represented by a large dark blue segment, indicate that digital technologies will not play an important role because digital technologies will affect a limited part of the prosthetics. - **23% (light blue)**: a moderately sized segment, represented by a light blue color, shows respondents believing that digital technologies will play an important role but also that traditional prosthetics will continue to be relevant in the future. - **7% (dark green)**: a small, dark green segment, signifies those who anticipate that digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics. - **1% (teal)**: another very small but noticeable segment, indicated by a light teal color, reflects respondents who are uncertain about the impact of digital technologies on traditional prosthetics (labelled as \"don't know\"). **survey categories:** - **full outsourcing user response (23%)**: indicates a significant, but smaller, portion of respondents seeing limited impact with digital technologies affecting traditional prosthetics. - **in-lab milling response (24%)**: reflects a similar sentiment with a slightly higher percentage, indicating that digital technologies will have a notable role but not replace traditional methods entirely. - **scanner response (29%)**: shows the largest response segment, emphasizing that digital technologies will affect a limited part of the prosthetics. - **partner lab response (20%)**: indicates a substantial number of respondents believing in a balanced role of digital technologies without replacement. - **manufacturer response (12%)**: a smaller response segment, with individuals feeling that digital technologies will play an important role but with traditional methods maintaining relevance. - **technology response (15%)**: smaller segment, showing expectations for both limited and significant impacts of digital technologies without dominant replacement of traditional methods. *contextual integration within the page:** considering this pie chart is within the broader context of a page detailing the impact of digital technologies in prosthetics, the pie chart data complements the overall theme. the pie chart directly reflects the key findings from the survey, indicating that the traditional roles of prosthetics providers will continue to be significant despite the adoption of new technologies. this visual tool serves to concisely communicate the diverse viewpoints on the integration of digital technologies in the prosthetics industry. overall, the pie chart effectively distils complex survey data into a comprehensible format, emphasizing the broad consensus that while digital technologies will have a role, they will not wholly replace traditional methods in the prosthetics industry. the image contains a bar graph titled 'scenario: role of digital technologies on prosthetics in the future.' it is part of a larger page that discusses how digital technologies in cad-cam and 3d printing will impact the future of prosthetics. the bar graph specifically breaks down responses to this question from a survey with 722 cases, each represented by bars corresponding to different sectors in the prosthetics industry digit. restor. provider, technology, and channel. the graph is divided vertically into three categories labeled 'digit. restor. provider,' 'technology,' and 'channel,' each representing different sectors such as no, yes, in-lab milling, scanner, full outsourcing, manufacturer, and partner lab. for 'digit. restor. provider,' the responses break down almost predictably: 23% no 24% yes 20% in-lab milling 19% scanner 43% full outsourcing 19% manufacturer 32% partner lab for 'technology,' the responses are consistent: 68% no 71% yes 76% in-lab milling 73% scanner 50% full outsourcing 74% manufacturer 61% partner lab finally, for 'channel,' the responses seem less impacted by technological presence: 61% no 74% yes 61% in-lab milling 61% scanner 50% full outsourcing 64% manufacturer 61% partner lab each response category includes additional contextual data shown in smaller bars under the main bar. these smaller bars are: 9% who will not play an important role because digital technologies will affect a limited part of the prosthetics. 68% who will play an important role but i feel the traditional prosthetics will continue to be relevant in the future. 23% digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics. 6% dont know.", "type": "Document"}}
