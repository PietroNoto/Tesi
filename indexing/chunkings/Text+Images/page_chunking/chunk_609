treatments are performed in your clinic overall? 8 the here shown overall mean values of the monthly production (among the surveyed sample), although they should be used as an indication only, allow to retrieve very useful data on the weight for some of the key treatments in the dental practices. by considering the performance heterogeneity in the surveyed countries (due to the average size of the centers and the characteristics of the demand for dental treatments), the following slide shows the breakdown by geographical area. please note, the indirect restorations (veneers, inlays and onlays), are not included in the new cases of fixed prosthetics. it should be noted that the used opinion poll approach, which does not include the responses of \"non clinic owners, is not totally representative of the actual stratification of the reference universe with regard to the type and size of the dental practices. therefore, this methodology does not allow for the projection of the mean values of the sample on the reference universe in order to assess the total market. 4,3 18,6 84,7 average 73,2 9,6 9,0 6,8 clinic although the focus of the research is the digital flow, in light of a possible integration of the use of technologies and the different restorative, prosthetic and orthodontic therapies, it has been decided to investigate the number of treatments carried out in the clinic regarding fillings/restoration, oral hygiene/scaling, fixed protheses, implants, veneers, inlays/onlays and professional whitening. base: 1.061 cases the image contains a chart that shows the breakdown of the average number of treatments per month across different categories compared to the overall mean values shown in the first image. the chart is categorized into four sub-categories: fillings/restorations, oral hygiene/scaling, new cases of fixed prosthesis, and implants. *fillings / restorations**: up to 25: 31% from 26 to 60: 32% more than 60: 37% *oral hygiene / scaling**: up to 25: 34% from 26 to 60: 32% more than 60: 34% *new cases of fixed prosthesis**: up to 25: 33% from 26 to 60: 32% more than 60: 35% *implants**: up to 25: 18% from 26 to 60: 26% more than 60: 34% the first chart in the first image provides a detailed overview of the total number of treatments performed monthly, broken down by categories, giving the average monthly production (84.7 for fillings / restorations and 73.2 for oral hygiene/scaling) for clinics overall. the second chart in the image correlates these averages with the specific frequency ranges of these treatments. the image contains a chart labeled \"new cases of fixed prostheses,\" which is an extraction from the larger infographic on the page, as seen in the first image. the chart is a horizontal bar graph that breaks down the data concerning the number of new cases involving fixed prostheses per month. the chart, specifically, focuses on the quantity of new fixed prosthesis cases conducted over different periods. the data is divided into three categories, each represented by a horizontal bar of different colors and lengths. 1. **less than 10 cases:** represented by a light blue bar, this category shows that 33% of the clinics reported a new number of fixed prosthesis cases falling below ten cases per month. 2. **from 10 to 19 cases:** represented by a dark blue bar, this category has a slightly shorter bar than the first one, indicating that 32% of clinics reported having new fixed prosthesis cases ranging between ten and nineteen cases per month. 3. **20 or more cases:** represented by the darkest blue bar, this category shows that 35% of clinics reported having at least twenty new fixed prosthesis cases per month. this category has the longest bar, signifying the highest percentage. each category is labeled with a corresponding color code and a percentage, making the distribution of new cases crystal clear. the use of gradient colors (light to dark blue) could indicate an increase in the number of cases from left to right. the overall color-coding scheme enhances visual comprehension, ensuring that readers can easily recognize and compare the quantities without confusion. the chart's conciseness and clarity provide a quick and impactful snapshot of the data, allowing for an easy comparison of the proportion of clinics experiencing new cases within different ranges. the image shows a bar chart that provides specific data on the distribution of different types of dentistry treatments performed monthly. this information is presented within the context of the larger content on the page, which appears to focus on dental procedures. the bar chart is designed to visualize the percentage of specific treatments (such as fillings/restorations, oral hygiene/scaling, implant, veneers, indirect inlays/onlays, and professional whitening) in various regions. *image content detailed:** 1. **header and title**: - the chart header indicates various types of dental treatments. - each treatment type has different categories represented by different colors: - white for less than 5 cases - light blue for a range from 5 to 10 cases - dark blue for more than 10 cases 2. **treatment types and categories**: - **implants**: - less than 5 cases: 18% - from 5 to 10 cases: 26% - more than 10 cases: 34% - additional category: 22% - **veneers**: - less than 5 cases: 32% - from 5 to 10 cases: 37% - more than 10 cases: 19% - additional category: 11% - **indirect inlays/onlays**: - less than 5 cases: 23% - from 5 to 10 cases: 25% - more than 10 cases: 27% - additional category: 24% - **professional whitening**: - less than 5 cases: 15% - from 5 to 10 cases: 46% - more than 10 cases: 23% - additional category: 17% 3. **legend**: - the charts legend at the bottom differentiates between treatment categories using specific color codes, clarifying which percentage falls into each category. 4. **footnote details**: - the footnote in the lower-right corner explains that the data involves the responses of non clinic owners, and emphasizes that the method used does not necessarily reflect the actual market stratification of dental practices. the sample size reference is provided as base: 1,061 cases. 5. **additional commentary**: - the right side of the image features a description that addresses performance heterogeneity across various countries, referencing the variability in the average size of dental clinics and the characteristics of their demands. overall, the image presents a structured approach to understanding the distribution and frequency of specific dental services performed monthly in clinical settings, with annotations that highlight the representativeness of the data and the methodological limitations.", "type": "Document"}}
