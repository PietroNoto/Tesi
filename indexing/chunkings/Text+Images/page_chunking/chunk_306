the blue portion represents the percentage of respondents who still use traditional impression materials (silicones, polyethers, etc.). this is the majority percentage in each chart. 2. **continued use post-adoption of optical technologies:** - the turquoise portion depicts those who suggest they will continue to use traditional materials, even if optical impressions become widely adopted. 3. **replacement by optical technologies:** - an even smaller green portion illustrates the percentage of respondents who expect traditional materials will be completely replaced by optical impressions. the data points provide insights into the usage of traditional impression materials by country: **france:** 49% continue traditional use, 11% will transition post-adoption, 41% expect complete replacement by optical. **germany:** 47% continue, 7% will transition, 46% expected complete replacement. **italy:** 53% continue, 8% will transition, 40% expect complete replacement. **spain:** 51% continue, 10% will transition, 39% expect complete replacement. **uk:** 49% continue, 20% will transition, 31% expect complete replacement. each bars split sections visually demonstrate this distribution, enabling a clear comparative analysis in terms of both current usage and future adoption trends among these countries regarding impression materials. the image contains text detailing the responses from various sources regarding the usage of traditional impression materials in dental practices, specifically focusing on the replacement or persistence of them by new optical impression technologies. the first image displayed is a compilation of bar graphs representing the responses from five different countries: france, germany, italy, spain, and the uk. the bars are color-coded to indicate the percentage of respondents who believe that traditional impression materials will either be entirely replaced, only used for specific indications and play a marginal role over time, or continue to be used for certain indications without being significantly diminished in importance. the bar graphs convey the following: **france**: 41% believe in total replacement, 49% believe they will only be used for certain indications and play a marginal role over time, and 10% believe they will continue to be used without significant decrease. **germany**: 46% believe they will only be used for certain indications and play a marginal role over time, 41% believe in total replacement, and 11% believe they will continue to be used. **italy**: 53% believe in total replacement, 41% believe they will only be used for certain indications and play a marginal role over time, and 6% believe they will continue to be used. **spain**: 51% believe they will only be used for certain indications over time, 37% believe in total replacement, and 12% believe they will continue to be used. **uk**: 40% believe in total replacement, 53% believe they will only be used for certain indications and play a marginal role over time, and 7% believe they will continue to be used. below the bar graphs, there is an analysis that highlights some interesting insights derived from the survey question: \"how will the use of precession impression materials like elastomers (a silicons, polyethers, etc.) evolve in your practice?\" a substantial majority (over 40%) of respondents still think that traditional impression materials will continue to be widely used in dental practices despite the growing trend towards digital solutions. only a minority (10%) anticipates full replacement of traditional materials by optical impressions. this suggests a mixed scenario in which traditional technologies might coexist with new digital technologies rather than being completely replaced. in the second image, these details and interpretations are summarized with three bullet points: 1. \"they will be completely replaced by optical impressions\" represented by the color green in the first image. 2. \"they will only be used for certain indications, and over time they will play a marginal role\" represented by the color teal in the first image. 3. \"we will continue to use them for certain indications, and they will not decrease significantly\" represented by the color dark blue in the first image. the overall message reinforced by both images is that while traditional impression materials are not being abandoned wholesale and are expected to maintain some relevance, changes towards optical impressions are anticipated in many dental practices.", "type": "Document"}}
