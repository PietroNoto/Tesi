represented by a bar extending to the left by 53%. - these products are identified as the most indispensable and essential by the majority of respondents. 2. **provisional materials**: - shown with a bar extending to 14%. - this category is considered fairly important but not as essential as composites. 3. **bonding systems**: - depicted by a bar reaching up to 10%. - bonding systems also play a significant role according to this subset of respondents. 4. **glass ionomers**: - indicated by a bar of 6% length. - this category includes products that enhance bonding, although less crucial overall when compared to the above. 5. **luting cements** (4%): - these products stabilize the relationship between adjacent dental components. the percentage is slightly higher than categories like restorative materials and others. 6. **filling materials** (4%): - used for the restoration and repair of dental structures. 7. **restorative materials** (2%): - signify the base or structural components necessary for dental restorations. 8. **impression materials** (2%): - these materials enable the creation of molds and are crucial in preparing for restorations. 9. **prosthetic products** (2%): - prosthesis-like products essential for reconstruction after tooth loss. 10. **retraction materials** (1%): - used for slight adjustments post-placements. 11. **prophylaxis products** (1%): - these are for cleaning teeth and maintaining oral hygiene. 12. **oral care products** (1%): - essential for the overall oral health but secondary in comparison. 13. **other** (2%): - miscellaneous categories not listed individually. 14. **don't know / no answer** (0%): - reflects respondents with complete data. this information suggests a high dependence on composites and provisional materials, demonstrating an emphasis on dental restoration methodologies and preparations. the distribution indicates a clear prioritization in dental practices for certain materials over others, with those in the 'don't know/no answer' category likely showing consistency or oversight in their selection of essential products. the image contains a detailed analysis of customer perceptions of different product lines from various countries, as revealed through brandequity's product associations study for voco. this image is part of a larger analysis which seems to involve multiple case studies considering the page number 33. ### detailed description: *title & introduction:** the title at the top reads, \"product associations: voco.\" this indicates a focus on the perception of voco's various product lines. below the title is a clarifying question: \"which product of the company [x] do you consider to be characteristic and indispensable for your practice?\" there is an explanation about the data source as \"base 22 cases.\" *main visual elements:** 1. **primary donut chart:** - this chart shows a strong association between voco's product brands and product families, clearly divided. - the majority, indicated by the larger blue segment, is marked as \"product brand,\" totaling 72%. - the smaller segment in light blue represents \"product family,\" making up 28%. 2. **detailed breakdowns:** - beneath the pie chart, two comprehensive tables are provided. these tables delve into similar data organized by product categories and product families for four different countries or regions: fr (france), it (italy), uk, and sp (spain). *france (fr) data:** **product brands:** - the highest percentage is allotted to composites, at 53%. - provisional materials follow, with 14%. - bonding systems and glass ionomers take up 10% and 6% respectively. - other categories like luting cements, filling materials, and others have percentages ranging from 2% to 4%. *italy (it) data:** composites, at 78%, lead here. provisional materials are at 11%, bonding systems and glass ionomers at 11% each. below them, several categories, including structural adhesives and others, have percentages as low as 2% or 1%. *united kingdom (uk) data:** composites rank highest again, followed by provisional materials. bonding systems at 30% and glass ionomers at 10%. categories like luting cements, filling materials, and restorative materials each have percentages between 5% and 10%. *spain (sp) data:** similar to france, composites are top with 40%. bonding systems at 25%, followed by provisional materials at 25%. categories like glass ionomers and others have varying percentages, mainly between 0-10%. *visual insights:** the charts and tables provide a clear and comparative visualization of how voco's products are perceived across different regions. consistently, composites are seen as voco's most distinctive feature, especially in france and italy. the pie chart gives a succinct, at-a-glance view of the dominant perception of voco's brand over its product family. the smaller tables offer the same data but broken down by country, facilitating a direct comparison and emphasizing that composite materials and provisional materials hold significant sway in different markets.", "type": "Document"}}
