19 the image contains a pie chart that indicates the percentage of respondent opinions regarding the usage of cad-cam elements for prosthesis on implants. the chart is positioned centrally against a light gray background. the pie chart consists of two segments primarily: a dark blue segment labeled \"yes\" taking up 92% of the pie, indicating that 92% of the respondents agree with the use of cad-cam elements for prosthesis on implants. a lighter blue segment labeled \"no\" making up 8% of the pie, representing the 8% of respondents who do not agree with this usage. additionally, the first image that contains this pie chart provides supplementary information. on the left, there is a pie chart with dark blue and light blue segments similar to the central chart. the dark blue segment in this secondary chart is labeled \"prosthesis on implants\" and stands out prominently at 92%. the light blue segment is labeled \"yes,\" confirming the same 92% agreement. the rest of the primary image features additional text: a bold question in the upper left corner, \"considering all elements produced with digital workflow (also full outsourcing), what percentage is produced for prosthesis on implants?\", highlighting the context of the survey. a bullet-pointed statement below the supplementary pie chart: \"92% of the interviewed laboratories (which produce prostheses with digital workflow) perform prosthesis on implants.\" below this, a second bullet point states: \"83% of cad-cam elements are produced for prosthesis on implants, the remaining 17% for traditional prosthesis.\" on the right side of the primary image, there is a third chart titled \"percentage of elements,\" which breaks down the usage of cad-cam elements for prosthesis on implants (83%) and elements for traditional prosthesis (17%). this visual clarifies how the elements are distributed amongst the two categories. the bottom right of the primary image includes additional pie charts and bar graphs summarizing the production share of cad-cam elements in the year 2018: \"elements produced with cad-cam 10,3 100,0%\" \"elements for prosthesis on implants 8,5 82,6%\" \"elements for traditional prosthesis 1,8 17,4%\" \"total (providers of cad-cam elements) 417\" lastly, there are logos in the bottom left and right corners of the page, and the number \"19\" at the bottom right corner, possibly indicating page number. the overall message conveyed through the combination of charts and text is that there is a broad agreement (92%) in using cad-cam elements for prosthesis on implants, with detailed breakdowns of production distribution. the image contains a pie chart detailing the production share of cad-cam elements for prostheses used in implant practices. specifically, it is derived from a slide presented in a broader context which provides additional details and explanations surrounding the percentages and elements of the chart. at the top of the image, the heading reads \"cad-cam elements for prostthesis on implants,\" followed by a query regarding the percentage of all elements produced with cad-cam (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing) technologies, as well as those produced for traditional prostheses. below this heading, there are two smaller pie charts, each addressing different aspects of the production share within the context of prostheses on implants. the pie chart on the left titled \"percentage of laboratories\" indicates the participation rates of various laboratories: a blue section labeled \"prosthesis on implants\" which comprises 92% of the chart, indicating the proportion of laboratories that produce prostheses for implants. a small sector in red labeled \"no\" with 8%, indicating laboratories that do not produce prostheses for implants. the pie chart on the right, titled \"percentage of elements,\" categorizes the elements of cad-cam production according to their intended use: a green triangle representing \"elements for prostheses on implants,\" making up 83% of the chart. a smaller green area labeled \"elements for traditional prostthesis,\" constituting 17% of the chart. below these pie charts, a summary provides further details: 92% of the interview laboratories (which produce prostheses with digital workflow) perform prostheses on implants. 83% of cad-cam elements are produced for prostheses on implants, with the remaining 17% for traditional prostheses. to the right of the pie charts, there is a table labeled \"cad-cam production share,\" with the following data presented in 2018: \"elements produced with cad-cam\" totaling 417. \"elements for prostheses on implants\" amounting to 10,300 out of a total of 416. \"elements for traditional prostheses\" amounted to the key takeaway from these combined datasets indicates a substantial reliance on cad-cam technologies in the production of prostheses for implant use within the surveyed laboratories.", "type": "Document"}}
