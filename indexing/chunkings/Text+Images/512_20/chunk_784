(scores from 0 extremely unlikely to 10 extremely likely) it is interesting to note that, according to the literature, generally speaking, the nps value should be above 20 to be considered satisfactory. certainly this value may differ according to the market segment under analysis, but its just interesting to note that the highest nps score in this case is 13 by amann girrbach. it is also worth to compare the spanish results from italy, where the values of the leading brands were all above the possible answers have been further clustered. the clustering is the following: detractor: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 0 to neutral: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to advocate: the scores grouped in this cluster", "type": "Document"}}
