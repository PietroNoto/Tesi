(sintering and milling technique) in-house base: 108 cases (milling units owners) percentage of elements labo 129 in-house production total processing in-house production definitive elements only in-house production: 21,2 elements per week the image contains a pie chart titled \"in-house production total processing.\" the chart is subdivided, with each segment representing the percentage share used for different materials. the pie chart is color-coded with different shades for each material. the largest segment of the pie chart depicts cobalt-chrome, accounting for 59% of the processing. titanium follows closely with 20%, then comes zirconia at 5%, ceramic glass at 3%, pmma acrylic materials at 5%, and wax at 2%. the chart is placed on a green background and is accompanied by a set of legends in a horizontal manner. each legend includes a color square paired with the corresponding material name: cobalt-chrome (dark green), titanium (yellow), zirconia (light green), ceramic glass (green), pmma acrylic materials (pink), and wax (grey). the base is described as 108 cases, with the statistics based on milling units owners, representing 2.1 elements per week. in the larger context of the first image, which includes additional charts and text references related", "type": "Document"}}
