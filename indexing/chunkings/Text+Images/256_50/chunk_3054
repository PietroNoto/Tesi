(sintering and milling technique) in-house base: 108 cases (milling units owners) percentage of elements labo 129 in-house production total processing in-house production definitive elements only in-house production: 21,2 elements per week the image contains a pie chart titled \"in-house production total processing.\" the chart is subdivided, with each segment representing the percentage share used for different materials. the pie chart is color-coded with different shades for each material. the largest segment of the pie chart depicts cobalt-chrome, accounting for 59% of the processing. titanium follows closely with 20%, then comes zirconia at 5%, ceramic glass at 3%, pmma acrylic materials at 5%, and wax at 2%. the chart is placed on", "type": "Document"}}
