(low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) the items on the upper right side of the map, very close one to each other, will be further investigated on the regression analysis, in order to evaluate their importance on the recommendation. the image contains a scatter plot used in correlation analysis. the scatter plot has circular clusters and annotations explaining the relationship and categorization of different product attributes related to brand image and recommendation. the horizontal axis is labeled \"weight on recommendation,\" which likely represents the relative importance of a factor in the recommendation process. the vertical axis is labeled \"items,\" which suggests the different product attributes being considered. the plot shows the following attributes: too expensive (indicating an attribute that is high cost to users). good price quality ratio (indicative of more competitive pricing). affordable (signifying cost-effectiveness for", "type": "Document"}}
