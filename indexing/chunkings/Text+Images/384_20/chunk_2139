(low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) the items on the upper right side of the map, very close one to each other, will be further investigated on the regression analysis, in order to evaluate their importance on the recommendation. the image contains a scatter plot used in correlation analysis. the scatter plot has circular clusters and annotations explaining the relationship and categorization of different product attributes related to brand image and recommendation. the horizontal axis is labeled \"weight on recommendation,\" which likely represents the relative importance of a factor in the recommendation process. the vertical axis is labeled \"items,\" which suggests the different product attributes being considered. the plot shows the following attributes: too expensive (indicating an attribute that is high cost to users). good price quality ratio (indicative of more competitive pricing). affordable (signifying cost-effectiveness for users). customer service oriented. worldwide renowned. innovative and at the forefront. makes daily practice easier. leading company. highly reputable. trustworthy. reliable. each attribute is represented by a blue dot aligned on the graph based on the strength of correlation and relative importance in terms of the weight on recommendation. attributes closer to each other and higher on the axes may suggest higher importance or correlation with other attributes. overall, the image provides a detailed visualization of various product attributes and their interrelations, specifically relating to brand image and recommendation weight.brand image vs", "type": "Document"}}
