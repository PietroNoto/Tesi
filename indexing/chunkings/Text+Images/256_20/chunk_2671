(sintering and milling technique) overall production percentage of elements base: 417 cases (providers of cad-cam elements) labo this processing includes both outsourcing and in-house 130 overall production total processing overall production definitive elements only overall production: 10,3 elements per week the image contains a pie chart titled \"overall production\" that depicts the percentage breakdown of materials used in the production. the data is presented in two ways: one pie chart shows an \"overall production total processing,\" revealing the distribution of various materials in the context of total processing units, and the other pie chart specifies \"overall production definitive elements only,\" indicating the distribution of these materials", "type": "Document"}}
