'dont know / no answer' categories suggest potential market gaps or reluctance in respondents. ### contextual integration from image-1: image-1 provides a broader context. the combined numeric data across multiple variables (intra-oral scanners to take digital impressions, chairside milling units only, and chairside milling units including scanners) aligns to show that digital technology adoption in clinics is extensive, with dentsply sirona clearly leading in almost all metrics. the inclusion of charts like image-2 is typical in market analyses to visually represent data distributions, helping stakeholders understand which brands are most popular and in what categories, facilitating strategic decisions on new acquisitions or upgrades within clinics. the image contains a bar chart focusing on scanning equipment usage across three specific contexts: intra-oral scanners taking digital impressions, chairside milling units, and chairside milling units including scanners. the bar chart shows data distribution", "type": "Document"}}
