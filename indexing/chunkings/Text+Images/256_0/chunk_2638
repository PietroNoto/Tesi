(low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) the items on the upper right side of the map, very close one to each other, will be further investigated on the factor analysis, which allow an in-depth analysis on a reduced number of variables and a more qualitative interpretation. the image contains two primary panels. the first panel to the left is a comprehensive breakdown of a correlation analysis map titled \"brand image vs recommendation - correlation analysis map\". this panel divides a two-dimensional plane into four quadrants based on two axes: weight on recommendation and item score (or pricing). the vertical axis is labeled 'weight on recommendation' ranging from \"low\" to \"high\", and the", "type": "Document"}}
