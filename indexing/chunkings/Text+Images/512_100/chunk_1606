(multiple answer) 25 base: 722 cases according to the opinion of the respondents the main consequence brought by 3d printing is related to the wider range of materials available. this is by far the most quoted one with 88% of yes, higher than the sample of dental practices. the least mentioned possible consequence brought by 3d printing is a reduction in the costs of the restorations, which received only 45% of positive responses, not so far from the results of the clinical sample (40%). it will be interesting to evaluate in the following slides, option by option, the different behaviour in the evaluated countries. a) the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden (kind of materials will broaden) b) the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase (efficiency/flexibility will increase) c) the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad- cam blocks (costs of restorations will decrease) the image shows charts indicating respondent opinions on the main consequences brought by 3d printing in the field of dentistry. the source is credited to omnivision digital, referenced from \"722 cases\". three key statements are presented with options \"yes\", \"no\", or \"don't know\". the first chart on the left evaluates agreement on the kind of materials that will be available when 3d printing is used in dentistry. in this column: **88% yes**: the most significant proportion of respondents agree that the kind of materials will broaden. **8% no**: a significantly lower percentage of respondents disagree. **4% don't know**: an even smaller portion of respondents are uncertain. the middle", "type": "Document"}}
