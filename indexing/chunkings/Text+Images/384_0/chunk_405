(fresh and synthetic).\" 2. **materials and percentages**: - cromo cobalto (chromium: cobalt): represented in dark green, occupying **47%** of the pie. - titanio (titanium): highlighted in light green, occupying **39%**. - zirconia (zirconium): light yellow-green section, accounting for **10%**. - vidrio cer\u00e1mica (ceramic glass): the smallest part in yellow, making up **3%**. the pie chart visually represents the distribution clearly,", "type": "Document"}}
