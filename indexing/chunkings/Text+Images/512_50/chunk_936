'scans sent to manufacturers / milling centers' shows a marginal increase from 5% to 7%. these specific details present an informed view of how digital technologies are increasingly part of the restoration process in dentistry, highlighting areas where digital integration is most prevalent and growing.digital technology use - channels and technologies how do you provide digital restorations in your practice? 30 base: 123 cases (digital prosthesis providers) the chart allows to evaluate the percentage of users of different technologies, in comparison to the same technologies and the different channels used. please, see the example on the right. for example, among those performing full outsourcing, 38% of them send the impressions to a manufacturer and 97% of them send the impressions to a partner lab. for example, those sending their scans or models to a partner lab in 8% of the cases they also have a chairside milling unit and in 35% of the cases they also send the scans or impressions to a manufacturer/milling center. channels percentage of surgeries - digital users only the image contains a graphical representation, commonly known as a clustered bar chart, which visualizes data about the percentage of surgeries that utilize different channels and technologies in orthopedic settings. the chart appears to be a more detailed breakdown extracted from the first image which provides context for the information presented. *description of the second image:** 1. **title and context**: - **title**: not explicitly mentioned in the image, but inferred from the context as \"percentages of surgeries - digital users only.\" - **context** (from the first image): - the chart is part of a larger discussion on how digital technology is used in providing digital restorations in medical practice. - involvement of both chairside milling and scans across different technologies and channels. 2. **axes**: - **horizontal axis (x-axis)**: represents two categories - techniques (chairside milling, scans, impressions) and channels (manufacturing, partner lab). - **vertical axis (y-axis)**: percentages ranging from 0 to 100%, showing proportion of uses in different categories. 3. **data representation**: - **techniques**: - **chairside milling**: represented by red bars for manufacturing, and pink bars for partner labs. - **scans**: represented similarly with red for manufacturing and pink for partner labs", "type": "Document"}}
