(scores from 1 definitely will not be using to 10 definitely will be using) the possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores. the clustering is the following: high risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 1 to medium risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 4 to low risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to the defection risk derives from the assumption that a low value of repurchase intention may mean a risk that in the future the product will not be used anymore. lower scores in the repurchase intention bear a higher defection risk, while higher scores mean that a current customer will probably still be using that product also in the future. mean: 6,5 2015: 25 cases mean: 7,5 base: 30 cases the repurchase intention score highlights a remarkable decrease for the low risk cluster and a subsequently increase of the high risk and medium risk clusters. due to the lower number of cases, these figures should be taken as an indication only. 73 the image contains a pie chart depicting the distribution of repurchase intention scores for one brand, presented as an average measurement for the year the chart is divided into four segments, each representing a different repurchase", "type": "Document"}}
