Thanks \nto a given number of known \nvariables (in this case the \nreasons to buy), the factor \nanalysis finds out some \nlatent factors being able to \nstatistically summarize the \nexplicit variables.\nBetter \nperformance\nImage and \ninnovation\nPatient \ncare\nIndependence \nfrom the lab\nThe acquisition of a CAD-CAM will reduce the working time\n0,79\nThe acquisition of a CAD-CAM will bring me economical/financial savings\n0,64\nIt will improve the quality of my work\n0,75\nIt\u2019s a technology required to meet the future challenges\n0,66\nIt will improve the image of my clinic\n0,76\nIt is important to make use of more innovative materials\n0,77\nMy patients demand for this type of technology\n0,78\nIt is important to offer my patients the restoration/prosthesis in one visit/day\n0,73\nI would like to depend less upon the prosthetic lab\n0,94\n", "type": "Document"}}
