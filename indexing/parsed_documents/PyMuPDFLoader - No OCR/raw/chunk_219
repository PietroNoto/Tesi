The goal is to synthesize and reduce \nthe data by summarizing the information contained in many variables into a few synthetic factors. Each factor showed its own common features, resulting statistically \ndifferent from each other factor. The obtained factors have been considered to carry out the cluster analysis.\nThis factor analysis led to the identification of five factors into which the different variables considered were grouped.\n26\nBarriers for non-owner prospects \u2013 Factor Analysis\nHow much do you consider the following aspects an obstacle to adopting an intraoral scanner in your practice?\nBase: 144 (respondents who do not have IOS)\n\u2713BACKWARDNESS: this driver \nencompasses elements that seem \nunrelated and may appear trivial, but \nfrom the researchers' perspective, it \nrepresents a single driver of justifications \nrooted in biases rather than real issues.\n\u2713EXPENSIVENESS: the problems in this \narea are related to convenience, where \nexcessive investment is predominant, but \nalso include concerns about technology \nevolution, although with a low correlation, \nand model printing.\n\u2713RESISTANCE TO CHANGE: this area \nencompasses issues related to mindset, in \nparticular potential biases and prejudices \nfrom both dentists and their laboratories.\n\u2713COMPATIBILITY: this factor includes \naspects related to compatibility with \ncertain software or aligner systems.\n\u2713FULL ARCH ISSUES: the issues falling \nunder this factor are related to full arches, \nincluding aspects related to the \nergonomics of the handpiece and long \nworking times.\nNON-OWNERS ONLY\nDrivers of resistance\nThe resistances are grouped into subjective and objective drivers\nCROSS LOADING: When certain items are present in two factors, it means that they partially contribute to both drivers. \nThe numerical values refer to the degree of correlation (mean 0, variance +/-1).\n", "type": "Document"}}
