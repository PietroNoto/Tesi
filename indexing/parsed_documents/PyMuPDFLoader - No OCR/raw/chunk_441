Moreover, a closer cooperation with the industry is expected as well.\nWe are working on a further deepening of the topics investigated on an extensive, integrated report, which will \ninclude findings from both surveys (clinical and technical) and will contain our conclusions about the overall results. \n", "type": "Document"}}
