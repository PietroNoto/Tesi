Not only in terms of \naccuracy and reliability, but also handiness and wide range of materials available. \nStart-up training is considered to be a topic necessary to the use of the product, \nnot properly related to the service a company can provide, but most of all it\u2019s \nnecessary to the same use of the product.\nFactor 2 (Support and assistance) the second factor shows all soft components \nrelated to the grade of availability and support the company can provide to their \ncustomers in the use of the digital technologies. The strongest items of this factor \nare the Technical support and the Business development support. It\u2019s interesting to \nnote that what was not relevant to the assessment of the overall satisfaction in the \nanalysis on dental practices, for the laboratories, the Business development \nsupport becomes relevant and it is among the driving items of the second factor.\nFactor 3 (Management costs) The new digital technologies have to be considered a business of the dental laboratories, like it was for dental practices, so that the management costs are \nalso important to make this business profitable for the dental labs. In this sense, the running costs and the cost for SW updates make a separate factor accounting for the overall \nsatisfaction. This factor has not to be confused with the cost for acquiring a digital equipment, but clearly, the ordinary costs, sustained every year to run the digital business, do have \ntheir own importance.\nFactor 4 (Compatibility) The fourth and last factor is strictly related to the compatibility with other systems, which allows for a easy way to expand the business and meet the needs from \nthe clients (dentists and other laboratories). An open systems surely helps the users to be more flexible and ready to face the different situations that digital restorations shows.\n4 Factors\nProduct quality\nSupport and \nassistance\nManagement \ncosts\nCompatibility\nAccuracy and quality of the restorations\n0,807\nReliability\n0,733\nHandiness / ease of use\n0,730\nWide range of materials available\n0,607\nStart-up training\n0,552\nTechnical support from the company\n0,734\nBusiness development support\n0,709\nCompany availability and flexibility\n0,679\nTechnical assistance in case of repair\n0,668\nFrequency of SW updates\n0,601\nCost of SW updates\n0,811\nOverall running costs\n0,752\nCompatibility with other brands\n0,806\n", "type": "Document"}}
