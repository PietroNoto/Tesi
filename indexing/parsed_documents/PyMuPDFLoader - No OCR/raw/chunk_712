The bivariate correlation analysis has been used to quantify the relation between the score on \nthe single satisfaction items and the rating on the overall satisfaction.\nTherefore, it is possible to retrieve a \u201chierarchy of importance\u201d from the individual statements and to display \nthem in a chart, and then on a map. The vertical axis always shows the satisfaction ratings that the different \nfactors have received, on average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence on the overall satisfaction. In \nthis way, its obtained an \u201cestimated importance\u201d of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a \nbit different from the one explicitly stated. The analysis of the weight of each of the factors, and not only of \nthe declared importance, allows for some interesting considerations. The items have a different meaning \naccording to the point of view with which they are considered:\nSTATISTICAL NOTE\n\u25aa\nSatisfaction related to the whole market\nHere we can highlight some prerequisites (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors \nsatisfy the market), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, where companies are not \nalways able to satisfy customers with regard to strategic issues), and indifference areas (lower-left side of \nthe map) which become waste/not efficient areas when a company decides to invest in those items \nbelonging to the upper-left side of the map, since they tend to satisfy the market but they actually don\u2019t \naffect the overall satisfaction at all.\n\u25aa\nSatisfaction related to a specific company/product\nHere the scheme is the same, but we can highlight the strength points in the upper-right side of the map, \nwhich can determine inefficiency or indifference if placed in the left side of the map. In the lower-right we \ncan note an improvement area, where we can find the weak points of a certain company (higher than \naverage weight on the company satisfaction but lower than average satisfaction score).\n103\n", "type": "Document"}}
