Seldom is possible to \nsee an item in the factor analysis which carries together items related to the \nproduct component and to the service as well. In this case, the technical \nassistance and the SW updates go hand in hand with the accuracy and the ease \nof use.\nFactor 2 (Easy practice) the second factor has some soft components related to \nthe grade of availability the company has to make the daily practice easy in the \nuse of the digital technologies. This is true, according to the results of this \nanalysis, when a company gives support in starting up the digital business, \nwhen the company is available and flexible and a wide range of materials is \navailable. All of that, makes a company look reliable as well.\n4 Factors\nProduct and \nservice quality\nEasy practice\nManagement \ncosts\nCompatibility\nTechnical support from the company\n0,844\nTechnical assistance in case of repair\n0,810\nAccuracy and overall quality of the restorations\n0,779\nHandiness / ease of use\n0,778\nFrequency of SW updates from the company\n0,729\nStart-up training\n0,800\nWide range of materials available\n0,774\nAvailability and flexibility of the company\n0,672\nReliability\n0,552\nCost of SW updates\n0,822\nOverall running costs\n0,605\nCompatibility with other brands\n0,907\nFactor 3 (Management costs) not to forget that the new digital technologies can be considered a business of the practice, so that the management costs are also important to make this \nbusiness profitable for the practice. In this sense, the running costs and the cost for SW updates make a separate factor accounting for the overall satisfaction. This factor has not to be \nconfused with the cost for acquiring a digital equipment, but clearly, the ordinary costs, sustained every year to run the digital business do have their own importance.\nFactor 4 (Compatibility) The fourth and last factor is strictly related to the compatibility of the system with other systems, which allows for a easy way to expand the business and meet \nthe needs from the patients. An open systems surely helps the users to be more flexible and ready to face the different situations that digital restorations shows.\n", "type": "Document"}}
