The results show that 3Shape has the highest relationship between the brand from which the labs receive the scanner and the \nrecommendation. It is also true that 3Shape, due to its popularity and seniority in the IOS market, has a high frequency of recommendation even in \nlabs receiving scans from other brands. In fact, it is always cited as the second brand regardless of the brand of IOS from which the labs receive scans \n(for Carestream it is the first). This also shows that 3Shape's reputation is very high. \nBase: 524 cases\n3Shape\nDentsply \nSirona\niTero\nMedit\nCarestream\nPlanmeca\n3Shape\n55%\n26%\n29%\n24%\n33%\n17%\nDentsply \nSirona\n12%\n30%\n9%\n5%\n7%\n13%\niTero\n13%\n12%\n37%\n20%\n16%\n21%\nMedit\n8%\n12%\n8%\n38%\n8%\n2%\nCarestream\n7%\n9%\n5%\n8%\n32%\n8%\nPlanmeca\n2%\n7%\n7%\n2%\n1%\n35%\nIOS brand: Received files\nIOS brand: recommendation\n", "type": "Document"}}
