    "text": "as one can easily deduce, the presence of a dental technician within the practice increases as the size of the dental office grows. 12 base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) 13 brand awareness: dental products in general awareness analysis brand awareness analysis glossary unaided awareness it represents the entire group of brands of a certain product family, recalled by the interviewed sample. within the boundaries of spontaneous awareness, the consumer reasonably decides to make a purchase. aided awareness and total awareness the aided awareness represents the awareness level of the brands named by the interviewer. the total awareness is made up of the unaided awareness and by the aided one. the aided awareness shows how many respondents identify the brand once it is quoted, it is an important index in the buying process but, if it is not sustained by a high level of unaided awareness, the company needs more efforts to reach a better commercial effectiveness. top of mind it is the first brand, named by the interviewee, related to a certain product family. it is the closest indicator to the intention to buy or to the current use of the products and it is strictly linked to the brand value. prominence index it is the relationship between top of mind and unaided awareness; it is an indicator of knowledge quality and it estimates the brand capability to represent the product family to those who know it, regardless its overall awareness. relevance index it is the relationship between unaided awareness and the aided one. it defines the brand capability to be recalled whenever the customer decides to make a purchase. 14 14 dental products in general: unaided awareness what company brands come to your mind, when speaking about dental products in general? regarding the mentioned brands, it is interesting to note that dentsply sirona has gained as much awareness as 3m. ivoclar remains one of the most frequently mentioned brands, followed by kerr and gc. among the top mentioned brands, we can still find henry schein among the dealers, and it is noteworthy that straumann is mentioned among the top 10 brands overall, while in 2018 no implants brand was mentioned. 15 the overlap index represents the average number of brands mentioned by each respondent: the sum of the percentage is 435%, that is, on average each respondent mentioned slightly more than 4 brands (overlap index: 4,35). 123% overlap index: 4,35 first and foremost, an increase in overlap can be observed (from 300% to 435%), mainly due to the mention of a greater number of brands in general. this phenomenon is widespread in all analyzed countries compared to the last edition in base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) dental products in general: unaided awareness what company brands come to your mind, when speaking about dental products in general? overlap index 4,60 3,68 4,69 4,70 4,39 the awareness analysis in different countries highlights a lower overlap index in germany, while spain has the highest index. 3m remains the most mentioned brand in italy and spain, while, albeit slightly, the awareness of dentsply sirona is higher in other countries, germany above all. gc, which is known to be strong in france, shows higher awareness in that country, while ivoclar is more mentioned in italy and spain, where voco also performs above average (in the latter). 16 base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) dental products in general: prominence index what company brands come to your mind, when speaking about dental products in general? 17 the phenomenon observed this year regarding the increase in the number of mentioned brands leads to a general decrease in the \"prominence index.\" with numerous brands being mentioned, it is less likely for the same brand to be mentioned as the first one. however, it is noticeable that 3m has experienced a more significant decrease in their \"prominence index\" compared to other brands. among them, dentsply sirona demonstrates better performance and is the only one that surpasses the index recorded in the previous edition. it is also worth noting the overall increase in ivoclar awareness, although the tom (top of mind) performance is about on the same level of this causes a decreased performance in the \"prominence index if compared to note: the comparison between the \"unaided awareness\" and the \"top of mind\", highlights relevant differences in the prominence index: a higher index value indicates the brand's ability to represent a product family. example: ivoclar is recalled to mind spontaneously by 35% of the respondents as a brand and 20% of those who know the brand, have mentioned it as the first one. base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) unaided awareness + prominence + dental products in general: prominence index what company brands come to your mind, when speaking about dental products in general? high quantity of awareness with less immediate association to the product category high quantity of awareness with high immediate association to the product category 18 note: the map relates quantitative awareness data (unaided awareness) with a qualitative index that represents the brand attitude to be immediately associated with the product category (prominence). in the upper right side of the map there are brands with an unaided awareness above the average one and higher immediate association to the product category. if we consider the \"prominence index\" as the ability of a brand to represent a specific product category, it can be stated that 3m and dentsply sirona are the two brands that most represent the dental products segment. as mentioned in the previous slide, on the left map, a significant increase in unaided awareness by ivoclar can be observed. regarding the other brands, there don't appear to be substantial differences compared to the last survey. (1.018 cases) (966 cases) overlap index: 4,35 3,07 dental products in general: unaided awareness 2023-2018 comparison unaided awareness top of mind please, bear in mind that the statistical error ranges +/-3% therefore the differences in this range should not considered to be statistically relevant. as anticipated, the overlap index in this years edition is significantly higher than in the year 2018: 4,35 vs 3, this result is clearly visible in the left sided chart, where the increase of the unaided awareness is relevant for almost every brand shown in the chart. the top of mind analysis, on the contrary, show a different situation for the investigated brands: 3m is the brand showing a significant decrease, while dentsply sirona, on the other hand, is the only brand showing a relevant tom increase. 19 the investigated countries in both periods are: france, germany, italy, spain, the united kingdom. dentsply sirona 22% 0 dentsply sirona 20% 0 dentsply sirona 35% 0 3m 20% 0 3m 16% 0 3m 18% 0 ivoclar 7% 0 gc 10% 0 ivoclar 8% 0 kerr 6% 0 kerr 5% 0 kavo 7% 0 gc 5% 0 kavo 4% 0 kulzer 7% 0 kavo 5% 0 henry schein 4% 0 coltene 4% 0 kulzer 3% 0 ivoclar 3% 0 gc 3% 0 henry schein 3% 0 septodont 3% 0 kuraray noritake 3% 0 coltene 2% 0 gsk 3% 0 henry schein 2% 0 other 27% other 33% other 13% don't know / no answer 0% don't know / no answer 0% don't know / no answer 0% total 100% total 200 total 224 3m 23% 0 3m 26% 0 dentsply sirona 20% 0 dentsply sirona 16% 0 dentsply sirona 13% 0 3m 16% 0 kerr 14% 0 ivoclar 10% 0 ivoclar 9% 0 ivoclar 7% 0 gc 6% 0 gc 9% 0 henry schein 4% 0 voco 6% 0 kerr 7% 0 kavo 3% 0 oral b 5% 0 kulzer 6% 0 kulzer 3% 0 kavo 4% 0 coltene 4% 0 gc 3% 0 kerr 4% 0 septodont 4% 0 coltene 2% 0 lacer 3% 0 voco 3% 0 other 27% other 23% other 23% don't know / no answer 1% don't know / no answer 0% don't know / no answer 0% total 200 total 194 total 200 all countries fr de it sp uk dental products in general: top of mind summary tom increase more than 2% tom decrease more than 2% tom stable the awareness comparison has been performed on the top of mind of the past edition of the brand equity study in the symbols are the following: 20 dental products in general: relevance index unaided: what company brands come to your mind, when speaking about dental products in general?",

39 regarding the price, among all company brands that you know, which one is the closest to each of the following attributes? good but expensive very affordable ideal quality/price ratio too expensive base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) attribute associations: summary 40 for each brand, the table summarizes to 100% the number of quotes received for the given attributes. it is not a frequency distribution among all brands, but for each brand, a frequency distribution of all attributes is shown. for example: out of 3m total quotes, scientific represents 9%. in dentsply sirona distribution, the attribute with the highest number of quotes is digital company, while for gc is excellent/the best. key take aways 41 in several cases, dentsply sirona is mentioned more frequently compared to various attributes, closely approaching - and in some cases surpassing - the performance of 3m. this is true, for example, for the attributes \"high reputation, \"innovative / cutting edge, flexible / versatile, young and modern. it is worth noting an improvement in ivoclar performance: \"innovative / cutting edge, \"friendly / intimate,\" and \"easy to use\" are some examples where the percentage of respondents mentioning this brand has significantly increased. there is an increase in brand awareness for companies in the digital world. although this may not be evident in overall brand awareness, it becomes clear when analyzing specific attributes. for example, align technology is mentioned in the attributes \"innovative / cutting edge,\" \"young and modern,\" and \"reliable.\" regarding digital brands, it is also worth highlighting their significant presence in the attribute \"innovative / cutting edge,\" a phenomenon not observed in a separate mention should be made for the attribute \"digital company\": apart from the obvious presence of brands in this area, it is interesting to note the clear positioning of dentsply sirona, which aligns well with the strategic change undertaken several years ago, making it the top brand mentioned in this context. key take aways 42 regarding the price positioning, there is a noticeable shift in dentsply sirona performance, as it not the first quoted brand anymore for the item very affordable\" while it is the first quoted one in the items more related to a premium price area. there is a significant improvement for ivoclar in the attribute \"ideal quality/price ratio,\" making it the third most mentioned brand in this edition after 3m and dentsply sirona. analyzing the frequency distributions of the items by individual brand, the following phenomena can be observed: for 3m, the item \"scientific\" is mentioned more frequently compared to \"high reputation\" in for dentsply sirona, the focus on the digital field is confirmed, but in terms of price, the most mentioned item is \"too expensive\" instead of \"good but expensive\" in for ivoclar, the scientific and innovative areas are mentioned more frequently, along with ease of use and flexibility. it is interesting to note the shift from \"good but expensive\" to \"ideal quality/price ratio.\" for kulzer, the most mentioned items are \"effective / concrete\" and \"flexible / versatile.\" correspondence analysis it is a descriptive statistical technique applicable to qualitative variables, whose purpose is to summarize and plot the relationships expressed by a frequency table. the analysis allows to represent as points of the same space (typically a plane) the considered variables, i.e. the rows and columns of the frequency table. with this system, the similarities / differences between rows and / or columns are processed respectively in proximity / distance of the points from one another. through the use of this statistical technique, it is possible to highlight the perception of the respondents and make a comparison among the brands under analysis. depending on the position of the attributes on the plan (active variables) and the proximity of the passive variables (represented by the brands), the perceived positioning in the imagery of the sample can be better understood. statistical note 43 correspondence analysis: positioning drivers 44 sustainable value and convenience this concept encompasses the effectiveness and practicality of the brand, social responsibility and environmental awareness, ease of use, flexibility and versatility, as well as a friendly and intimate approach in the customer experience. the perception is a convenient offering while respecting sustainability and user needs. those brands provide dentists with everything they need in a 360-degree approach. premium authority this definition summarizes the attributes present in this area: a high reputation based on a solid scientific foundation, excellence and superior quality, inspiring trust, a brands history and tradition. however, the attribute too expensive indicates that it may be considered a high-end or luxury brand with a higher price compared to the average. tech-forward leadership this area represents brands that stand out for their innovation, advanced digital presence, and the young and modern image they convey. these attributes indicate that the brand is at the forefront of new technologies, digitally oriented, and targeting a young and modern audience. tech- forward leadership emphasizes leadership in the technological field and the companys modern approach in providing innovative solutions. unlike the map proposed in 2018, the correspondence analysis in this edition does not clearly present two main axes. however, it is possible to identify certain positioning areas that are characterized by the presence of specific attributes that give rise to the names of these areas, as described below: correspondence analysis: positioning drivers 45 sustainable value and convenience premium authority tech-forward leadership correspondence analysis: complete map 46 correspondence analysis: brands only 47 sustainable value and convenience premium authority tech-forward leadership key take aways 48 first and foremost, it is interesting to note the positioning of orthodontic companies, which are primarily those belonging to the world of invisible aligner manufacturers. their positioning is perfectly compatible with the belonging area on this map. as observed in the past, catalog sales/mail-order businesses are positioned in the convenience area. straumann's positioning is heavily focused on performance, excellence, and the premium concept. it is noteworthy the positioning of dentsply sirona in the perception of dentists: it is close to the digital technology area but also relevant to the concept of being premium, as previously observed in the frequency distribution of attributes that have been analyzed. ivoclar and ultradent are positioned close to the concepts of effectiveness, practicality, and ease of use, with the brand gc being particularly close to the latter. kulzer's positioning is closely associated with the concepts of flexibility and versatility, voco with good value for money, and zhermack is closer to the convenience area. 49 brand image: items score brand positioning mean all brands (1.142 quotes) brand image: focus on brands - all brands in your opinion, how do you rate the mentioned brands in the following

brand positioning bivariate correlation analysis the bivariate correlation analysis is a technique that helps to identify and measure the influence of the independent variables (in this case, current users) on the dependent one (in this case, the recommendation). the bivariate correlation analysis has been used to quantify the relation between the score on the single items and the rating on the recommendation. therefore, it is possible to retrieve a hierarchy of importance from the individual statements and to display them in a chart, and then on a map. the vertical axis always shows the scores that the different items have received, on average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence on the recommendation. in this way, its obtained an estimated importance of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a bit different from the score explicitly stated. the analysis of the weight of each of the statements, and not only of the declared importance, allows for some interesting considerations. the items have a different meaning according to the point of view with which they are considered: statistical note recommendation related to the whole market here we can highlight some prerequisites (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors perform positively), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, where companies are not always able to meet the expectations with regard to strategic issues), and indifference areas (lower-left side of the map) which become waste/not efficient areas when a company decides to invest in those items belonging to the upper-left side of the map, since they show a lower weight on the recommendation. recommendation related to a specific company/product here the scheme is the same, but we can highlight the strength points in the upper-right side of the map, which can determine inefficiency or indifference if placed in the left side of the map. in the lower-right we can note an improvement area, where we can find the weak points of a certain company (higher than average item weight on the recommendation but lower than average item score). 63 items importance average score brand image vs recommendation: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? overall 64 the charts show the weight that the items evaluated have on the propensity to recommend a given brand, and on the right, their individual score. high quality, trust and innovation are the items showing the highest correlation with the recommendation. brand image vs

analysis reveals certain prerequisites, such as high reputation, high quality, trust, and innovation. these can be regarded as attributes that users generally expect to find in a brand they use. this

recommendation for dentsply. however, it is interesting to note that the items related to familiarity and customer orientation are not far off from those just mentioned. brand image vs recommendation: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? dentsply sirona 69 focus on brands while it is true that the most significant items in determining the recommendation also receive ratings above the average, it is still interesting to note that customer orientation, which still holds above-average weight on the recommendation, does not receive ratings in line with the key attributes. instead, it falls below the average, indicating a potential area for improvement.

henry schein, megadental, gacd, and proclinic confirm their position as the main suppliers mentioned by the sample of respondents. however, some exclusively online suppliers are present in the top positions of the numerical distribution. this is the case with dental leader, dental good deal, and dentalclick. furthermore, it is worth highlighting the increase in the numerical distribution of dentsply sirona compared to 2018. 107 114% base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) dental dealers: numeric distribution - pqi index who are your main suppliers for consumable products? 108 the comparison between numeric distribution and the \"top used\", highlights relevant differences in the pqi index. example: henry schein is used by 33% of the respondents and 42% of them uses it as the main supplier. proclinic is less frequently quoted overall, but it is mentioned as the first supplier more frequently than henry schein (51%). the overlap index represents the average number of providers mentioned by each respondent: the sum of the percentage is 276%, that is, on average each respondent uses slightly less than 3 (2,76) providers for consumable products. it is interesting to note how the number of suppliers has increased compared to this is highlighted by the pqi index, which has gone from just over 1,5 to almost the use of multiple suppliers appears to be a structural trend in dentists purchasing behavior, thanks also to various online proposals. in fact, traditional dealers are noticed alongside online suppliers in the top positions of the frequency distribution. base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) dental dealers: numeric distribution - pqi index map who are your main suppliers for consumable products? the information described before, may be easily visualized in this positioning map, in which the quantitative variable (numeric distribution) and qualitative variable (pqi) are intersected. among the generalist suppliers, proclinic stands out as having the best performance in terms of the pqi index, meaning it is mentioned more frequently as the primary supplier. henry schein is by far the most mentioned overall and shows an improved ability to be mentioned as the first supplier in the practice compared to however, other main suppliers also show a better pqi index performance (e.g., in addition to proclinic, megadental and dental leader). although the numerical distribution is still low (4%), aera-online is the leading supplier in terms of pqi index performance. 109 numeric distribution + pqi index + base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) expectations about the future future changes in the activity of the practice do you plan to make changes to your practice over the next two years? just under half of the surveyed sample declares anticipating a change in their clinic's activity in the next two years. this percentage is higher in the uk, italy, and spain. approximately 2 out of 3 german respondents, on the other hand, state that they do not foresee any changes in the next two years. 111 changes to the practice base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) future changes in the activity of the practice do you plan to make changes to your practice over the next two years?

output focus group users 10 cad cam experience and user profile sirona is unanimous among dentists as a brand reference; dentists see as an advantage the fact of sirona having a branch in brazil, which makes prices much lower and the proximity with the customer much higher. they also see as an advantage to be able to buy directly from the manufacturer, while for other companies, the purchase is made through a dealer / importer. for those who already had contact with other brands, the technical quality is the same, there is little change in the software design and the convenience of having sirona in brazil makes a great difference. they think they could receive more courses and trainings output focus group users 11 12 glossary confidence level indicates the research credibility level. as an example, a 95% confidence level means that the data acknowledged by the research is secure in 95% of the cases. confidence interval indicates how much the research data deviate from reality. though the research results are representative, they may not perfectly match those that would be obtained if the entire population was considered, each probing has an approximation degree that makes up the research's maximum error. in this case, the confidence interval of +-4% indicates that if data in the research equals 50%, the actual result may vary in +4% or -4%, i.e, it should be considered between 64%(60%+4%) and 56% (60%-4%). calculation basis for contingency data generally, the development presented here is calculated based on the responses of interviewees (usually the charts are blue colored) and indicate the percentage of dentists that achieve a given result. in other cases, certain questions have a quantitative nature (number of fillings, number of chairs, number of patients, etc.) and in this case, the reference base is the total amount in respect to the analyzed subject. (% of fillings, % of chairs, % of patients, etc.), in this case, the charts are usually green colored. other types of sample are indicated separately (e.g., % or average of fillings with amalgam in the full probing or only related to those that used amalgam). types of questions the research was completely developed with close-ended questions, which would result a single answer (therefore, the total of answers with a 100% result) or multiple answers (in this case, the sum of answers above 100% because the interviewee could choose one or more options). questions with multiple responses were indicated by the side of the corresponding chart. research sample 13 the analysis of this study is made up and analyzed by three segmentations of responding dental practices: random sample: responding dental practices resulting from a random database of brazilian practices. owners sample: responding dental practices that have cad-cam equipment (scanner and/or chairside dental milling) rising out of a random database and dentsply sirona clients database plus users of random sample (60+10). total sample: sum of answers of random and owners samples. + 60 users (oversample) region cases % north + center-west region 82 14% northeast region 93 16% southeast region (without so paulo) 127 22% southeast region (with so paulo) 176 31% south region 92 16% total 570 100% the table refers to the number of cases measured by each nielsen area. the north region has a poorer statistical result and, thus, was aggregated to the center-west region. southwest, which represents about 60% of the country's economy, presents a high number of cases, which even allowed to isolate the state of so paulo, in order to evaluate data separately. the sample consists of 570 dental practices stratified by nielsen areas. to correctly represent the brazilian market, the analyzed cases were weighed. the weight was calculated considering the distribution of practices in the brazilian states. segmentation data structural and demographic segmentation 2,1 dental chairs mean: 1995 49 years 2.1 dentists demographic segmentation demographic and structural segmentation 15 base: 570 cases total sample random sample equivalent dentists are the amount of dentists working in a practice. the number was calculated considering dentists who work full-time, summed to the rotating services provider dentists. it is considered that for each 5 services provider dentists there is 1 full time dentist, considering that on average an office has 5 dentists in rotation per week. segmentation parameters 16 random sample social class of patients monthly expenditure on consumable materials mean monthly revenue internal laboratory mean: brl 2,603 mean: brl 19,916 base: 570 cases total sample production / services 17 random sample base: 570 cases total sample mean: 57.6 patients per week number of weekly appointments number of precision impressions mean: 10.7 precision printings per week number of implant surgeries mean: 55.1 implant surgeries in the last year practice management 18 random sample business plan work costs awareness awareness of the cost of treatments and markup base: 570 cases total sample the world of cad-cam technology users sample: 70 users (owners) purchase behavior cad-cam reasons for the purchase of cad-cam equipment in the moment when you decided to invest in a cad-cam equipment, what was the reason that made you buy a cad-cam? 21 base: 70 cases owners among the drivers for an office to invest in cad-cam equipment, there are, specially factors related to the increase in productivity and performance, specially for 61% of the owners save work time. owners sample reasons for the purchase of cad-cam equipment how much do you agree with the following claims about the moment when you decided to invest in cad-cam? please, rate 1 to 10, 1 being completely disagree and 10 completely agree. 22 base: 70 cases owners mean owners sample pillars of reasons for purchase cad-cam equipment cad-cam perceived image. 23 the reduction in factors made by those who purchased a cad-cam device allows to identify three pillars of perceived image regarding cad-cam: future oriented: includes the items that express an innovation concept, which through the cad-cam technology will be improved, whether the quality of materials used or the office's image itself. added value: includes items that express a concept of improvement in the offer of services and economical and financial advantages coming from the purchase of the product.",

    "text": "those with a business plan have a higher awareness of work costs and profit margins are more alert about the added value and give less importance to independence. the concept of independence is stronger between those who are less interested in management aspects. those who make many implants are much more focused on added value aspects. owners sample purchase decision process regarding your equipment's purchase, of the two claims below, which one gets closer of how was the purchase decision process? 25 base: 70 cases owners impulse/emotional purchase shows to be very relevant in this business. among the interviews with cad-cam equipment owners, was investigated how was the decision-making process of this equipment. it was observed that even in high-cost equipment, in 43% of cases the decision was spontaneous and almost emotional. on the other hand, 57% of the respondents said they have studied the benefits, costs and returns, that is, a rational purchase. - in those up to 50 years old the behavior is more emotive while older people tend to look more carefully at the benefits and costs. - the impulse purchase is higher among those who have higher revenue and who produce less impressions impulse purchases are also common among those who have a business plan and awareness of their costs and revenues. owners sample satisfaction and loyalty analysis cad-cam advantages in the use of intraoral scanner what are the most relevant advantages for you in the use of your intraoral scanner? (open ended question) 27 base: 70 cases scanner owners owners sample among the most mentioned advantages there are quickness and praticality, factors related with the increase of productivity and performance. such factors are followed by precision and quality, factors related with the final result's quality. the results are consistent with expectations and reason why cad-cam equipment was bought (slide51). advantage in the use of the chairside milling unit what are the most relevant advantages for you in the use of your chairside milling unit? (open ended question) 28 base: 65 cases chairside owners the main advantage mentioned is \"increased productivity related to increase productivity and performance. the second advantage mentioned is \"better accuracy of the result\", factor related to the quality of the final result. owners sample loyalty metrics cad-cam satisfaction analysis expresses the overall experience with a brand and up to which point the customers' needs are met. perceived value usefulness and perceived benefits of product compared with the cost paid for such product. advocacy the willingness of an user to recommend a company to colleagues is a key factor for revenue and profit growth in most industries. rebuying intention the probability of an user continuing to use the company's products in a near future. brand advocacy score the interviewees are rated as \"advocates\", \"neutral\" or non-advocate\" for each brand. for each brand overall, bas subtracts the distribution percentage of non-advocates from the distribution percentage of advocates, to show the actual impact of mouth to mouth indication. 30 loyalty metrics general satisfaction loyalty metrics perceived value inclination to recommend repurchse intention brand advocacy score advocate extremely likely what is the likelyhood of you recommending the following company brands to a colleague? very likely neutral non- advocate little likely satisfaction analysis: satisfaction level score how would you evaluate your satisfaction with cad-cam products (intraoral scanners and chairside milling unit) of the following companies to several aspects? please, use a 1 to 10 scale, where 1 represents \"completely not satisfied\" and 10 represents \"completely satisfied\". 31 owners sample users (64 cases) mean how important are these items on the construction of the satisfaction? correlation analysis the correlation analysis is a technique that helps to identify and to measure the influence of independent variables (in this case, current and former users) over the dependent one (in this case, overall satisfaction). it was used to quantify the ratio between score and individual factors and evaluation over satisfaction. therefore, it is possible to retrieve an \"importance hierarchy\" of individual demonstrations and to show them in a chart and, then, in a map. the vertical axis always shows the rating that the different instructions have received, in an average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence over the global satisfaction. thus, we get an \"estimated importance\" of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a little different of that explicitly declared. the analysis of each factor's weigh, and not only the stated importance, allows some interesting considerations. the items have a different meaning according with the viewpoint with which they are considered: 32 statistical note satisfaction before the whole market: here we can emphasize some prerequisites (each upper right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors serve the market), some key factors to success (lower right corner of the map, where the companies are not always able to satisfy customers regarding strategical matters), and indifference areas (lower left corner), that constitute waste/inefficiency areas when a company decides to invest in such items belonging to the upper left corner of the map, since they are prone to meet the market, but they really do not affect the overall satisfaction. satisfaction regarding a specific company/product: here the scheme is the same, but the strong points are highlighted in the upper right corner of the map, where we can establish the inefficiency or low differentiation when placed in the left side of the map. in the lower right corner we can notice an improvement area, where we can meet the weak points of a given company. overall satisfaction rank hierarchy of importance of items. users 33 in the charts the weight of the evaluated items over brand satisfaction are represented. items with a high score can be perceived, but these are not relevant in the building of satisfaction and vice-versa. weight per item on the satisfaction score focus on the mean users (64 cases) weight on the satisfaction items score + + critical improvement areas correlation analysis: general satisfaction how much worth individual items on global satisfaction? users 34 the map is the visual result of the two charts seem in the previous slide. in the horizontal axis there is the weight of each item on the satisfaction, in the vertical axis there is the overall satisfaction index of each item. the items are organized on the map in a manner that in the upper right part there are the items that a) are very relevant in the general satisfaction and b) the dentists are more satisfied than the average. in the lower part, on the other hand, there are items which a) are very relevant to overall satisfaction and b) the dentists are not more satisfied with than the average. this map shows the evaluated items in general for all the brands and it is a good reference to compare each brand. the pillars of satisfaction satisfaction factors 35 factorial analysis aims to synthesize data, summarizing information contained in many variables in some synthetical factors. the purpose is to identify an underlying structure to a set of observed variables and to resume this substructure with a reduced number of main variables. the reduction of factors allowed to obtain 2 factors according with the customer's imagination: product / service: the factor is characterized in the customer's imagination partially by articles related with the product's performance and, on the other hand, made up by the company's service. after sale: includes all aspects regarding the relationship between the company and the user regarding after sale services. product / service after sale ease of use 0,806 wide range of materials available 0,788 availability and flexibility of the companies in case of specific doubts 0,755 precision and general quality of the restorations 0,722 enterprise technical support 0,635 initial formation and updating trainings 0,581 trustworthy 0,567 technical assistance in case of repair 0,685 supporting the development of business 0,652 general operating costs 0,753 frequency of software updates 0,725 cost of softwares updating 0,725 owners sample the weight of pillars in overall satisfaction satisfaction factors 36 overall satisfaction 40% after sale 60% product / service in general terms, the product / service factor has a significant weigh, the product's performance characteristics are, therefore, highly important to determine the overall satisfaction. however, even after sale services play a central role, being in charge for 40% of the satisfaction perception. sirona users make up about 90% of owners and, therefore, have a behavior very similar to the analyzed sample, with a slightly higher weight of after sales. the regression analysis is a multivariate statistical technique, whose main goal is to discover the existing relationship between one target variable (dependent variable, in this case, satisfaction) and a set of independent variables (each unique factor derived from factorial analysis). thus, trying to understand and to foresee the behavior of the target variable according with changes in independent variables. one of the main focus of multiple regression is to evaluate how much part of the dependent variable (satisfaction) is explained by independent variables, in other words, how much these factors influence the behavior of a dependent variable. in order to complete the factorial analysis, it is important to also evaluate the weight of these factors on the overall satisfaction, in order to understand if the improvement in one of the factors may also improve the satisfaction of a given brand. the figure r2=0.716 means that about 72% of the satisfaction is explained and based on these factors: owners sample loyalty metrics 37 brand advocacy score (b.a.s.) the interviewees are rated as \"advocates\", \"neutral\" or non-advocate\" of each brand. for each brand, b.a.s. subtracts the distribution percentage of non-advocates from the distribution percentage of advocates, to show the actual impact of mouth to mouth indication. perceived value inclination to recommend repurchase intention mean mean mean up to which point do you agree that cad-cam products of the following manufacturers worth their purchase price? what is the likelyhood of you recommending cad-cam products of the following companies to a colleague? if you had to replace your current cad-cam, system, how likely would it be that for you to buy the same brand again? b.a.s.* 28% the risk of abandonment derives from the assumption that a low value of repurchase intention may mean a risk of, in the future, the product no longer being used. lower scores in repurchase intention have a higher risk of abandonment, while higher values mean that a current customer will likely still use this product in the future. even if the perception of perceived value is negative, this item does not impact on the trend towards recommendation or repurchase intention. high cost/benefit average cost/benefit low cost/benefit advocate neutral non-advocate low risk medium risk high risk owners sample potential market for cad-cam cad-cam world overview position regarding cad-cam technologies what is your position regarding cad-cam technologies (particularly, intraoral scanning and chairside milling unit)? 40 base: 570 cases total sample random sample analyzing the clusters of dental practices, it can be noticed among younger dentists, among practices with higher number of chairs and among practices the serve predominantly patients of a high social class, a higher level than the average for comfort with cad-cam technology. position regarding cad-cam technologies what is your position regarding cad-cam technologies (particularly, intraoral scanning and chairside milling unit)? 41 base: 570 cases total sample still analyzing the practices clusters, we have perceived some other patterns regarding comfort with cad-cam technologies. those with a higher number of consultations per week, specially those with a monthly expenditure with consumables above brl 1,500 feel more comfortable with the technologies. random sample position regarding cad-cam technologies what is your position regarding cad-cam technologies (particularly, intraoral scanning and chairside milling unit)? 42 base: 570 cases total sample analyzing from the practices management point of view, in their majority, practices with a business plan, knowledge of work hour and their costs and profit margins, are inclined to be more comfortable and closer to cad-cam technologies. random sample influence of cad-cam technology to perform the prosthesis how do you think the cad-cam technologies (particularly, intraoral scanning and chairside milling unit) will affect the way protheses are made in brazil? 43 base: 481 cases excluded orthodontists random sample it is interesting to notice how most interviewees stated that new digital technologies will replace traditional prostheses. in the analysis of respondents' profiles, it is noticed that among practices with mostly a and b classes patients, the perception that cad-cam will replace traditional prostheses is higher than in other clusters. influence of cad-cam technology to perform the prosthesis how do you think the cad-cam technologies (particularly, intraoral scanning and chairside milling unit) will affect the way prostheses are made in brazil? 44 base: 481 cases excluded orthodontists among the clusters of number of consults, prints and monthly expenses, the respondents show themselves to be coherent with the national average as for their perception of the future of cad- cam technology in prostheses. random sample offer of cad-cam prostheses directly or through a laboratory, do you offer to your patients indirect restorations / prosthesis made with cad-cam technology? 45 base: 570 cases total sample analyzing the penetration of cad-cam technologies in demographic clusters, we see between the age clusters a similar penetration, however between the clusters of number of chairs and social class, we perceive a slight penetration of frequently and regularly among practices with more than two chairs and in office where most patients belong to a and b classes. random sample offer of cad-cam prostheses directly or through a laboratory, do you offer to your patients indirect restorations / prosthesis made with cad-cam technology? 46 base: 570 cases total sample in production and service clusters, we perceive small trends very similar to the national average between all clusters, with a slight exception of practices with monthly expenses above brl 1,500, which are inclined to offer cad- cam restorations and prostheses more frequently. random sample offer of cad-cam prostheses directly or through a laboratory, do you offer to your patients indirect restorations / prosthesis made with cad-cam technology? 47 base: 570 cases total sample in the practice management cluster, the trends are also very similar to the national average between all the clusters. the two differentiating parameters are, certainly, the presence of a business plan and the presence of a prosthesis technician in the office. random sample offer of cad-cam prostheses and how do you do it? 48 base: 239 cases cad-cam users considering that only 42% of the sample offers cad-cam prostheses and that 4.7% of these have a chairside, it is calculated that there is less than 2% of cad-cam in brazil. random sample offer of cad-cam prostheses and how do you do it? focus on cad-cam users 49 base: 239 cases cad-cam users among the management indicators, we see a relatively higher average penetration of cad-cam equipment installed among practices with a business plan. such phenomenon can be indicative of a correlation between the maturity of management of a practice and the purchase of a cad-cam equipment. random sample brand awareness analysis cad-cam equipment 51 glossary unaided awareness represents the whole set of brands of a given product family that is recalled by the interviewed sample. within the borders of unaided awareness, the consumer decides reasonably to make a purchase. top of mind it is the first brand mentioned by the interviewee, related to a given product family. it is the closest indicator of \"intention to buy\" or of the current use of the products and is strictly linked to the brand's value. prominence index it is the relationship between top of mind and unaided awareness; it is an indicator of awareness quality and estimates the brand's ability to represent the product family to those who know it, regardless their global awareness. relevance index it is the relationship between unaided awareness and recalled awareness. it defines the brand's ability to be recalled whenever the customer decides to make a purchase. cad-cam manufacturers: unaided awareness which manufacturers (cad-cam) of intraoral scanner and chairside milling unit come to your mind? 52 base: 570 cases total sample the comparison between unaided awareness and top of mind highlights relevant differences in the prominence index, in which a higher value indicates the brand's capacity to represent a products family. 13% of dentists know sirona as a brand, but only 11% of them know it to the point of mentioning it as first brand. the prominence index represents the average number of brands mentioned by each interviewee: the sum of percentage is 127%, i.e., in average, each dental office mentions more than 1 brand. random sample cad-cam manufacturers: total awareness do you know any of these brands? 53 base: 570 cases total sample the relevance index is important because it highlights the ability of a brand to be spontaneously recalled by interviewees, therefore, potentially when they need to make a purchase decision. in this preparation, statements that bring the product's name instead of the brand were expressed in this analysis (for instance: cerec, that obtained 4% of spontaneous notoriety, was summed to sironia's spontaneous notoriety). random sample relevance (strength of the brand in the category) prominence (capacity to represent the product category) + + cad-cam manufacturers: relevance vs. prominence do you know any of these brands? 54 base: 570 cases total sample the map of relevance/prominence highlights the brand's capacity to come to the dentist's mind when talking about a given product category (relevance) and the brand's ability to be mentioned spontaneously first (prominence). in the b2b market, prominence is closely linked to the use of product. therefore, in the upper right side of the map there are brands with above average ability to be recalled spontaneously and more frequently than average. in the upper left side there are brands with an above average ability to be recalled spontaneously, but with less frequency than the average are mentioned as the first brands. in the lower right side of the map there are brands with a lower than average ability to be recalled, but compared to the average, they are more frequently recalled as first brands. these are brands more recalled by their users, in their majority. amann girrbach has a low brand notoriety, but may be a future competitor to sirona in cad-cam equipment. planmeca is in a niche (almost elite) position, and if it improves its communication strenght, it may earn a relevant position in the digital technolgies world. random sample recommendation to colleagues cad-cam brands correlation analysis the correlation analysis is a technique that helps to identify and to measure the influence of independent variables (in this case, current and former users) over the dependent one (in this case, overall satisfaction). it was used to quantify the ratio between score and individual factors and evaluation over recommendation. therefore, it is possible to retrieve an \"importance hierarchy\" of individual demonstrations and to show them in a chart and, then, in a map. the vertical axis always shows the rating that the different instructions have received, in an average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence over the global recommendation. thus, we get an \"estimated importance\" of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a little different of that explicitly declared. the analysis of each factor's weigh, and not only the stated importance, allows some interesting considerations. the items have a different meaning according with the viewpoint with which they are considered: 56 statistical grade recommendation before the whole market: here we can emphasize some prerequisites (each upper right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors are before the market), some key factors to success (lower right corner of the map, where the companies are not always able to be recommended regarding strategical matters), and indifference areas (lower left corner), that constitute waste/inefficiency areas when a company decides to invest in such items belonging to the upper left corner of the map, since they are prone to meet the market, but they really do not affect the overall recommendation. recommendation regarding a specific company: here the scheme is the same, but the strong points are highlighted in the upper right corner of the map, where we can establish the inefficiency or low differentiation when placed in the left side of the map. in the lower right corner we can notice an improvement area, where we can meet the weak points of a given company. ranking of items - recommendation to colleagues ranking of hierarchy of importance of items. whole sample 57 in the charts at the side are represented the weight of the items over brand recommendation. the items reliable, makes day-by-day easier and innovative and avant- garde are the items with higher impact in overall recommendation. items related with the price have lower global influence over the recommendation. for those who already have a cad-cam equipment (fundamental opinion), the quality-price relationship results to be less important. weight per item on the recommendation score focus on the mean not significant whole sample (255 quotes) weight on the recommendation items score + + ranking of items - recommendation to colleagues how much worth individual items on recommendation? whole sample vs. sirona users 58 whole sample (255 mentions) in the lower right part there are items which are very relevant to overall recommendation but have a much lower score than the average. in the upper right part there are items which are very relevant to overall recommendation but have a much higher score than the average. pillars of brand image construction positioning drivers 59 factorial analysis aims to synthesize data, summarizing information contained in many variables in some synthetical factors. the purpose is to identify an underlying structure to a set of observed variables and to resume this substructure with a reduced number of main variables. whole sample the reduction of factors allows to individuate the main positioning drivers and to make some considerations: product / service: this factor is characterized by components related to the products performance features and a series of elements related to the service. it should be noticed that \"reliable\" is an ambivalent 2-factors item, since it reflects a meaning that is connected either to product reliability or to brand confidence. brand: includes all items related with brand reputation and its importance in the market, also in the international level. convenient: includes items that express a concept of convenience and good cost-benefit relationship. expensive: contains a single item that rates the brand as very expensive. this factor appears completely isolated of others, as we will see from the multiple regression analysis, its influence over a brand recommendation will prove not to be statistically significant. product / service brand convenient expensive make the daily practice easier 0,844 cutting edge and innovative 0,768 trustworthy 0,526 0,521 customer service oriented 0,522 well renowned brand 0,837 leading company in the segment 0,793 easy procurement 0,874 good value/price ratio 0,735 too expensive 0,968 the weight of pillars in the recommendation for colleagues recommendation factors 60 recommendation total 49% 22% product / service convenient 30% brand in general terms, the items related with the \"product / service\" factor are dominant in the determination of recommendation, corresponding almost to half of total. the brand component is the second to be considered in the determination of recommendation, though for a considerable distance. finally, convenient\" represents 22% in the determination of recommendation. the last factor, expensive, emerges in the analysis as not significant: while the convenience, regardless having a lower weight than other factors, is still one of the determinants' for recommendation, i.e., the fact that the brand is expensive does not affect brand recommendation. the regression analysis is a multivaried statistical technique, whose main goal is to discover the existing relationship between one target variable (dependent variable, in this case, recommendation) and a set of independent variables (each unique factor derived from factorial analysis). thus, trying to understand and to foresee the behavior of the target variable according with changes in independent variables. one of the main focus of multiple regression is to evaluate how much part of the dependent variable (recommendation) is explained by independent variables, in other words, how much these factors influence the behavior of a dependent variable. in order to complete the factorial analysis, it is important to also evaluate the weight of these factors on the overall recommendation, in order to understand if the improvement in one of the factors may also improve the likelyhood of a brand to be recommended. the figure r2=0.395 means that about 40% of the recommendation is explained and based on these factors: expensive not significant whole sample the weight of pillars in the recommendation for colleagues recommendation factors 61 the chart shows how the recommendation is made for the general sample and for the owners of a cad-cam equipment. compared with what was seen in the factorial analysis, where the price was a secondary element in brand awareness, when data is correlated with the inclination to recommend the brand to a colleague, the price comes out of variables considered, and it becomes a non-relevant element for the recommendation. those who already have a cad-cam equipment, present significant differences compared to the whole sample: in this case, actually, the convenience\" factor also becomes not significant for recommendation purposes, but the items that make up the item \"product / service\" seem to be very relevant for more than half of the inclination to recommend the brand. whole sample buying intention cad-cam buying intention are you willing/interested in buying an intraoral scanner to make digital prints or a cad-cam chairside milling unit within 2 years? excluding specialized orthodontics practices. 63 base: 498 cases non owners random sample the buying intention certainly yes of 5% is reduced to 4.5% including orthodontists. for respondents who claimed not to have a cad-cam equipment in their office, their future purchase intention was consulted. on the other hand, practices that already have 2 or more chairs are inclined to be more disposed to purchase. between clusters related to the patient's social class, the interest is predominantly averse, with the exception of practices with customers of a and b classes, that in 50% of answers showed to be willing to acquire a cad-cam equipment buying intention are you willing/interested in buying an intraoral scanner to make digital prints or a cad-cam chairside milling unit within 2 years? excluding specialized orthodontics practices. 64 base: 498 cases non owners as a trend, the practices with more consults and prints are more prone to be interested in buying a cad- cam equipment in the next two years. random sample buying intention are you willing/interested in buying an intraoral scanner to make digital prints or a cad-cam chairside milling unit within 2 years? excluding specialized orthodontics practices. 65 base: 498 cases non owners following the trend of owners, those with a business plan, costs knowledge and profits have higher likelyhood of buying a cad-cam equipment in the near future. random sample buying intention: probably/certainly not why probably/certainly not? 66 base: 308 cases not interested the price is the most important parameter of resistance for the purchase of an equipment. -the price problem is strongly felt in so paulo (62%) with the increase of age, the issue of price loses importance (35% for those who are more than 50 years old). -when a dentist already uses frequently the technology (through a laboratory) and feels comfortable with it, having no intention to invest in the future, it is almost exclusively because of the cost. -when we see resistance to the purchase between potential profiles (many prostheses, many implants, larger revenue, etc.), the reason, most times, is high price, not low demand. *this first analysis should be understood in qualitative terms, specially, we will afterwards investigate the buying behavior with structured matters that allows a more rigorous analysis. random sample buying intention: probably/certainly yes why probably/certainly yes? 67 base: 190 cases potentially interested among the main factors indicated as a reason for a potential purchase, are justified related factors the improvement of quality and final result, followed by innovation. *this issue should be understood mostly in quality terms, we will afterwards see the buying behavior with structured matters that allows a more rigorous analysis. random sample buying intention: intra-oral scanner or cad-cam milling unit do you think about buying only the scanner or also the mill? 68 base: 190 cases potentially interested among those who think about futurely investing in cad-cam technology, half of them thinks about buying a chairside. random sample buying intention: intraoral scanner which intraoral scanner brands you should evaluate to buy? 69 base: 185 cases potentially interested regardless the high number of respondents that claim not to know which brand to evaluate for a possible purchase, among the brands mentioned to be evaluated for a possible buy of intraoral scanner sirona is predominant. it is interesting to notice that in 4% of cases, the name cerec came out spontaneously. random sample buying intention: cad-cam chairside milling unit which cad-cam milling units brands you should evaluate to buy? 70 base: 90 cases potentially interested for chairside the percentage of does not know is even higher, getting to 82%. the 16% of respondents are interested in evaluating sirona and cerec, again considering 3% of the cases where cerec was mentioned. random sample demand of other services what should the supplier (manufacturer) of cad-cam (intraoral scanner and chairside milling unit) technologies offer to improve or enhance the way how you make restorations and prostheses in your practice? 71 base: 570 cases total sample a manufacturer will have to clearly support the users of digital technology, in terms of training and information, being one of the factors that dentists expect from a cad- cam manufacturer. the training factor (transversal in all segments) is followed by financial factors, such as better financing purchases and facilitation of shared purchase. in this case, the financial factors weigh as less important for the older dentists, and weigh for larger and more performing practices. random sample some conclusions 72 the world of users, in this moment, is concentrated in an elite, but it is foreseen an increase of target clients, even if with a low profile in terms of status. the reasons for purchase were made in a spontaneous and guided manner, and there are four main reason for the purchase: productivity quality of the result independence of the laboratory innovation the main reasons for purchases in the guided inquiry highlight three important drivers: orientation to the future added value to the own value independence these different drivers are relative to different kinds of clients, particularly, those more oriented to the economic management and less interested with independence and added value. those oriented to independence and to the future present a less rational profile. the emotional/impulsive purchase showed to be very strong with the pioneers in the use of cad-cam technology; satisfaction is strongly conditioned to the initial formation and after sales service. some conclusions 73 the aspects of costs are relevant in the pre-sale, but they do not show to be relevant after the equipment purchase and possible repurchase almost 50% of the sample feels uncomfortable and away from the cad-cam world, specially those who have patients of middle/low classes and with low volume of procedures. regardless the 50% that claim to be away from technology, only 11% claim that technology will not play an important role in the future. less than 2% of the practices in brazil have a chairside unit only about 3% of practices have an intraoral scanner. sirona is spontaneously the most known brand in the cad-cam world, but more than 80% of the sample cannot mention spontaneously a cad-cam manufacturer brand; almost half dentists claim not to know that sirona is a cad-cam manufacturer; sirona brand image in the cad-cam world is much superior between users in terms of those who know it but do not use it. it means that in the market of non-users, sirona has an image position not above the competition. in the process of recommendation to the colleagues, for cad-cam users, aspects regarding the service and proximity the client, which still seem to be in need, are much relevant; in the recommendation process, economical aspects have no weight for those who already are users. about 5% of the dentists interviewed claimed to be willing to invest in cad-cam technology in the next two years, as can be seen in the next slide. buying intention: summary 74 the world of current owners of cad-cam technology is, without question, made up of \"pioneers\" who clearly have a much higher production level of its media. those who answered certainly yes about the intention of buying and identified strong potential clients are absolutely characterized by two drivers: at least brl 40,000 per month in revenue; clients portfolio made up of at least 50% of high middle class (a/b class) current owners\" are specially younger, have relatively new practices but, in the future, they will have potential clients over 50 years and practices established in previous years. the potential market for the next 02 years, if the demand is encouraged correctly, it will be the double of the number of pieces of equipment installed today. the scanner to chairside milling unit ratio, as stated, is about 2 for analyzing a potential of 3,000 new practices that could accelerate pace, it possible foresee at least 1,000 new pieces of equipment to be sold in the next two years. potential market calculation based on the sample profile disregarding the buying intention presented 90,000 practices brazil* number of practices based on the number of dentists per practices 280,000 dentists in brazil 35% of the public system or inactives 186 thousand active private dentists 2,1 dentists per practice: source: cfo revenue > brl 35k (19.4%) clients portfolio made up of at least 50% of high middle class (a/b class) (26.1%) potential market 8,2% 7,380 practices 90.000 practices in brazil presence of favorable attitude characteristics; 6,2 % presence of two or more profile drivers. core target 2% 1,800 practices = revenue > brl 35k a / b class patients business plan technicians in the practice accessible potential market 8,2% 7,380 practices accessible potential market 8,2% 7,380 practices 90.000 practices brazil core target 2% 1.800 clinics italy: torino - roma +39 011 3119430 +39 011 3118669 www.key-stone.it key-stone@key-stone.it powered by",

    "text": "august 2024 ios report quantitative research methodology 2 3 premises and main objectives objectives the quantitative phase covered: target profiling (socio-demographics of owners, practice type, size, specialization, geography) measurement of strengths and criticalities of the concept acceptance of proposed pricing and its impact on purchase intention the research was carried out exclusively on dentists interested in purchasing an ios in the near future, drawing from two different basins: non-owners who are planning to purchase a scanner for the first time, and owners who already own at least one scanner but would like to purchase another one (either as a replacement or in addition to the one they already own). this research is not intended to measure the potential market but to evaluate the satisfaction and purchase intention for the sirios scanner, also providing insights on pricing and suggestions for communication. the quantitative survey has been performed on 371 dentists owners/non-owners/prospects of ios randomly selected from fully representative sample of gps from key-stone data bases in france, italy and spain. the interviews were conducted online (cawi) in july 2024, the collected data was processed using excel and spss. based on the objectives and question types, the analyses were carried out using the most modern and appropriate statistical techniques and methodologies. 4 methodology and statistical note glossary the confidence level indicates the reliability of the research. for example, a confidence level of 95% means that the phenomenon identified by the research is certain in 95% of cases. the confidence interval indicates how much the research data may deviate from reality. in the current study, with a 95% confidence level, the maximum error (confidence interval) is +/- 5,1%. the sample (thus the survey) does not represent the overall market but rather the segment of those who intend to purchase an ios device executive summary 5 6 executive summary sample segmentation: implant users implantology is a common practice in most dental clinics, with greater specialization in france. spain has a high proportion of intensive implant users, indicative of a well- developed market. although the sample of potential intraoral scanner buyers is not representative of the entire implantology market, it is useful for evaluating the value proposition of the new scanner compared to the leading brands. sample segmentation: aligners users in france, orthodontics, and specifically aligners, is a niche market due to regulatory factors. this data helps evaluate the use of aligners in italy and spain and is valuable for analyzing related responses. align technology, dentsply sirona, and straumann are key players in the scanner market, with their customers analyzed for differences in purchasing behavior and perception. new prospects profile among potential buyers of intraoral scanners, nearly 40% are potential future owners, 45% are current owners looking to purchase another scanner, and 16% own multiple scanners but plan to acquire more. in spain, there is a higher proportion of non-owners considering a purchase (50%), while in italy, there are more scanner owners among potential buyers. non-owners are also more common among those over 54 years old and in smaller practices. sample segmentation: consumable customers to separately evaluate the results for straumann customers, a statistically significant segment was created by grouping users of straumann, neodent, anthogyr implants, and clearcorrect. the analysis also revealed that customers of dentsply sirona (implants and aligners) and invisalign users are statistically relevant segments. the sample segmentation identified customers of three companies (align technologies, straumann, and dentsply sirona) whose statistical representativeness is sufficient to analyze potential differences in purchasing behavior perception. drivers of choice the most important factors in choosing an intraoral scanner include high reading accuracy, scan resolution, and affordable price. in france, economic accessibility is less of a priority, but product training is highly valued. in spain, affordability and flexible scanning are crucial, while wireless charging is appreciated in both italy and france. compatibility with invisalign: concerns and priorities compatibility with invisalign has emerged as a significant concern in focus groups. among the 15% who consider compatibility with aligners important, two-thirds specifically value compatibility with invisalign, indicating that 60% of those who view \"compatibility with clear aligners\" as important see it as a major issue. this translates to 9% of the overall sample. this concern is less pronounced in france due to a more specialized market, while in italy and spain, where the market is broader, the concern is around 9-10%. among ios owners, 10% consider compatibility with invisalign crucial, compared to 7% of non-owners. 7 executive summary ios: limits and barriers among those who do not own a scanner, 30% cite excessive cost as a major issue. internet connectivity and digital reliability are minor concerns. price sensitivity varies by country: 20% in france view price as a significant barrier, while nearly 50% in spain see it as such. full arch scanning is less problematic in france but more relevant in spain. in spain, team mindset and compatibility with laboratories are also significant concerns, along with some issues related to compatibility with aligner brands. usefulness of ios the perceived usefulness of the scanner is high in all analyzed situations, with particular emphasis on time optimization, clinical effectiveness, and internal planning. in spain, the scanner is considered less useful for time optimization compared to other countries, while in italy it is positively evaluated across all areas. in france, the focus is primarily on optimization and clinical effectiveness, with less attention given to communication and marketing. differences between owners and non-owners are evident, especially regarding the use for communication and marketing. segmentation 8 before addressing the questions related to purchasing behavior and the evaluation of the new straumann proposal, some information is provided regarding possible useful segmentation parameters, particularly related to the use of implants and aligners. eventual statistical significance will be highlighted according this segmentation parameters. 9 segmentation parameters 121 cases 123 cases 127 cases the main segmentation parameters related to the structures (center size, number of dentists, and year of establishment) and the respondent (age and any specializations) have been considered in the analysis of the results. *the total number of dentists is obtained by adding the number of full-time dentists and the number of part-time dentists calculated at 33%. 29% over 54 up to 44 from 44 to 54 31% 40% age mean: 51 56% over 3 up to 2 3 24% 20% number of chairs mean: 3 19% 2003-2013 2014-now bfr 2003 44% 36% year of opening mean: 2002 19% over 2 1 up to 2 44% 36% number of dentists* mean: 2 implants users this is a specific sample of potential ios buyers and therefore is not representative for conducting an analysis of the implantology market. however, it is very useful for cross-referencing data related to the value proposition of the new scanner concerning the main brands being used. straumann and dentsply sirona implant customers has been highlighted because both companies offer their own ios and are multi-brand. 10 how many implants do you approximately place in a year in your dental practice? which implant brands do you use in order of importance in your dental practice? base: 371 (total sample) fr it es 30% 21% 15% 15% 13% 15% 19% 7% 14% 12% 9% 5% 17% 4% 21% 15% 2% 10% 3% 8% 1%

practiced in almost every dental practice except france the research shows that implantology is practiced in almost all dental practices, except in france (greater specialization). in spain, there is a higher proportion of heavy implant users (highly developed implantology market). in france, orthodontics specifically aligners, represent still a niche market (mainly due to regulatory reasons). on the contrary aligners are extensively used in italy and spain. while these data are not intended for an analysis of the aligner market, they are very useful for profiling the subsequent responses related to this topic. align technology, dentsply sirona, and straumann are the three largest groups among companies that offer scanners, making it important to analyze any differences in purchase behavior and perception among their respective customers. aligners users 11 how many aligners do you approximately place in a year in your dental practice? which aligner brands do you use in order of importance in your dental practice? base: 371 (total sample) fr it es 52% 61% 74% 11% 7% 21% 9% 4% 11% 15% 5% 6% 3% 7% 5% 16% 1% 7% 2% 1% 4% 6% 5% other mentioned brands account for 21% (fr: 25%; it: 31%; es: 8%) of the responses provided and comprise 27 brands aligner treatment in france affects only a niche of dental practices consumable customer segmentation 12 base: 371 (total sample) opinions and behaviors of customers of consumable products and services from align technologies, straumann, and dentsply sirona can be analyzed separately with the intention to separately evaluate the results of straumanns customers, users of straumann, neodent, and anthogyr implants, as well as clearcorrect, were grouped together. this allowed for the definition of a statistically significant segment of 89 cases. during the analysis, it was noted that dentsply sironas customers (implants and aligners) also represent a statistically significant segment, as do the 171 invisalign users. the segmentation questions conducted on the sample allowed for the identification of customers from three companies, whose statistical representativeness is considered sufficient to attempt to identify potential differences in purchase behavior perception. for convenience, these three companies are referred to in the charts with the following abbreviations: align technologies (alt), straumann (str), and dentsply sirona (ds). this segmentation explicitly excludes owners of itero or dentsply sirona scanners because the same parameter cannot be used for straumann, which has not yet been mentioned as a scanner brand (the 39 itero owners and 43 ds scanner owners were nonetheless isolated for possible considerations). ios penetration 13 prospective buyers from future and current owners 14 do you have intraoral scanners in your practice? base: 371 (total sample) across countries, there are no significant differences except in spain, where it was found a higher rate of non-owners who are considering a purchase: among the prospects in spain, non-owners make up 50%. in italy, those who already own a scanner have a greater presence. the proportion of non-owners among prospects is much higher among those over 54 and in smaller dental practices. the prospects can be categorized into two groups: potential future owners (about 40% of the sample) who don't own a scanner, and current owners (about 60% of the sample) who wish to purchase additional scanners. previous and recent surveys confirm that among repurchasers, 80% plan to add more while 20% plan to substitute the current technology. however, in practices with two or more scanners, the focus shifts toward replacing older scanners. this trend is influenced by the size of the dental practice and the age of their initial scanners. those who already own ios represent a highly relevant and strategic segment 61% of respondents own an ios scanner owner prospects 39% of respondents are prospects non-owner prospects ios owner prospects: period of purchase 15 what is the year of purchase of your intraoral scanner? base: 227 (respondents who have ios) the market potential of those who already own a quite recent ios should not be overlooked, but price sensitivity is a discriminant factor focusing on prospects who already own scanners (repurchasers), it was observed that over 70% of the sample has made a recent purchase, indicating a strong likelihood of intending to buy additional machines. however, it is important not to overlook the impact of pricing strategies in italy and spain, where aggressive bundling offers (especially in spain) and significant tax incentives (in italy) starting at the end of 2020 have driven prices down significantly (on average, reducing the investment by 50% compared to the supplier's agreed price, with reductions of nearly 90% in southern italy due to a second tax incentive). this trend of paying a very reduced price for scanners in recent years, due to commercial or fiscal reasons, has influenced the price perception, particularly among those who already own scanners, especially if they purchased them recently. this information was gathered to assess potential differences in behavior and evaluations of straumann's scanner value proposition. hence, the purpose of this data analysis is to provide new insights when examining purchase behavior and value propositions. owners only ios owner prospects: installed brands considering only the prospects intending to make a purchase, it is interesting to evaluate purchasing behavior and the assessment of straumann's value proposition based on the brands already owned. it was found a strong presence of medit in france and a significant presence of align technology in spain: these are two factors to be considered. it is also noteworthy that 3shape is more prevalent among the younger audience. given the number of cases, this analysis is not an evaluation of the installed base of equipment but aims to identify those who own specific brands to see if they have different purchasing intentions and if they evaluate straumann's value proposition differently compared to those using other brands. 16 what

respondents are shown. these are actual \"prerequisites. flexible scanning and wireless charging, two of the strengths of straumann's value proposition, are mentioned by fewer respondents, but those who do mention them place significant importance. these are features that are not widely known or prevalent but could be strong differentiators if properly communicated.",

base: 371 (total sample) main decision-drivers in choosing a scanner show differences in the three countries focus on compatibility with clear aligners 20 how important is compatibility specifically with invisalign for you? base: 55 (respondents who choose compatibility with clear aligners) country since the issue of compatibility with invisalign emerged during the focus groups, an analysis was conducted of those who identified aligner compatibility as important when choosing a scanner. of this 15%, two-thirds specifically value compatibility with invisalign. therefore, for 60% of those who answered compatibility with clear aligners\" to the previous question, this is a significant issue, likely a barrier. recalculating the weight of these respondents, it was found that for 9% of the overall sample, this is a highly relevant issue. it is a less significant concern in france, where there are fewer aligner users due to a more specialized market, while in italy and spain, where the market is more generalist, the percentage is around 9-10%. among ios owners, the percentage of those who consider compatibility with invisalign to be crucial is 10% of the overall sample, compared to 7% of non-owners. important factors when choosing a scanner the \"insurmountable\" barrier of incompatibility with invisalign affects 9% of the sample 21 how useful do you consider the use of an intraoral scanner in the following situations?

base: 144 (respondents who do not have ios) backwardness: this driver encompasses elements that seem unrelated and may appear trivial, but from the researchers' perspective, it represents a single driver of justifications rooted in biases rather than real issues. expensiveness: the problems in this area are related to convenience, where excessive investment is predominant, but also include concerns about technology evolution, although with a low correlation, and model printing. resistance to change: this area encompasses issues related to mindset, in particular potential biases and prejudices from both dentists and their laboratories. compatibility: this factor includes aspects related to compatibility with certain software or aligner systems. full arch issues: the issues falling under this factor are related to full arches, including aspects related to the ergonomics of the handpiece and long working times. non-owners only drivers of resistance the resistances are grouped into subjective and objective drivers cross loading: when certain items are present in two factors, it means that they partially contribute to both drivers. the numerical values refer to the degree of correlation (mean 0, variance +/-1). 27 barriers for non-owner prospects factor analysis how much do you consider the following aspects an obstacle to adopting an intraoral scanner in your practice? base: 144 (respondents who do not have ios) regarding the countries, france exhibits more issues related to biases and stereotypes, which likely indicate a considerable resistance to change. on the other hand, italy and spain show statistically significant data (with opposing opinions) regarding the factor of expensiveness: italian dentists do not place much importance on this factor, in contrast to spanish dentists, for whom price-related issues are of great significance. in spain, compatibility also emerges as a relevant issue, but it should be noted that the large share of invisalign aligners and itero scanners undoubtedly influences this perception. it is worth noting that respondents aged 45 to 54 assign greater importance to the top three factors; this is a target group of affluents who have not yet made a purchase but feel they must do so. dentists over the age of 54 place little weight on all factors in general (it is possible that some aspects related to older respondents have not been investigated). dental practices with more than three chairs significantly evaluate issues of compatibility and full-arch prosthetics. each factor has an average of 0, so by analyzing the average scores on individual cases, it is possible to statistically measure and visually observe the differences in the evaluation of each driver compared to the mean (horizontal axis). the factors help to highlight the differences and to profile the various segments non-owners only key-stone srl all rights reserved. this document is protected by copyright.",

    "text": "clinical - europe 2015 index 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 introduction scenario brand awareness brand positioning brand numeric distribution and intention to buy satisfaction analysis and loyalty metrics 7 customer satisfaction in-depth analysis introduction the number of interviews performed for this research is 1.000 dental practices; and it is fully representative of the population of the european dental practices. the interviews were performed between july and september of 2015 through a cati system made by our team of specialists. 4 introduction the ominivision digital europe 2015 is an omnibus multiclient descriptive research, analyzing the performances in europe of the main international manufacturers both in clinic and laboratories markets evaluated with regard to the new digital technologies, such as intraoral scanners, chairside milling (clinical), table top scanners, in lab milling and 3d printing (laboratories). with the amount of 1.000 dental practices interviewed; the sample and its results fully represent the population of the european dental practices. with a confidence level of 95% the maximum error (confidence interval) is +/- 3,5%. the data was processed using excel, spss, statistica. due to the objectives of knowledge and the types of questions, the data was processed: contingency tables significance test glossary the confidence level indicates the reliability level of the research. for example, a confidence level equal to 95% means that the phenomenon pointed out by the research is correct for the 95% of the cases. the confidence interval indicates how much the research data diverge from reality. as the sample results, even if representative, cannot be perfectly correspondent to those obtainable interviewing the entire population, each research has an approximation degree which represents the maximum error of the research. for example, a confidence interval of 3% indicates that if the research phenomenon is equal to 60%, the result can change, in comparison with reality, of an extra 3% or a minus 3% and in this way it is included between 63% (60%+3%) and 57% (60%-3%). . 5 introduction - statistical note introduction - sample composition 1/2 6 country weighted cases % germany 333 33% france 191 19% italy 261 26% spain 136 14% united kingdom 80 8% total 1.000 100% the weight has been calculated considering the distribution of the dental practices in europe. the sample consists of 1000 dental practices, stratified by nielsen areas. the number of interviews conducted in each country were about 200, but in order to accurately represent the market made up of the investigated countries, the cases have been properly weighted. please, refer to the next slide for the details of the weighting process. introduction - sample composition 2/2 7 the number of interviews conducted in each country were about 200 as shown here on the right (a). the weight of the surveyed countries regarding the dental practices is shown at (b). the overall results (only the overall ones) must be representative of the total universe (all countries investigated) which the sample refers to, as if we were to interview the whole universe. if we assume that the number of dental practices is a reliable indication of the weight of a given country, we need to make sure that each countrys sample weights as much as the number of the surgeries for that country, out of the total evaluated countries. in this case, since the natural weight of the interviews in each country is different from the weight of the parameter considered, we have to apply a multiplying factor (it can be more or less than 1) to the number of performed interviews in each country, so that, only for the overall results, the weighted interviews are consistent with the parameter used. the resulting number of weighted interviews is then shown at (c). it is important to underline that the weights are applied only when the overall results are considered. the charts showing the data of the single countries, are always referred to the actual interviews performed (a). country weighted cases % germany 333 33% france 191 19% italy

21,8 base: 1000 cases scenario note the scenario analysis will be carried out considering the overall sample and some clusters. country: the data are split by each investigated country. digital restoration provider: the data are split by different profiles, as follows. - digital restorations provider: yes / no. yes: all respondents stating to use digital technologies to provide restorations to their clients (even in full outsourcing). - technology: chairside milling (respondents stating to use chairside milling unit at their practice); scanner (respondents stating to use scanner to send scan files outside for milling); impression (respondents stating to send outside impressions for milling). - channel: manuf/milling center (respondents stating to send impressions and or scan files to a manufacturer/milling center); partner lab (respondents stating to send impressions and or scan files to a partner lab). scenario: number of dental technicians and laboratories do you have at least a technician at your practice? 10 base: 1000 cases germany shows a higher penetration of dental practices with technicians. scenario: number of dental technicians and laboratories do you have at least a technician at your practice? if yes, how many? 11 base: 149 cases mean: 1,6 1,4 1,6 2,0 2,0 1,4 it look like germany has a higher heterogeneity where theres a higher penetration of dental practices with technicians, but where the average number of technicians is lower. other countries information should be considered as an indication only. scenario: number of dental technicians and laboratories do you have at least a technician at your practice? if no, how many laboratories do you cooperate with? 12 base: 851 cases mean: 2,0 1,5 2,1 2,0 2,4 2,9 uk and spain are the countries that tend to be provided by more than one laboratory. this means that the competition between laboratories can be higher in those countries. scenario: use of digital technologies in practices do you provide your patients with indirect restorations performed with digital technologies? 13 base: 1000 cases in comparison to an overall mean of 32%, spain, italy and germany seem to be the countries where digital indirect restorations are performed the most. uk looks to be an important exception in comparison to the other countries do you provide your patients with indirect restorations performed with digital technologies? 14 base: 1000 cases scenario: use of digital technologies in practices despite a rather low penetration of the digital technologies france shows one of the highest percentages of regular use of it. scenario: digital technology use - breakdown by channel how do you provide digital restorations in your practice? 15 base: 323 cases the most frequent way to provide digital restorations is through the traditional channel, by sending the impressions or the scans to a dental lab or a manufacturer/milling center. 14% of providers of digital restorations do have a chairside milling. focus on digital restoration providers scenario: digital technology use - breakdown by channel how do you provide digital restorations in your practice? 16 base: 323 cases with regard to the analysis by channels, spain and france show the highest percentages of use of the manufacturer/milling center as the preferred channel, while italy shows the highest percentage of respondents owning a chairside milling unit. uk should be considered as an indication only, due to the reduced number of cases. focus on digital restoration providers scenario: digital technology use - breakdown by technology how do you provide digital restorations in your practice? 17 base: 323 cases with regard to the technologies, again the traditional method is the most used one (86%). about 20% of the respondents providing digital technologies use an intraoral scanner, while 14% do have a chairside milling. focus on digital restoration providers 11% is the percent of scanner owners, out of the total digital restorations providers, who use the scanner to send the files outside for milling. the total % of scanner owners, including those used with the in-lab milling units, is 20%. scenario: digital technology use - breakdown by technology how do you provide digital restorations in your practice? 18 base: 323 cases the analysis by country highlights italy as the country with the highest penetration of intraoral scanners users among digital restorations providers. uk should be considered as an indication only, due to the reduced number of cases. focus on digital restoration providers scenario: digital technology use - channels and technologies how do you provide digital restorations in your practice? 19 the chart allows to evaluate the percentage of users of different technologies, in comparison with the same technologies and the different channels used. please, see the example on the right. base: 323 cases for example, among those using a scanner to send outside the scans, 44% of them also have a chairside milling. for example, those sending their restorations to a partner lab, in 11% of the cases also send them to a manufacturer/milling center and in 7% of the cases they have a chairside milling. focus on digital restoration providers channels scenario: digital technology use - technologies and channels how do you provide digital restorations in your practice? 20 the chart allows to evaluate the percentage of users of different channels, in comparison with the same channels and the different technologies used. please, see the example on the right. base: 323 cases for example, among those sending the impressions outside, 4% of them also have a scanner and 5% of them also have a chairside milling. for example, those sending their restorations to a partner lab in 11% of the cases they also have a scanner and in 7% of the cases they have a chairside milling. focus on digital restoration providers technologies scenario: role of digital technologies on prosthetics in the future how do you feel the new digital technologies (cad-cam and 3d printing) will affect the way the prosthetics is carried out in your country? 21 base: 1000 cases its interesting to note how the majority of respondents declared the new digital technologies will play an important role but they will not replace the way the traditional restorations are performed. the highest percentage of respondents stating that digital technologies will replace the traditional restorations is in spain and italy, followed by france. scenario: role of digital technologies on prosthetics in the future how do you feel the new digital technologies (cad-cam and 3d printing) will affect the way the prosthetics is carried out in your country? 22 base: 1000 cases in the analysis by respondents profiles, the only relevant difference is between the digital restorations providers and the rest of the sample. the latter ones show the lowest percentage regarding digital technologies that will completely replace the traditional prosthetics. scenario: stance versus digital technologies what is your stance versus the digital technologies? 23 base: 1000 cases the sample is rather split between those trying to get closer to digital technologies and those feeling uncomfortable with them. the percentage of respondents using it and feeling comfortable with it, still are the minority at 13%. the highest percentages are in italy, spain and uk. scenario: stance versus digital technologies what is your stance versus the digital technologies? 24 base: 1000 cases its quite normal to find the respondents using a milling center to be perfectly accustomed to digital technologies, while the highest percentage of respondents feeling uncomfortable with them is related to respondents sending out their impression to third parties. scenario: role of dentists and technicians in the future how do you think dentists and technicians role will change with the new digital technologies? 25 base: 1000 cases about the future role of dentists and technicians in the new digital era, the majority of respondents is convinced that the cooperation will become tighter because of the high expertise of the technicians. the highest percentages are in germany and uk. scenario: role of dentists and technicians in the future how do you think dentists and technicians role will change with the new digital technologies? 26 base: 1000 cases the same feeling is widespread among the profiles analysed in this slide, where there are no relevant difference about this topic. on the other hand, its quite clear that dentists will need to get more expertise, due to the fact that they will be asked to perform part of the workflow currently performed by the technicians. scenario: change in the relationship among dentists, technicians, industry how do you think the relationship between dentists and technicians and the industry will change with the new digital technologies? 27 base: 1000 cases the major part of the quotes are in the direction of a tighter cooperation between dentists and technicians and between dentists and the industry, due to the increasing need for specific manufactured products that the manufacturers can provide. this stance is rather even among countries, with spain showing a higher feeling about the increase in the cooperation between dentists and the industry. scenario: change in the relationship among dentists, technicians, industry how do you think the relationship between dentists and technicians and the industry will change with the new digital technologies? 28 base: 1000 cases scenario: change in the way restorations are performed in your opinion, does the use of the digital technology change the type of restorations? 29 base: 1000 cases the sample is rather split evenly between those feeling the type of restorations will not change, and those thinking that there will be a change. the major differences come from germany and uk, where there are the major part of respondents stating there will be no change. scenario: change in the way restorations are performed in your opinion, does the use of the digital technology change the type of restorations? if yes , which way? please, answer with (not related, rather not related, neutral, rather related, totally related) to the following statements. 30 base: 469 cases the changes are mostly related the increased use of aesthetic materials and the increase of fixed prosthetics versus the mobile prosthetics. note the 5 possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores among the items. the clustering is the following: not related: the scores grouped in this cluster are not related, rather not related. neutral: the scores grouped in this cluster are neutral, rather related. totally related is shown without any grouping. scenario: required features from digital technology providers what should your digital technology provider offer you, to improve and enhance the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your practice? 31 base: 758 cases a provider will clearly need to give support to the users of the digital technology, in terms of training and information. frequently mentioned is also convenience. about 12% of respondents look for improved performances and again with 4% there is an item related to the support from the provider. it looks like two main drivers are present: convenience, also considering a return on investment and support (training and information).

    "text": "45 base: 758 quotes processing without don't know high reputation is the item that received the highest average scores, followed by reliable and trustworthy. the lowest scores come from affordable, too expensive and good price/quality ratio. as if the image of the brand in the digital world are is not associated with price related topics. note the 5 possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores among the items and the brands evaluated. the clustering is the following: not relevant: the scores grouped in this cluster are totally irrelevant, partially irrelevant, neutral. the other clusters quite relevant and totally relevant are related to the original answers without any grouping. brand positioning: sirona, kavo, 3m in your opinion, how do the brands that i am going to read out to you rate in the following areas? please rate them with totally irrelevant, partially irrelevant, neutral, quite relevant, totally relevant. 46 base: 326 quotes sirona kavo 3m processing without dont know base: 129 quotes base: 126 quotes brand positioning: overall in your opinion, how do the brands that i am going to read out to you rate in the following areas? 47 base: 326 quotes base: 129 quotes base: 126 quotes base: 170 quotes + mean score while sirona is rather on average, given the high number of quotes received, its interesting to note kavo performing better than the competitors with regard to affordability and customer service oriented, while 3m is more than other brands associated with too expensive and worldwide renowned. brand positioning: factor analysis 48 the reduction into factors allowed us to obtain 2 main drivers, nearness vs. reputation. they are very relevant in order to achieve a positioning analysis. this kind of analysis, has a relevant advantage: the here defined set of 2 drivers allows to design a positioning map, explained by the following slide. factor 1 (nearness) it is driven by items like affordability, customer service oriented, makes daily practice easier, clearly related to the nearness, whose concept is reinforced by reliability and good price quality ratio. factor 2 (reputation) it is driven by items clearly related to the reputation, such as leading company and worldwide renowned on top of all. too expensive may be part of the reputation as brand with high reputation are often seen as more expensive than the average. factor analysis its goal is to reduce the information contained in several variables by synthesizing a few factors. it aims to identify a substructure underlying a group of variables, and resume this substructure with a reduced number of latent variables. thanks to the factor analysis, some positioning drivers can be identified, that, as a matter of fact, represent the brand image analysed. two factors nearness reputation affordable 0,764 good price quality ratio 0,684 customer service oriented 0,633 makes daily practice easier 0,631 reliable 0,602 trustworthy 0,589 0,485 leading company 0,800 worldwide renowned 0,714 innovative and at the forefront 0,628 highly reputable 0,574 too expensive 0,353 brand positioning: positioning map 1 the map is an actual brand positioning one, as it shows how the different brands are seen, with regard to the factors identified, by the respondents. 49 the map is slightly on the lower side as sirona, which received most of the quotes, affects the map itself and determines the variance, with a central position. kavo is stronger in germany, while dentsply is stronger in uk. for the latter, its not sure if the image is strictly related to dentsply or degudent or atlantis. planmeca and carestream, although belonging to the digital technology world, partially due their positioning to their strong presence in the digital x-ray market. less relevant nearness more relevant less relevant reputation more relevant brand positioning: positioning map 2 this map analyses where some different profiles are positioned, if the nearness concept has an impact on the recommendation, or if the driving factor is the reputation. 50 the fact that some different profiles are closer than other (e.g. germany and >3 chairs) doesnt mean that those profiles are related to each other (i.e. its not said that german respondents have >3 chairs). france positioning is more related to immature markets, where the driving forces are more focused on the reputation, while the german market, more mature, is driven by the service components, so it is closer to the nearness concept. less relevant nearness more relevant less relevant reputation more relevant brand positioning: positioning map 3 51 in this map, some psychographic profiles are present. its interesting to see how the respondents close to the concept that digital technologies will not change dramatically the future of dentistry, and forecasting an overall increase in the cooperation among the different actors (dentists, laboratories and industry) are closer to a nearness concept. on the contrary, profiles more keen to think about a true change in dentistry, but far from a cooperation attitude, are closer to the reputation. less relevant nearness more relevant less relevant reputation more relevant brand image vs recommendation - correlation analysis 52 items score items weight on recommendation with the bivariate correlation analysis we try to understand how much the factors seen in the factor analysis influence the recommendation, by analysing the different weight that the single items composing the factors have on the recommendation. bivariate correlation analysis the bivariate correlation analysis is a technique that helps to identify and measure the influence of the independent variables (in this case, each brand positioning item) on the dependent one (in this case, the recommendation). the bivariate correlation analysis has been used to quantify the relation between the score on the single factors and the rating on the recommendation how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? brand image vs recommendation - correlation analysis map 53 the map is the visual results of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. on the horizontal axis there is the weight on the recommendation of each item, and on the vertical one theres the rating of each item. considering rather new and immature markets, its not rare to see the items related to the pricing in general not to be relevant in the recommendation process. (low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) the items on the upper right side of the map, very close one to each other, will be further investigated on the regression analysis, in order to evaluate their importance on the recommendation. brand image vs recommendation - correlation analysis ranking 54 focus on weight on recommendation when the analysis is performed on the ranking based on the weight that the different items have on the recommendation of the main brands, its interesting to note how not all items are relevant to all brands. this is the case of 3m, where several items are not relevant, while its recommendation looks to be more affected by the fact that it makes the daily practice easier, reliability, innovation and reputation. overall ranking sirona kavo 3m others trustworthy 1 3 1 n.a 1 reliable 2 2 2 2 3 highly reputable 3 1 5 n.a 7 makes daily practice easier 4 4 9 1 5 worldwide renowned 5 5 3 3 8 innovative and at the forefront 6 8 4 4 2 leading company 7 7 6 n.a 4 customer service oriented 8 6 7 n.a 6 good price quality ratio 9 9 8 n.a 9 affordable 10 10 10 n.a 10 too expensive 11 11 n.a. n.a n.a brand image - multiple regression analysis 55 its interesting to note how it looks like in the process of the recommendation both factors are almost equally involved and important. only in some clusters like dentsply brand, the nearness seems to have a higher weight in determining the recommendation. multiple regression analysis the regression analysis is a multi-variate statistical technique whose main aim is to find out the existing relationship between a target variable (dependent variable, in our case, the recommendation) and a group of independent variables (each single factor derived from the factor analysis). one of the main focus of the multiple regression is to assess how much part of the dependent variable (recommendation) is explained by the independent variables (corner stone factors of the recommendation which have been previously indicated: nearness, reputation), i.e. how much these factors are influencing the behavior of the dependent one. brand numeric distribution and intention to buy brand numeric distribution: intraoral scanner what intra oral scanner brand do you use?

correlation analysis the considerations coming from the bivariate analysis, allow us to highlight some important issues. the items have a different meaning according to the point of view with which they are considered: the satisfaction related to the whole market or the satisfaction related to a single product/brand. satisfaction related to a specific company/product here the scheme is the same, but we can highlight the strength points in the upper-right side of the map, which can determine inefficiency or low differentiation if placed in the left side of the map. in the lower-right we can note an improvement area, where we can find the weak points of a certain company. satisfaction related to the whole market here we can highlight some prerequisites (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors satisfy the market), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, where companies are not always able to satisfy customers with regard to strategic issues), and indifference areas (lower-left side of the map) which become waste/not efficient areas when a company decides to invest in those items belonging to the upper-left side of the map since, they tends to satisfy the market but they actually dont affect the overall satisfaction at all. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the overall satisfaction? 82 items satisfaction score items weight on overall satisfaction when assessing the weight of the different items on the overall satisfaction, the business support was found to be not very relevant and we decided to exclude it from the subsequent factor analysis. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis overall 83 (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) (low) satisfaction score (high) it is very interesting to see how the key components, being crucial in the determination of the overall satisfaction, all belong to service items and a crucial role is played by the running costs of the digital technologies, not properly related to the purchasing price. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis sirona 84 (low) satisfaction score (high) (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) sirona brand has a relevant role, as it is by far the most quoted brand and to a certain extent affects the overall analysis, most of all in the customer satisfaction. that is no surprise that several main components seen in the overall results are also present in this map. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis kavo 85 (low) satisfaction score (high) (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) kavo users feel the overall running costs not to be a crucial topic, but they are looking at softer items, like assistance and flexibility of the brand. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis 3m 86 (low) satisfaction score (high) (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) among the most crucial items there are the overall running costs and the technical assistance. the handiness and ease of use are also crucial items. customer satisfaction: factor analysis 87 the reduction into factors allowed us to obtain 4 main drivers, product and service quality, easy practice, management costs, compatibility. factor 1 (product and service quality) it is related to the intrinsic qualities of the product, (which in this case is very different from the usual analysis on consumable products) and to services strictly related to it. seldom is possible to see an item in the factor analysis which carries together items related to the product component and to the service as well. in this case, the technical assistance and the sw updates go hand in hand with the accuracy and the ease of use. factor 2 (easy practice) the second factor has some soft components related to the grade of availability the company has to make the daily practice easy in the use of the digital technologies. this is true, according to the results of this analysis, when a company gives support in starting up the digital business, when the company is available and flexible and a wide range of materials is available. all of that, makes a company look reliable as well. 4 factors product and service quality easy practice management costs compatibility technical support from the company 0,844 technical assistance in case of repair 0,810 accuracy and overall quality of the restorations 0,779 handiness / ease of use 0,778 frequency of sw updates from the company 0,729 start-up training 0,800 wide range of materials available 0,774 availability and flexibility of the company 0,672 reliability 0,552 cost of sw updates 0,822 overall running costs 0,605 compatibility with other brands 0,907 factor 3 (management costs) not to forget that the new digital technologies can be considered a business of the practice, so that the management costs are also important to make this business profitable for the practice. in this sense, the running costs and the cost for sw updates make a separate factor accounting for the overall satisfaction. this factor has not to be confused with the cost for acquiring a digital equipment, but clearly, the ordinary costs, sustained every year to run the digital business do have their own importance. factor 4 (compatibility) the fourth and last factor is strictly related to the compatibility of the system with other systems, which allows for a easy way to expand the business and meet the needs from the patients. an open systems surely helps the users to be more flexible and ready to face the different situations that digital restorations shows. customer satisfaction: multiple regression analysis 88 what seen in the factor analysis takes here an assessment with regard to the importance that the multiple regression analysis highlights the single factors may have in determining the overall satisfaction. the value of r2 is really high in this analysis (0,832), so that we are pretty sure that almost all satisfaction can be explained by the items contained in the factors here shown. the item with the most relevant importance looks to be product and service quality accounting for 43% of the total satisfaction. it is quite obvious to see this, as the list of items contained in this item are very important features (just like said before, they are related to both the product and the service), and the overall satisfaction cannot be considered regardless those items and, consequently, this factor. what strikes the attention the most is the third item management costs, which accounts for 26% and it is the second most important factor in the assessment of the overall satisfaction. it is clear how issues like cost of sw updates and more generally running costs are considered to be quite important. not far from the management costs factor, the third most important one is easy practice accounting for 21% of the overall satisfaction. the way a company helps professionals to get the digital business started in a easy and quick way, accounts for a relevant portion in assessing the overall satisfaction. (r2=0,832) overall satisfaction 43% 26% product and service quality management costs 21% easy practice compatibility 9% italy: torino - roma +39 011 3119430 +39 011 3118669 www.key-stone.it key-stone@key-stone.it powered by",

    "text": "omnivision digital europe 2015 summary published in march 2016 by key-stone s.r.l. 10095 grugliasco (to) | via s. doppi 20/b torino- italia key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 2 phone +39 011 3119430 foreword this document is an addendum to the overall report of the omnivision digital europe. the report aims to highlight the information about how dentists and dental technicians are dealing with the new dental digital technologies in europe. the goal is to understand the key aspects of the role of these new technologies in the offices and laboratories daily work and how the respondents feel about the digital dentistry today. introduction the first digital revolution in the dental market took place years ago with dental restorations such as veneers, inlays, crowns and bridges using dental cad-cam systems and new, improved systems appear on the market at very high growth rates. the dentistry market is currently experiencing a very exciting time for both dental practices, laboratory owners and professionals. new digital technologies, even if yet way behind compared with other areas such as engineering, medicine, biomedical, and others in terms of technologies, are being developed by the main manufacturers of the dental industry. the development of the digital technologies applied in dentistry will simplify the workflows and take the industry - that formerly existed on a purely analog environment - on another level in terms of production and automation. as the cost of a partner laboratory work is one of the major factor in dentistry, some partners laboratories and milling centers are adopting digital technologies in order to reduce costs and set themselves to another level of quality. in other hand, as laboratories and milling centers keep improving practices and procedures, the main manufacturers also keep investing in research and developing the next generation of products, systems, and technologies to meet the expectations and needs of the customers. this report and the information contained therein are believed to be accurate at the time of publishing. the information and data provided is not guaranteed in any way by key-stone or its analysts, managers, partners, agents or authors. this report, by default, carries a single license and is copyrighted. it should therefore not be copied or reproduced in any form, by any means, in part or in whole without a written permission from key-stone s.r.l. reproducing, photocopying or redistributing of this report or other reports from key-stone s.r.l. to other sites, facilities, units, divisions, affiliates or corporate offices of the purchasers organization is prohibited. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 3 methodology glossary the confidence level indicates the reliability level of the research. for example, a confidence level equal to 95% means that the phenomenon pointed out by the research is true at 95% of certainty. the confidence interval indicates how much the research data diverge from reality. as the sample results, even if representative, cannot be perfectly correspondent to those obtainable interviewing the entire population. each research has an approximation degree, which represents the maximum error of the research. for example, a confidence interval of 3% indicates that if the research phenomenon is equal to 60%, the result can change, in comparison with the reference universe, by an extra 3% or a minus 3% and in this way it is included between 63% (60% +3%) and 57% (60% -3%). sample composition the interviews were performed, between july and september of 2015, by our team of specialists, with the support of a cati system. the total number of interviews performed for this research is 1.000 dental practices and 722 dental laboratories. statistical note - dental practices confidence interval: 7,35% the number of interviews conducted in each country was about 200 as shown here at (a). the weight of the surveyed countries regarding the dental practices is shown at (b). the overall results (only the overall ones) must be representative of the total universe (all countries investigated) which the sample refers to, as if we were to interview the whole universe. if we assume that the number of dental practices is a reliable indication of the weight of a given country, we need to make sure that each countrys sample weights as much as the number of the surgeries for that country, out of the total evaluated countries. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 4 in this case, the natural weight of the interviews in each country is different from the weight of the parameter considered. therefore, we have to apply a multiplying factor (it can be more or less than 1) to the number of performed interviews in each country, so that, only for the overall results, the weighted interviews are consistent with the parameter used. the resulting number of weighted interviews is then shown at (c). it is important to underline that the weights are applied only when the overall results are considered. the charts showing the data of the single countries, are always referred to the actual interviews performed (a). statistical note dental laboratories confidence interval: 8,39% the number of interviews conducted in each country were about 150 as shown here at (a). the average weight of the surveyed countries was calculated considering two parameters: number of dental laboratories and business collected from a panel of major manufacturers in europe for the consumable market (the fast track analysis europe), shown at (b). key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 5 the overall results (only the overall ones) must be representative of the total universe (all countries investigated) which the sample refers to, as if we were to interview the whole universe. if we assume that the parameters considered (number of laboratories and fast track europe* business) are a reliable indication of the weight of a given country, we need to make sure that each countrys sample weights as much as the parameters indicated for that country, out of the total (number of laboratories and fast track business) evaluated countries. in this case, since the natural weight of the interviews in each country is different from the weight of the parameters considered, we have to apply a multiplying factor (it can be more or less than 1) to the number of performed interviews in each country, so that, only for the overall results, the weighted interviews are consistent with the parameters used. the resulting number of weighted interviews is then shown at (c). it is important to underline that the weights are applied only when the overall results are considered. the charts showing the data of the single countries, are always referred to the actual interviews performed (a).",

    "text": "role of digital technologies in the future chart influence of digital technologies on prosthetics performance europe vs. breakdown per country the predominant feeling is that the digital technologies will be important in the future, however they are not going to completely replace the traditional way. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 12 its interesting to note how the majority of respondents declared the new digital technologies will play an important role, in overall this feeling is true for 54% of respondents, but they will not replace the way the traditional restorations are performed. the highest percentage of respondents stating that digital technologies will replace most of the traditional restorations is in spain and italy, followed by france. the statement of those countries may have a correlation with use. this may mean that those countries using more digital technologies are more convinced than others that this technology will replace the traditional prosthesis. the feeling that the digital technologies will not replace completely the traditional prosthetics is almost the same among respondents not providing digital restorations, but is lower than average the percentage of responses related to the fact that the digital technologies will completely replace the traditional prosthetics (27% vs 31% overall). digital technology acceptance in dental offices stance versus digital technologies at this stage, the level of acceptance of the digital technologies was evaluated, with specific regard to how much the dentists feel comfortable with the new technologies. chart dental practices stance to digital technologies europe vs. breakdown per country the sample is rather split between those trying to get closer to digital technologies and those feeling uncomfortable with them. the percentage of respondents using it and feeling comfortable with it, still are the minority at 13%. the highest percentages are in italy, spain and uk. its interesting to correlate the digital technology penetration (chart digital technologies offer) with the stance. for example, germany has the second highest level of penetration (35% of the practices offer restorations with digital technologies) but respondents generally look to feel more uncomfortable with it (57% that feels uncomfortable using the technology versus 38% in overall). key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 13 relationship among dentists, technicians and the industry in the future of digital technologies besides the analysis on the current use and penetration of digital technologies, it is also interesting to investigate how the relationship among dentists, technicians, and the industry will progress and interact in the future, due to the relevant changes that the digital technologies may bring to their daily work. chart change in the relationship among dentists, technicians and the industry europe vs. breakdown per country the major part of the quotes is in the direction of a tighter cooperation between dentists and technicians and also between dentists and the industry, due to the increasing need for specific manufactured products that the industry can provide. the results also show that uk respondents firmly believe in a future strengthening of the relationship between dentists and technicians with 50% of quotes, versus 34% of the total sample. in other hand, the majority of the practices in germany (36% versus the overall average of 24%) believes that the relationship will become blander as they believe the process with cad-cam is easier and do not require a specific knowledge. chart change in the way restorations are performed - europe vs. breakdown per country key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 14 the sample is rather split evenly between those feeling the type of restorations will not change, and those thinking that there will be a change. the major differences come from germany and uk, where there are the major part of respondents stating there will be no change. it looks like the major changes brought by the digital technologies are mostly related to the material used (more use of zirconia and cocr instead of alloys) and the fact that there may be a higher production of fixed prosthetics instead of removable one. required features from digital technology providers chart what dentists expect from a digital technology provider, in order to improve and enhance the way they perform restorations and prosthetics - europe a manufacturer will clearly need to give support to digital technology users, in terms of training and information and in terms of improvement in the performance. an interesting assumption may be that the unfamiliarity is the driver making dentists to ask for training and information for either start using digital technologies or to use them in a better and more effective way. at second place, the statements about convenience reflect the desire to receive from the manufacturers services and/or products that can make their work easier, more affordable and more productive. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 15 macro trends / scenario laboratories this chapter analyses the point of view of the dental laboratories about digital technologies, the use, the acceptance and the impacts. the dental laboratories were invited to state what they think about their future role in the production of the digital restorations, and about their relationship with the main players involved in this digital change: the dental practices, the laboratories themselves and the industry. use of digital technologies in dental laboratories indirect restorations performed with digital technologies more than half of the sample (57%) stated to provide their clients with digital restorations. germany and spain are the countries showing the highest percentages. again, german laboratories are the ones providing more often than others prostheses made with digital technologies: 37% of laboratories (vs. 31% overall) provides this service on a regular basis. like in all investigated countries, the percentage of laboratories providing digital restorations is higher than the percentage of practices doing so. again the percentage in uk is considerably lower than the overall result. chart use of digital technologies in dental laboratories - europe vs. breakdown per country key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 16 use of digital technologies breakdown by technology and channel the portion of the sample providing digital restorations was requested to specify how they do that. chart use of digital technologies breakdown by technology the most common way to produce digital restorations is to produce scan files (55%) to be sent outside to an external organization (either a partner lab or a manufacturer/milling center). a good portion of the sample uses at least a milling unit installed at their laboratory (34%). chart use of digital technologies breakdown by technology europe vs. breakdown per country germany, france and the uk are the countries showing the highest percentage of respondents stating to use at least one scanner to send the scan files outside for milling procedure. the same is with regard to the milling unit used at the laboratory, while the lowest one is spain, which also shows the highest percentage of full outsourcing users. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 17 chart use of digital technologies breakdown by channel the manufacturer (or milling center) is the most common channel used to produce digital restorations. the manufacturer/milling center is requested to mill digital restorations by receiving either a traditional plaster model from the laboratory, or a scan file, from laboratories equipped with a scanner. chart use of digital technologies breakdown by channel europe vs. breakdown per country once again, germany and france show higher percentages in the use of the channel manufacturer/milling center while spain shows the highest percentage in the use of a partner lab, together with italy. given the lower number of cases, the results of the uk should be taken as an indication only. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 18 chart 19a and 19b. use of digital technologies breakdown by technology and channel europe in overall, it is also possible to analyze the information shown at slides 15 and 17 by crossing the data, whose results are shown in the following chart. the chart shows in the rows the information regarding the technologies (in-lab milling, scanner and full outsourcing). in the columns the information is related to both the channels and the technologies. the information can be read as follows: with regard to the technology users, out of the total scanner users (red circled data, respondents using a scanner to send the scan files outside for milling), in 11% of the cases they also have an in-lab milling at the laboratory, and in 10% of the cases they also send the models outside for milling (either to a manufacturer/milling center or a partner lab). on the other hand, with regard to the channel users, out of the total manufacturer users (blue circled data, respondents sending either the models or scan files to a manufacturer/milling center), in 91% of the cases they send the scan files to a manufacturer, in 11% of the cases they have an in-lab milling, and in 19% of the cases they also send their models outside for milling to a manufacturer. this is a kind of multiple answer question. also, the same information is available with the channels in rows, and in the columns there are again both the channels and the technologies. the information can be read as follows: with regard to the technology users, out of the total scanner users (red circled data, respondents sending their scan files outside for milling), in 85% of key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 19 the cases, they send the scan files to the manufacturer/milling center channel, in 44% of the cases they also send the scan files to a partner lab, and 11% of them also have an in-lab milling. on the other hand, with regard to the channel users, out of the total partner lab users (blue circled data, respondents sending their models or scan files to a partner lab), 48% of them also send their models or scan files to a manufacturer/milling center and 11% of them also have an in-lab milling. of course, this is a kind of multiple answer question as well.",

    "text": "role of digital technologies in the future chart influence of digital technologies on prosthetics performance europe vs. breakdown per country the approach of the laboratories is not very different from that of dental practices, as the majority of the respondents state to believe the digital prosthetics will have a relevant role but the traditional prosthetics will be relevant in the future, too. in specific regard to this statement, the percentage (70%) is higher than that of the dental practices (54%). in comparison to the overall result, clearly, the german market, given its weight, influences the overall results, but it is interesting to note how the most mature market regarding digital technologies, the german one, believe the new technologies will have a relevant role, but the traditional prosthetics will be relevant in the future anyway. in addition, relevant differences in the uk are related to the fact that a higher than average portion of respondents state that the digital technologies will affect only a part of the prosthetics, therefore its role will not be paramount. (15% vs 7% overall). key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 20 digital technology acceptance in dental laboratories stance versus digital technologies at this stage, the level of acceptance of the digital technologies was evaluated, with specific regard to how much the technicians feel comfortable with the new technologies. chart laboratories stance to digital technologies europe vs. breakdown per country there is a relevant difference between dentists and technicians, as the former mostly think that it is necessary to get closer to digital technologies because they are the future, while the latter clearly state to be comfortable in using it (42% overall). only 21% stated to feel uncomfortable. much lower than the result of the clinical sample (21% vs 38% of the clinical sample). germany stands out with its positive stance versus the digital technologies. the majority of the respondents in the other countries (france and uk on top) is getting closer to the digital technologies, typical of the development phase of a new market. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 21 relationship among dentists, technicians and the industry in the future of digital technologies chart change in the relationship among dentists, technicians and the industry europe vs. breakdown per country while the most quoted answer is, in overall, the same seen in the clinical sample (the relationship with the industry will become tighter) unlike it happened with the dentists sample, the second most quoted answer is that the relationship with the technicians will become blander, due to the fact that dentists are not required to get specific expertise about cad processing. this clearly is the technicians point of view, perhaps, this is affected by the worries that the chairside cad-cam may replace all or part of the activities once performed solely by the laboratories. in particular, italy and france show higher than average percentages for this option. while spain and germany give great importance to the strengthening of the relationship with the industry, the uk is higher than average in the statement related to the tightening of the relationship between dentists and technicians. required features from digital technology providers chart what technicians expect from a digital technology provider, in order to improve and enhance the way they perform restorations and prosthetics europe key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 22 basically, the conclusions about the required features from a digital technologies provider are on par with the dentists sample: convenience, training and information are the most mentioned ones. and the conclusions may well be the same: those elements could improve the users experience and attract new users, when the need for information and support is met. macro trends / scenario 3d printing this chapter analyses the awareness and the stance about the availability of 3d printing and in specific its availability in the dental sector. chart awareness of 3d digital printing - europe the awareness among dental practices clearly is different from the laboratories (82% vs 92%), nevertheless it can be considered very high in both cases. while in the clinical market there is no relevant difference among the countries, on the laboratory side the awareness is lower in italy, france and spain. the percentage of awareness is almost the same with regard to the availability of 3d printing in dentistry, but in this case, uk shows the lowest percentage of awareness both in the clinical and technical segments. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 23 chart most suitable indications for 3d printing - europe its interesting to note that the first mentioned indications quoted by the respondents are the same for both samples, but the third one in the clinical sample, surgical guides has been quoted as the first one in the technical sample. crowns & bridges look to be relevant in both samples. chart main consequences in dentistry brought by 3d printing - europe both samples agreed on the most relevant change brought by 3d printing in dentistry would be the increase in the kinds of materials available and of the digital procedures available. in comparison to the overall results there are no relevant differences among the evaluated countries. the reduction in the price of the restorations is not seen to be a major change. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 24 macro trends / scenario conclusions the penetration of the digital technologies is higher among the dental technicians than among the dental practices, especially in the use of digital equipment. with specific regard to the dentists, the most used way to provide digital restorations is to send impressions to a third party to produce the digital restorations. however, according to the opinion of all respondents, the digital technologies will have a relevant role in the future of prosthetics, despite some grade of discomfort, mostly due to the lack of information and training. by looking at the most relevant features required by a digital technology provider, the (economic) convenience appears to be one of the most important factors to work on, in order to speed up the propagation of the new technologies. the uk and germany represent two opposite situations, where uk shows a lower than average penetration in the use of digital technologies and germany shows a rather higher than average percentage. however, german respondents seem to be rather conservative, as both, dentists and technicians show higher penetration rates, but still are the respondents who feel more uncomfortable with the technology. it is interesting to evaluate the position of spain, italy and france as countries that they firmly believe the digital technologies are the future of prosthetics and foresee a future tightening of the relationship with the industry due to the increase in the demand for case specific manufactured products. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 25 brand awareness and positioning the analysis on digital technologies went deeper with the investigation of the main brands of this segment. in specific, the brand awareness focused on the most quoted brands. the unaided awareness has shown that, among dental practices, there are a few well-known brands whose performance is very high. on the other hand, when considering the technical market, the brands mentioned by the respondents are several, to testify that the digital technologies in the laboratory are a more mature market. chart unaided brand awareness- europe sirona and 3m are the brands to be mentioned among the most relevant ones in both samples, in particular, the former is among the top three brands in both samples. the laboratory market shows several brands whose longtime presence in the laboratory market is unquestionable, and the rather low number of brands mentioned by the clinical sample testifies the relatively young business. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 26 chart brand positioning, items average scores - europe when it comes to consider the brand positioning, it must be said that the relative scores quoted by both samples are rather consistent, showing almost the same behavior. both samples gave lower than average scores for the item too expensive, good price/quality ratio and affordable, while the performance of other items related to the brand reputation and reliability received higher scores. when considering the brands individually, in the clinical market, while sirona is rather on average, its interesting to note that kavo performed better than the competitors with regard to affordability and customer service oriented, while 3m is more than other brands associated with too expensive and worldwide renowned. on the technical side, it is worth to mention bego, which is higher than average in trustworthy, but far below for too expensive, and sirona, whose performance on affordability and customer service oriented, is not on par with the other brands. zirkonzahn showed higher scores for recommendation and innovation, while amann girrbach is higher than average in good price quality ratio. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 27 chart brand positioning, bivariate correlation analysis: weight of items on the recommendation - europe the bivariate correlation analysis takes into account the relative weight of the single items on a pre- determined dependent variable, which is the recommendation. its a useful analysis which goes beyond the plain and rational score given by the respondents, and tries to assess the actual importance of the different items on the recommendation. the charts show that, apart from the item trustworthy, whose importance is unquestionable, the main ones are rather different, according to the sample considered. among laboratories, given the relative longtime presence of this kind of technologies, the recommendation seems to be mostly affected by items related to the daily practice and innovation. on the clinical side, perhaps due to the fact that the market is less mature, some items strictly linked to the reputation prevail, as if the users, or the potential users, should be mostly concerned by the confidence in the brand first. affordability, for both samples, doesnt affect the recommendation at all. chart brand positioning, factor analysis - europe key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 28 the factor analysis allows for a further data processing, where the items related to the recommendation are grouped into factors, thanks to a specific data processing. both factor analyses worked at their best when the output consisted in two factors, whose meaning and names have been the same for both groups. the first factor was nearness and the second one was reputation. even though the driving items are not exactly the same, both analysis may have the same meaning: nearness is the factor driven by items clearly related to the close relationship that a company may show, like customer service, affordability, reliability, while the second factor named reputation is made up of items in close relation to the image and reputation of a brand. chart brand positioning, factor analysis map - europe despite the factor analysis showed the same factors for both groups, the positioning maps had rather different results. the map of the dental practices sample was clearly influenced by the high weight of sirona in the analysis, whose position was in the middle of the map. a bit more scattered the map of the sample made up of dental laboratories. in the analysis on the laboratories, sirona has no central position and its brand image looks not to be related neither to the nearness, nor to the reputation. kavo brand image looks to be almost the same in both analysis, that is, more linked to the nearness and on average with regard to the reputation. other relevant topics worth to be mentioned are the position of dentsply in the analysis on the dental practices, very much related to the nearness, and the position of ivoclar vivadent in the analysis on the laboratories, which seems to be highly related to the reputation, just like zirkonzahn and, to a lesser extent, 3shape. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 29 equipment use and intention to buy the analysis on digital technologies went deeper with the investigation of the main used brands of this segment. in specific, the investigation took into consideration the brands used for scanning and for milling. chart equipment use: scanners - europe the analysis proved that the penetration of this kind equipment varies widely, according to the sample taken into consideration. the sample of dental practices made up of digital technologies users stated to use an intraoral scanner in 20% of the cases, while the corresponding sample of laboratories stated to use a scanner in 84% of the cases. for the former sample, the penetration of dental scanners related to those laboratories having a scanner for either sending outside scan files (in this case, the percentage is 55%) or to be used with an in-lab milling center. chart equipment use: brand numeric distribution, scanners - europe key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 30 it is worth to note that only sirona, 3shape and dental wings showed up in both distributions. while sirona was stated as the first one in the sample of dental practices, among laboratories 3shape is the leading company, followed by zirkonzahn and amann girrbach. chart equipment use: milling units - europe the analysis on the penetration of milling units proved to be very similar to what seen for the scanners, although the penetration of milling units in the laboratory market showed a lower percentage than that of the scanners. the percentage of milling unit users among dental practices providing digital restorations was 14%, while among the dental laboratories providing digital restorations was 34%. chart equipment use: brand numeric distribution, milling units- europe key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 31 the number of dental practices using a milling unit was rather low, therefore the information should be considered as an indication only. nevertheless, this was enough to highlight sirona dominant position by a relevant margin. the analysis by country saw sirona as the most mentioned brand everywhere and planmeca as the main follower. with regard to the sample of the laboratories, the most quoted brand was amann girrbach, followed by zirkonzahn and sirona. the analysis by country showed rather diverse situations: amann girrbach was the first one only in germany, while sirona was the top brand in italy and the uk. france saw zirkonzahn to be the most relevant one and in spain the first one was roland. additionally, the analysis on the dental laboratories also covered the numeric distribution of the manufacturers/milling centers used to send scan files or models. the most quoted one resulted to be bego, followed by heraeus kulzer, dentsply-atlantis, nobel biocare and caddent. with regard to the numeric distribution by country, its worth to note the presence of some local organizations in italy, spain and france (new ancorvis and la struttura in italy, sineldent in spain and anthogyr in france). given the rather low number of cases, the results should be taken as an indication only.",

    "text": "chart reasons to use: scanners - europe the most quoted reasons to use mentioned by the sample of dental practices are quite different from those quoted by the dental laboratories. among the dental practices prevails the ease of use and the comfort, either it be for the patients or for the dentists themselves. only later on come the innovation and the precision of the system. on the other hand, among the sample of dental laboratories, the quality of the restorations and the range of procedures available prevail, that is, first come quality and key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 32 flexibility. also, the responses from the laboratories make understand that the increase in the productivity is felt to be an important feature that the digital technologies have to bring. chart reasons to use: milling units - europe efficiency, simplification of the procedures and overall increased quality over the traditional prosthetics procedures are among the most relevant reasons mentioned for use of a chairside milling, or a milling unit at the lab. in this case, the results of the dentists sample are not very different from those of laboratories. chart intention to buy: scanners/milling units - europe its interesting to note that the more mature technical market also shows a lower percentage of intention to by a scanner/milling unit than the dental practices. and again, when it comes to the evaluation of this indicator by country, germany shows the lowest percentages of intention to buy. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 33 with regard to the clinical sample, the countries showing the highest percentages of intention to buy are italy and spain, while among the laboratories, the countries are italy and france. among the most relevant reasons for not buying a scanner/milling unit, there are the lack of need, therefore it is not felt necessary, so it may be a good point for future commercial actions by the companies involved in this segment, and the excessive cost, together with the fact that a good portion of respondents still feel the traditional method to be the most preferred one. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 34 customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics the analysis of the overall scores of the customer satisfaction highlighted the relatively lower scores given by the sample of dental practices in comparison to the results showed by the dental laboratories. although the quality seems to be unquestionable, the same item accuracy and quality of the restorations showed an average of 7,8 in the sample of dental practices, while among laboratories it showed a score of 8,3 and for both it was the highest score among all investigated items. the other items to be the most satisfactory for both samples, were handiness/ease of use and wide range of materials available, which somehow match the needs expressed by both samples in the analysis of the most important reasons to use. reliability completes the list of the most relevant items that received the highest satisfaction scores, while, on the bottom side there is the price area, with the items overall running costs and cost of sw updates, which received among the lowest scores. the correlation analysis will explain which items are more relevant in the assessment of the overall satisfaction and if there are critical items to be monitored closely. chart customer satisfaction: bivariate correlation analysis: weight of items on the overall satisfaction europe its interesting to note that no item related to the assistance and support has been mentioned among the most satisfactory items. given the high technology content of this specific product segment, the support from the company becomes crucial and the multiple correlation analysis highlighted the importance of some items - related to the support and assistance from the manufacturer whose satisfaction score was not ranked among the highest ones. overall running cost, which resulted to be a key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 35 rather unsatisfactory item, looks to be more important to the dental practices, in the assessment of the overall satisfaction, than to the laboratories. chart customer satisfaction: bivariate correlation analysis map - europe in the lower right side of the maps there are the items whose satisfaction was not high, but whose weight on the overall satisfaction has to be considered higher than average, thus representing, from an overall point of view, key factor of success. in the sample of dental practices, the analysis highlighted the support and the assistance from the manufacturer, along with the running costs, to be critical in the assessment of the overall satisfaction. the sample of dental laboratories highlighted, other than the assistance in case of repair, a clear need for sw updates and flexibility from the manufacturer to meet the needs of their customers (laboratories). if the analysis is performed on the single manufacturers, the key factors of success become weak items, because their importance is high, but their satisfaction score is lower than average and all most relevant items mentioned for the overall analysis are present as weak items in the analysis by brand. on the laboratory side, its worth to highlight the weaknesses related to the service and support area for sirona, the running costs (overall and sw updates) and flexibility for amann girrbach and, in general, a lack of satisfaction in the area of assistance and support. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 36 chart customer satisfaction, factor analysis - europe the factor analysis (4 factors) performed on the customer satisfaction items highlighted, as happened with the recommendation, almost the same items. management costs and compatibility were exactly the same, while the first two were slightly different. in the clinical sample the quality of the product is joint to the quality of the service, thus making just one factor product and service quality, while in the sample of dental laboratories the product quality is alone and the service is part of a different factor focused on the area of support and assistance. the technical assistance and support make the difference: for the dental practices, they belong to the first factor, while for the laboratory they belong to the second one. chart customer satisfaction, multiple regression analysis - europe this analysis takes care of assessing how much the single factors affect the overall satisfaction. as previously seen in the factor analysis, the technical assistance and support look to be important, because in the sample of dental practices the first factor, which includes those items, weights far more than the other ones (43%), while in the sample of dental laboratories is the second factor again, including those factors the most important one, with 33% of weight on the overall satisfaction. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 37 also, its worth to underline the relative higher importance of the cost items for the dental practices, given that the factor management costs weights 26% vs 18% for the dental laboratories. conclusions the brand awareness highlighted a not negligible influence by the digital technologies in general, especially with regard to the dental practices, where some brands may have seen their performance affected by market segments like digital x-ray and digital guided surgery for dental implants. sirona resulted to be by far the brand with the most relevant performance, especially among dental practices. as for the dental laboratories, the performance of sirona faces the presence of other brands like 3shape, dental wings, zirkonzahn and amann girrbach. the factor analysis highlighted a possible positioning of the mentioned brands according to two main factors, the nearness and the reputation possibly affecting the recommendation. while on the sample of dental practices the positioning resulted to be rather affected by the performance of sirona, whose position was not distinctive, the analysis performed on the dental laboratories highlighted kavo positioning to be more related to the nearness, and so was for bego, while other brands like ivoclar vivadent, 3shape and zirkonzahn have been more linked to the reputation. the use of the different equipment is more widespread among the dental laboratories, whose penetration resulted to be far higher than the dental practices. the fact that the technical market may be considered rather more mature than the clinical one, is proved by the intention to buy digital equipment in the future, whose value was just 12% versus 21% of the dental practices. the brand numeric distribution highlighted a higher number of competitors present in the technical segment than the clinical one, and the distribution highlighted the same brands mentioned in the awareness analysis. the most important reasons to use mentioned by the respondents were related to ease of use, comfort, quality and efficiency, other than the possibility offered by this kind of technology to shorten the production workflow and increase the productivity, but the multivariate analysis performed on the satisfaction highlighted some critical items related to the service and support from the manufacturers, which didnt receive fully satisfactory scores, but whose importance in the assessment of the overall satisfaction was above average. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 38 appendix: production dental laboratories chart indirect digital restorations production (calculation from number of restorations) - europe the overall production of digital indirect restorations showed a higher than average performance from germany, followed by the uk, which, although is the country with the lowest percentage of digital technologies users among the investigated countries, highlighted a rather high production among the users of this technology (given the low number of cases, this information should be taken as an indication only). the lowest production comes from italy. chart indirect digital restorations production breakdown by material (calculation from number of restorations) - europe key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 39 the statements from the respondents proved the zirconia to be the most used one, followed by cocr. germany shows a higher than average use of zirconia, while some others, such as france and spain, look to make more use of cocr. lithium disilicate seems to be more than average used in italy and uk. given the low number of cases, the information regarding the countries should be considered as a qualitative information.",

10 base: 722 cases more than half of the sample provide digital restorations. the highest percentage is in spain, while, as it happens among dental practices, the lowest penetration of the digital technologies is in uk. scenario: use of digital technologies in dental laboratories do you provide your customers with indirect restorations performed with digital technologies? 11 base: 722 cases its interesting to note that although uk is the country showing the lowest penetration of the digital restorations, among the users, it shows among the highest percentages of regular use of it. scenario: role of digital technologies on prosthetics in the future how do you feel the new digital technologies (cad-cam and 3d printing) will affect the way the prosthetics is carried out in your country? 12 base: 722 cases the approach of the laboratories is not very different from that of dental practices, as the majority of the respondents state to believe the digital prosthetics will have a relevant role but the traditional prosthetics will be relevant in the future, too. in specific regard to this statement, the percentage (70%) is higher than dental practices (54%). interesting the position of uk, different from the other countries, where a more relevant part of respondents believe that digital technologies will not have a relevant role. clearly the german market, given its weight, influences the overall results, but its interesting to note how the most mature market regarding digital technologies, the german one, believes the new technologies will have a relevant role, nevertheless, the traditional prosthetics will be relevant in the future anyway. scenario: role of digital technologies on prosthetics in the future how do you feel the new digital technologies (cad-cam and 3d printing) will affect the way the prosthetics is carried out in your country? 13 base: 722 cases there is no difference between digital technologies users and traditional prosthetics providers, while its interesting to note the high percentage, among full outsourcing users, and among partner lab users, regarding the statement that digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics. scenario: stance versus digital technologies what is your stance versus the digital technologies? 14 base: 722 cases there is a relevant difference between dentists and technicians, as the former mostly think that its necessary to get closer to digital technologies because they are the future, while the latter clearly state to be comfortable in using it. much lower the percentage of those feeling uncomfortable with digital technologies. germany stands out with its positive stance versus the digital technologies. the majority of french respondents is getting closer to the digital technologies, typical of the development phase of a new market. it looks like an area of resistance is present, made up of those using the digital technologies because they need, but feeling uncomfortable about that. it is the minority, but it must be added to the more relevant share of those clearly feeling uncomfortable with digital technologies. scenario: stance versus digital technologies what is your stance versus the digital technologies? 15 base: 722 cases among laboratories is more evident the difference in the stance versus digital technologies, between those using it already and the rest of the sample, not providing digital technologies at all. the difference is more evident when considering the comparison between full outsourcing users and other digital restorations providers. scenario: role of dentists and technicians in the future how do you think dentists and technicians role will change with the new digital technologies? 16 base: 722 cases in overall, the majority of respondents think that - as it happens among dentists - that the cooperation will get tighter, due to the expertise of the technicians. slightly higher than the sample of dental practices is the percentage of respondents stating there will not be any change at all: the higher one is from spain, italy and france. again, the stance of german respondents is quite different from the other countries, where a higher share of respondents believe that the dentists will need to get more expert about prosthetics. scenario: role of dentists and technicians in the future how do you think dentists and technicians role will change with the new digital technologies? 17 base: 722 cases interestingly, the highest percentage of statements about the fact that the dentists will replace part of the technicians activity, come from those not involved in digital prosthetics and, among those providing digital restorations, from those doing this in full outsourcing. scenario: change in the relationship among dentists, technicians, industry how do you think the relationship between dentists and technicians and the industry will change with the new digital technologies? 18 base: 722 cases just like it happened with the dentists sample, the majority of respondents think that most of all the relationship with the industry will become tighter, due to the increased demand for case specific products and services. this is mostly true for germany and spain. uk is different from the other countries, as the most quoted answer is the relationship between dentists and technicians will become tighter. scenario: change in the relationship among dentists, technicians, industry how do you think the relationship between dentists and technicians and the industry will change with the new digital technologies? 19 base: 722 cases there is no relevant difference in the answers of the different profiles, safe for full outsourcing providers, whose feeling about an increased cooperation between dentists and technicians is higher. scenario: required features from digital technology providers what should your digital technology provider offer you, to improve and enhance the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your laboratory? 20 base: 722 cases a provider will clearly need to give support to the users of the digital technology, in terms of training and information, and convenience. about 7% of respondents look for improved performances and another small portion of respondents quoted customer service which is again related to the support that should be provided by the manufacturers. scenario: required features from digital technology providers what should your digital technology provider offer you, to improve and enhance the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your laboratory? 21 training and information is the most quoted answer in uk and spain, while convenience is the first one in all other countries. total de fr it convenience 43% convenience 49% convenience 33% convenience 34% training and information 28% training and information 27% not interested 26% not interested 26% not interested 24% not interested 26% improve performances 19% training and information 25% improve performances 7% innovation 2% training and information 14% improve performances 11% innovation 3% improve performances 1% innovation 6% innovation 3% customer service 2% customer service 1% customer service 5% customer service 3% other 2% other 2% other 5% other 1% don't know 13% don't know 0% don't know 29% don't know 35% total 722 total 366 total 98 total 139 total sp uk convenience 43% training and information 38% training and information 48% training and information 28% convenience 35% convenience 39% not interested 24% not interested 16% improve performances 25% improve performances 7% improve performances 5% not interested 1% innovation 3% innovation 1% innovation 9% customer service 2% customer service 1% customer service 0% other 2% other 5% other 0% don't know 13% don't know 14% don't know 10% total 722 total 77 total 42 scenario: 3d printing awareness are you aware of the 3d printing technology?

brand image vs recommendation - correlation analysis ranking 40 focus on weight on recommendation when the analysis is performed on the ranking based on the weight that the different items have on the recommendation of the main brands, its interesting to note how not all items are relevant to all brands. the light grey coloured items are not relevant to the recommendation and its interesting to see that some brands show some items to be not relevant. this is the case of zirkonzahn, dental wings and ivoclar vivadent. the first four items, generally speaking, are the most important ones, with some brands showing exceptions, like 3m, where among the most important items affecting the recommendation are leading company and good price quality ratio; kavo where items like customer service oriented and good price quality ratio are important. amann girrbach also show some differences: the most relevant items are reliable and customer service oriented. overall ranking 3shape sirona 3m zirkon zahn kavo bego amann girrbach dental wings ivoclar vivadent other makes daily practice easier 1 1 1 5 3 10 5 6 6 8 2 trustworthy 2 4 2 9 2 1 1 3 9 7 4 innovative and at the forefront 3 2 4 8 4 7 9 9 2 5 3 highly reputable 4 3 3 2 1 2 2 4 1 3 7 customer service oriented 5 7 8 6 7 3 6 2 3 2 1 reliable 6 5 5 7 8 9 3 1 5 4 5 good price quality ratio 7 8 6 1 10 4 10 8 10 1 6 leading company 8 9 10 3 5 5 7 5 8 9 9 worldwide renowned 9 6 9 4 9 6 8 7 4 11 10 affordable 10 10 7 10 6 8 4 10 7 6 8 too expensive 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 10 11 brand image vs recommendation - correlation analysis map 41 the map is the visual results of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. on the horizontal axis there is the weight on the recommendation of each item, and on the vertical one theres the rating of each item.",

(low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) the items on the upper right side of the map, very close one to each other, will be further investigated on the factor analysis, which allow an in-depth analysis on a reduced number of variables and a more qualitative interpretation. brand positioning: factor analysis 42 the reduction into factors allowed us to obtain 2 main drivers, nearness vs. reputation. they are very relevant in order to achieve a positioning analysis. this kind of analysis, has a relevant advantage: the here defined set of 2 drivers allows to design a positioning map, explained by the following slide. factor 1 (nearness) it is driven by items like good price quality ratio, affordability, customer service oriented, clearly related to the nearness, whose concept is reinforced by trustworthy, makes daily practice easier and reliable. factor 2 (reputation) it is driven by items clearly related to the reputation, such as worldwide renowned and highly reputable on top of all. too expensive may be part of the reputation as brand with high reputation are often seen as more expensive than the average, but, although the item belongs to this area, its not as strong as shown in the analysis on dental practices. factor analysis its goal is to reduce the information contained in several variables by synthesizing a few factors. it aims to identify a substructure underlying a group of variables, and resume this substructure with a reduced number of latent variables. thanks to the factor analysis, some positioning drivers can be identified, that, as a matter of fact, represent the brand image analysed. two factors nearness reputation good price quality ratio 0,754 affordable 0,738 customer service oriented 0,647 trustworthy 0,598 makes daily practice easier 0,595 reliable 0,581 worldwide renowned 0,793 highly reputable 0,707 leading company 0,698 innovative and at the forefront 0,653 too expensive 0,047 the regression analysis performed on the mentioned factors highlighted an almost equal weight of both factors, with some slight differences as the different brands are considered. brand positioning: positioning map 1 the map is an actual brand positioning one, as it shows how the different brands are seen, with regard to the factors identified, by the respondents. 43 according to the results shown on the map, there are some brands whose image is more related than other to the reputation. this is the case of 3shape, zirkonzahn and ivoclar vivadent, whose position is on the upper side of the map, where the reputation factor is more relevant. the image of bego and kavo is more linked than others to the nearness. it is worth to highlight the position of zirkonzahn as its image seems to be linked to both factors, the reputation and the nearness, while sirona image looks to be not linked to the nearness. less relevant nearness more relevant less relevant reputation more relevant brand positioning: positioning map 2 - demographic analysis this map analyses where some different profiles are positioned, if closer to the nearness concept having an influence on the recommendation, or if the driving factor is the reputation. 44 the fact that some different profiles are closer than other (e.g. germany and 50 restorations or more) doesnt mean that those profiles are related to each other (i.e. its not said that german respondents produce 50 restorations or more). milling unit owners recommendation looks to be more linked to both factors, while full outsourcing users are more driven by the reputation. germanys recommendation is more influenced by the nearness, while, as it happens for the clinical samples, french respondents have their recommendation more linked to the reputation. in general, as the age increases, the sensitivity to both factors increases as well. digital technology owners recommendation seem to be more liked to both factors. less relevant nearness more relevant less relevant reputation more relevant brand positioning: positioning map 3 - psychographic analysis 45 in this map, some psychographic profiles are present. by analyzing the nearness factor, its clear how as the positive attitude and feeling towards the digital technologies increase, also increases the relationship of the recommendation with this item. generally speaking, the recommendation seems to be more linked to the nearness concept, while the reputation, except for the respondents stating that the relationship will become tighter, seems to have a lower grade of relevance. the position of digital important but not relevant is affected by germany, which showed the majority of responses belonging to this item, and whose position in the previous slide is very similar. its interesting to note that the difference in the feeling feel uncomfortable and feel closer is resolved by the nearness, which helps a lot in increasing the comfort towards the new technology. less relevant nearness more relevant less relevant reputation more relevant this map analyses where some different profiles are positioned, if the nearness concept has an impact on the recommendation, or if the driving factor is the reputation. digital technology penetration scenario: digital technology use - breakdown by technology how do you provide digital restorations in your laboratory? 47 base: 411 cases focus on digital restoration providers among digital technology users, the most used technology is scanner, followed by the in lab milling unit. the most used way to provide digital restorations is to send scans to a manufacturer or milling center. processing without don't know 55% is the percent of scanner owners, out of the total digital restorations providers, who use the scanner to send the files outside for milling. the total % of scanner owners, including those used with the in-lab milling units is 84%, as shown in the following slides. scenario: digital technology use -

improvement area, where we can find the weak points of a certain company. satisfaction related to the whole market here we can highlight some prerequisites (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors satisfy the market), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, where companies are not always able to satisfy customers with regard to strategic issues), and indifference areas (lower-left side of the map) which become waste/not efficient areas when a company decides to invest in those items belonging to the upper-left side of the map since, they tends to satisfy the market but they actually dont affect the overall satisfaction at all. bivariate correlation analysis the bivariate correlation analysis is a technique that helps to identify and measure the influence of the independent variables (in this case, each brand positioning item) on the dependent one (in this case, the recommendation). the bivariate correlation analysis has been used to quantify the relation between the score on the single factors and the rating on the recommendation customer satisfaction - correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the overall satisfaction? 76 items satisfaction score items weight on overall satisfaction in the correlation data processing all items proved to be relevant, thus all items are included in the analysis. the reliability and the support and assistance from the company have the highest weight on the overall satisfaction, while the cost of sw updates and the compatibility with other brands seem to have the lowest weight. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis overall 77 (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) (low) satisfaction score (high) not all the most relevant items in the assessment of the overall satisfaction belong to a specific area of service or technical features of the products, but there is a mix of them. its interesting to note, however, that the items more linked to the service area have received lower satisfaction rates, such as technical assistance, company availability and start-up training. in overall, the costs dont seem to be relevant in the assessment of the overall satisfaction. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis 3shape 78 (low) satisfaction score (high) (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) as seen in the overall map, the cost areas is not part of the most relevant items affecting the overall satisfaction. moreover, all important items seem to be quite satisfactory to 3shape users. it must be said, however, that some items look to be in a weaker position, such as start- up training, frequency of sw updates and technical assistance in case of repair. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis amann girrbach 79 (low) satisfaction score (high) (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) amann girrbach overall satisfaction seems to be affected by several items, being important to its users, but not all of them show a high score. the weakest items are related to the cost area, to the availability and flexibility of the company and the compatibility with other brands. technical assistance and technical support, despite showing very good rates, looks to be less important than other items. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis sirona 80 (low) satisfaction score (high) (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) the cost of the sw updates looks to be very close to be an issue with sirona customers, as it received very low scores, and it is very close to the region where the importance in the assessment of the overall satisfaction is higher than average. other weak items are technical assistance, company availability and flexibility and business development support. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis dentsply 81 (low) satisfaction score (high) (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) in the map for dentsply, the weakest items in the overall satisfaction look to belong to the area of support from the company, such as start-up training, business development support, technical support, but also the frequency of sw updates is felt to be important, while its rating was not so satisfactory. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis zirkonzahn 82 (low) satisfaction score (high) (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) the map for zirkonzahn is quite coherent and almost all important items have received satisfactory ratings. among the weakest ones, can be mentioned start-up training, technical support and technical assistance in case of repair. all of them belongs to the service area. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis dental wings 83 (low) satisfaction score (high) (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) dental wings map shows several interesting situations. the items being close to critical area are several and none is related to a technical feature of the equipment: all of them are related to services provided by the company. the wide range of materials available received satisfactory ratings but they dont seem to affect the overall satisfaction relevantly. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis 3m 84 (low) satisfaction score (high) (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) like already seen for 3shape, the map for 3m doesnt show a specific issue in the lower-right side of the map. close to this area there are the technical assistance in case of repair and the technical support from the company. some of the items have been removed due to the fact that they are not relevant in 3m correlation analysis. customer satisfaction: factor analysis 85 the reduction into factors allowed us to obtain 4 main drivers, product quality, support and assistance, management costs, compatibility. factor 1 (product quality) it is related to the intrinsic qualities of the product. differently from what seen in the analysis carried out on dental practices, the first factor clearly is related to the performance of the product. not only in terms of accuracy and reliability, but also handiness and wide range of materials available. start-up training is considered to be a topic necessary to the use of the product, not properly related to the service a company can provide, but most of all its necessary to the same use of the product. factor 2 (support and assistance) the second factor shows all soft components related to the grade of availability and support the company can provide to their customers in the use of the digital technologies. the strongest items of this factor are the technical support and the business development support. its interesting to note that what was not relevant to the assessment of the overall satisfaction in the analysis on dental practices, for the laboratories, the business development support becomes relevant and it is among the driving items of the second factor. factor 3 (management costs) the new digital technologies have to be considered a business of the dental laboratories, like it was for dental practices, so that the management costs are also important to make this business profitable for the dental labs. in this sense, the running costs and the cost for sw updates make a separate factor accounting for the overall satisfaction. this factor has not to be confused with the cost for acquiring a digital equipment, but clearly, the ordinary costs, sustained every year to run the digital business, do have their own importance. factor 4 (compatibility) the fourth and last factor is strictly related to the compatibility with other systems, which allows for a easy way to expand the business and meet the needs from the clients (dentists and other laboratories). an open systems surely helps the users to be more flexible and ready to face the different situations that digital restorations shows. 4 factors product quality support and assistance management costs compatibility accuracy and quality of the restorations 0,807 reliability 0,733 handiness / ease of use 0,730 wide range of materials available 0,607 start-up training 0,552 technical support from the company 0,734 business development support 0,709 company availability and flexibility 0,679 technical assistance in case of repair 0,668 frequency of sw updates 0,601 cost of sw updates 0,811 overall running costs 0,752 compatibility with other brands 0,806 customer satisfaction: factor analysis - difference from the mean level of satisfaction by brand on the factors resulting from the factor analysis. 86 the displayed values represent the satisfaction level of those factors, with a value ranging from -1 to +1 where 0 represents the overall mean value. as shown in the chart on the right some brands seem to perform better in the satisfaction of some items in comparison to other ones, as happens for amann girrbach and zirkonzahn. other brands seem to perform below average in some of the considered factors. - + satisfaction level customer satisfaction: multiple regression analysis 87 what seen in the factor analysis takes here an assessment with regard to the importance that the multiple regression analysis highlights the single factors may have in determining the overall satisfaction. like it happened with the regression analysis on dental practices, the value of r2 is really high (0,777), so that a large portion of satisfaction can be explained by the items contained in the factors here shown. unlike what seen in the report for dental practices, there is no clear prevalence of one factor over the other ones. in this case, the items showing the highest weights on the satisfaction are two: product quality and support and assistance. it will be interesting to see if the same weight on the overall satisfaction is shown in the analysis performed on the single brands. the other factors are the same of the analysis performed on dental practices. management costs and compatibility again shows almost the same weight (18% the former, 17% the latter). (r2=0,777) overall satisfaction 32% 18% product quality management costs 33% support and assistance compatibility 17% customer satisfaction: multiple regression analysis 88 while 3shape breakdown of the weights of the different factors looks to be on par with the overall situation (only a lower weight for the compatibility), other companies show a different breakdown. this is the case of amann girrbach, where the product quality and the management costs show a higher than average weights. zirkonzahn and 3m show a very high weight of product quality, while then overall satisfaction of sirona, dentsply and dental wings look to be mostly affected by the factor support and assistance. multiple regression analysis the regression analysis is a multi-variate statistical technique whose main aim is to find out the existing relationship between a target variable (dependent variable, in our case, the overall satisfaction) and a group of independent variables (each single factor derived from the factor analysis). one of the main focus of the multiple regression is to assess how much part of the dependent variable (satisfaction) is explained by the independent variables (corner stone factors of the satisfaction which have been previously indicated: product quality, support and assistance, management costs, compatibility), i.e. how much these factors are influencing the behavior of the dependent one. conclusions 89 the german respondents had their relevant weight in this analysis, as the weight of this country is quite high. germany looks to be the most mature market with regard to the digital technologies, and to a certain extent the approach and the stance versus the digital world is different from that of the other countries. the overall scenario analysis highlighted a common belief regarding the fact that digital technologies are going to change the way the restorations and the dentistry in general will be performed. the change looks to be not so dramatic, meaning that the traditional prosthetic will maintain a certain distinct role even in the future. the roles and the cooperation between dentists and technicians looks not to be in danger, on the contrary it may tighten. moreover, a closer cooperation with the industry is expected as well. we are working on a further deepening of the topics investigated on an extensive, integrated report, which will include findings from both surveys (clinical and technical) and will contain our conclusions about the overall results. italy: torino - roma +39 011 3119430 +39 011 3118669 www.key-stone.it key-stone@key-stone.it powered by",

labs receiving intra-oral scan files if never, why? smaller labs bigger labs when the impact of ios scans on the lab business is positive, labs approach doctors more frequently. labs approaching dentists for the practice digitization is quite high, lower than average in the mediterranean countries. in spain, the development of digital technologies in the dental sector has accelerated significantly in the last two years, which is the reason why the percentage of laboratories approaching studies on this subject is high. the reason for not recommending varies with the size of the laboratories: small laboratories do not recommend because they do not feel adequate, while large laboratories, which are the most digitalised ones, are also the ones that can spend less time on this activity. bigger labs higher than average for a frequent approach (46% often). the frequency of the approaches to dentists is higher as the lab overall business trend is positive (43% often). labo base: 524 cases cases 123 108 101 91 101 full digital workflow 21 main arguments to convince doctors about digitization when discussing with your doctors about starting/furthering the digitization process of their practice with an intra-oral scanner, what argumentation do you use to convince them? - top 3 ranking the owner of the lab pays more attention to the workflow simplification (54%) and the improved perception of the practice (42%). lab managers talk more about the reduced number of remakes (41%). accuracy of the scan files is more often used by big sized labs (59%). improvement of the workflow is also more often quoted by respondents whose lab experienced an overall increase of their business (51%). technical, procedural and patients experience arguments are used the most. labo in italy, the proposed topics are significantly different from those of the rest of the countries. simplification of the workflow, improvement of the patient experience and of the perception of the practice among patients emerge as relevant, while the impact of the accuracy of the scans is low. some topics are very often listed in the top three as most relevant, resulting in better ranking averages. the items at the top right of the map, together with the item simplification of workflow suggest that there is a desire to improve the synergy between the practice and the laboratory and the management of the communication flow between them. base: 409 cases seldom and often quotes 22 frequency of doctors approaching labs about ios recommendation how often do you get approached by doctors about your recommendation on intra-oral scanner? 30% of dental labs are approached at least monthly. frequency of recommendation increases as the labs size and their digitization level increase. this is also true for labs performing a higher-than-average number of ortho cases with aligners. currently, spain is the country with the lowest penetration of ios but with higher growth rates and in full digitalization process. labo the laboratories state that they are approached by dentists with a certain frequency. a frequent approach is considered to be 'monthly' to 'daily'. although the frequency of approach is fairly homogeneous between countries, spain and france show a higher-than- average overall frequency of 'monthly/weekly/daily'. base: 594 cases cases 137 114 125 113 105 23 recommended intraoral scanner brands when asked by the clinician, do you recommend a specific intra-oral scanner brand? which intra-oral scanner brand do you recommend most often? 3shape is quoted more than average among big sized labs (49%), by the lab owners (39%), less recently open structures and those stating the business has decreased (40% and 46% respectively). itero is quoted more than average among more recently open labs (25%) and among labs receiving a high share of scan files (22%). less than average among labs performing a high share of prosthetic complex cases (12%). medit is quoted more than average among labs receiving a lower share of scan files (23%). dentsply sirona is quoted more than average among labs receiving scan files from more than half of clients (20%). labo recommendation is very high: on an overall basis, at least 90% of the laboratories approached by dentists recommend a brand. 3shape is the most recommended brand in spain and italy, while itero is most recommended in the uk. carestream has adopted a very widespread distribution and commercial strategy, which explains the high number of recommendations in italy (achieving a significantly higher penetration than in the other analysed countries). diverse recommended brands across the surveyed countries: 3shape is most quoted, itero is main follower. why do you recommend the mentioned ios brand? (multiple choice) scanner performance and clinic / lab integration are the most quoted reasons. brand reputation is quoted more often among bigger sized labs (62%) and those performing ortho cases with invisible aligners (58%). the latter also quote community more often than average (20%). integration is quoted more often by labs serving a higher number of practices (60%). service / post sales support is more often quoted by labs receiving a higher share of scan files (46%). base: 440 cases intraoral scanners brands when receiving scan files what are the top 3 brands of the intra-oral scanners that you receive files from? 24 3shape is top quoted brand for ios scan files received. carestream is very widespread in italy compared to the average in the other countries. 3shape is quoted more than average by bigger sized labs (73%) and so is for dentsply sirona (52%). again, 3shape is quoted more than average by labs equipped with a milling unit (62%) and 3d printer (60%). itero (52%) and medit (35%) are more often quoted among recently open labs. exocad users do show higher than average quotes for itero (46%). dentsply sirona is more than average quoted by labs receiving scan files from more than 50% of their clients (62%). full digital workflow labo base: 524 cases intraoral scanners brands: recommendation vs scan files reception when asked by the clinician, which intra-oral scanner brand do you recommend most often? what are the top 3 brands of the intra-oral scanners that you receive files from? 25 full digital workflow labo at overall level, a possible relationship between the brand of the ios from which the scan is received and the recommendation of the ios brand has been investigated. the results show that 3shape has the highest relationship between the brand from which the labs receive the scanner and the recommendation. it is also true that 3shape, due to its popularity and seniority in the ios market, has a high frequency of recommendation even in labs receiving scans from other brands. in fact, it is always cited as the second brand regardless of the brand of ios from which the labs receive scans (for carestream it is the first). this also shows that 3shape's reputation is very high. base: 524 cases 3shape dentsply sirona itero medit carestream planmeca 3shape 55% 26% 29% 24% 33% 17% dentsply sirona 12% 30% 9% 5% 7% 13% itero 13% 12% 37% 20% 16% 21% medit 8% 12% 8% 38% 8% 2% carestream 7% 9% 5% 8% 32% 8% planmeca 2% 7% 7% 2% 1% 35% ios brand: received files ios brand: recommendation other digital workflow components penetration chairside milling system penetration do you have a chairside milling system in your dental practice? 27 the penetration of the milling center in dental practices is rather low, but it is worth to underline that in germany this penetration of milling units is historically higher due to the presence of the so called practice lab. for both uk and germany, the higher presence of dentsply sirona make the penetration of this equipment higher than average. most of the installed equipment is rather old, with a slowdown in purchases in 2018 and 2019 and a subsequent growth in recent years (2020-2021).",

38 labs digitization is considered to be very important. a lower importance is recorded for smaller labs, while the opposite is true for bigger sized labs. in addition, when training and education is considered very important, importance of digitization of the lab is high too (62%). moreover, among itero platform users and when lab business has increased, the opinion that importance of digitization of the lab is very high increases (59% and 63% respectively). even the interest in increasing the share of scans from dentists is high*: in overall 82% of interviewees are interested. the interest is lower for smaller labs (72% for yes). labo what impact do you feel the acceptance of the ios scans has had on your dental laboratory business? positive impact is widely quoted overall. again, smaller sized labs quote a lower-than-average positive impact (55%). respondents attributing a high importance to training and education do quote a more than average positive impact (73%). the same is for bigger sized labs (73%). in addition, labs performing ortho cases with aligners do feel more than average an overall positive impact (72%) and those performing a higher number of simple fixed prosthesis cases too (73%). *would you be interested in increasing the % of intra-oral scans received vs. analog impressions in your lab?

top 3 ranking 39 reduced delivery time higher than average for spain (46%). ease of use higher than average in the uk (27%). accuracy is higher than average in bigger labs (60%), and among labs producing orthodontic aligners (57%). labo the main perceived benefits are related to the improvement of the workflow. in fact, the main items relate to simplification of the workflow, increased accuracy of scanned files and therefore increased productivity in the laboratory. in italy there is a greater perception of increased productivity, while in the uk and france the perception is greater for the accuracy of scans. base: 594 cases doctor digitization impact on laboratory staff do you feel that doctor digitization with intra oral scanners has had an impact on your laboratory staff? 40 digitization with the intraoral scanner has a positive impact on the laboratory staff according to 60% of the sample. the phenomenon is most relevant in uk (70%). the impact is more present on big labs (72%) and, generally speaking, among all labs experiencing a higher-than-average involvement in the digital workflow. the opposite is true for smaller sized labs (51% for yes) and in general for those labs not highly involved in the digital workflow. more recently open labs do see a more frequent impact (76%), while the opposite is true for less recently open ones (52%). labs producing a higher number of cases of fixed prosthetics (70%) or ortho cases with aligners (71%) do quote yes more than average. labo the impact on the laboratory staff is linked to the increased productivity and staff involvement. in italy, there is a greater perception of an increased need for staff training. higher than average quotes for increased training needs (89%) for those respondents attributing a high importance to education. labs receiving scan files from more than 50% of clients do quote a lower than average increased training needs (76%), and a higher than average increase in productivity (89%). recently open labs do quote more often increased staff engagement (90%). labs producing a high share of traditional works more often quoted increased training needs (95%). what impact do you feel doctor digitization with intraoral scanners has had for your laboratory staff? top 3 ranking base: 594 cases lab needs in terms of business support actions to help the business grow 42 what do you think is going to help you grow your business in the future? - top 3 ranking competitive pricing is more often quoted by bigger sized labs (38%) and by labs producing ortho cases with aligners (38%). labs recommending medit and carestream ios state more frequently quality of work (79% and 77%). labs producing a high share of traditional techniques quoted more than average simplification of the workflow (58%) and so is for labs serving a low number of dental practices (54%). quality of work and simplification of the workflow are the most sought-after actions. labo in terms of increasing business, the possibility of increasing the level of quality of work (the possibility of doing more complex work) and the simplification of workflow seem to be priorities. in italy, workflow simplification and the possibility of providing technical support to dentists is of greatest interest. in the uk, the possibility of being able to strengthen the relationship with the dentist is one of the most important aspects, in addition to the possibility of shortening the production time of the finished work. base: 594 cases expected additional support and services 43 what additional support & services would you expect from digital providers side? (multiple choice) training / education and support are most quoted needs for additional services. dedicated lab support is more often quoted by bigger sized labs (64%) and in general by labs receiving higher than average scan files from clients and those equipped with milling unit (59%). lab-to-doctor education support is more often quoted by labs attributing a high importance to training and education (44%), by those receiving high shares of models/impression works to digitize (48%) and by smaller sized labs (46%). access to restorative design services is more often quoted by labs receiving a higher share of scan files (37%) and those producing a higher number of ortho cases with aligners (37%). access to modelling and interpretation services are more often quoted by labs with higher share of clients sending scan files (34%) and by those performing higher production of ortho cases with aligners (41%). commercial partnership is more often quoted by labs with high share of clients sending scan files (33%) and those less involved in traditional techniques (31%). labo in the uk the issue of dedicated laboratory support and access to restorative design services are the most relevant. in some countries more elements are mentioned, for example in spain and italy both training and support in providing a synergistic training path between laboratory and clinic is very important. in fact, dentists often turn to the laboratory for guidance on digital flow management. base: 594 cases lab needs in terms of training importance of training and education 45 how do you rate the importance of training and education? mean: 4,5 importance of training / education is very high throughout, even more so in southern europe. training / education is higher than average very important among smaller labs (65%). and so is for less recently open labs (64%) and for those receiving a lower share of scan files (70%). again, it is higher than average very important for those who think that ios scans have had a positive impact on the laboratory business (62%). where digitalization rate is lower, the perception that training is very important increases (expansion phase). labo base: 594 cases cases 137 114 125 113 105 4,4 4,1 4,7 4,7 4,3 attended type of trainings 46 what types of trainings do you attend? how often (no. of days)? average days per year (base: respondents attending training events) almost all respondents attend training sessions. training penetration is over 90% in all countries, with peaks in uk and germany, where it is over 95%. training days dedicated to learning new techniques or training on sw and equipment are higher than lectures at industry events. bigger sized labs and those performing ortho cases with aligners do spend more days than average. more digitized labs are those spending higher than average days. smaller labs, being them also less digitized, spend less days a year. those considering digitization of the lab has an impact on the lab staff, are also spending more days than average on training. labo base: 594 cases 137 114 125 113 105 desired types of training 47 what types of trainings would you be interested in? (open answer, not consolidated) labo base: 594 cases learning new techniques and digital workflow are the most sought-after topics. digital workflow and techniques for using cad-cam are among the main topics researched in the courses, along with improving knowledge of new techniques and materials. *big labs with more than 15 technicians employed all big labs * de fr it es uk procedures new techniques and materials 24% 4% 31% 19% 31% 15% 21% cad-cam techniques and methods 14% 19% 11% 11% 10% 14% 20% cad design 13% 17% 13% 25% 17% 10% 0% digital workflow in general 13% 5% 12% 9% 12% 13% 15% in-depth knowledge of the software / equipment 12% 3% 13% 5% 6% 16% 16% 3d printing techniques and materials 5% 15% 5% 10% 3% 3% 3% improvement of the productivity 5% 12% 6% 2% 0% 6% 8% business / marketing management 3% 11% 1% 2% 6% 3% 2% customized training for my lab 3% 6% 3% 0% 0% 4% 7% live demo/hands on 1% 6% 2% 0% 0% 3% 0% other 2% 1% 0% 1% 4% 1% don't know / no answer 6% 2% 11% 6% 6% 3% nothing 4% 4% 1% 6% 6% 4% 2% time and money per year to dedicate to education 48 how much time are you willing to dedicate to your own and your staff education (number of days per year)? how much money are you willing to spend (per year) on your own and your staff education?",

13 in the practices with higher performance increases the number of prostheses and restorations produced using cad-cam, in the practices whose monthly expense for materials is higher than 900 euros (26%) and in the practices where more than 50 implants per year are placed (31%). in the practices with an improved business management the regular offer of prostheses and restorations produced using cad-cam is higher: in the practices having a marketing plan (30%) compared with practices that do not have it (17%). in the practices where the owner's age is less than 45 years (28%). in the practices with more than 3 equivalent dentists (31%). among dentists that answered to the questionnaire through internet, the percentage increases slightly, while there are no differences based on the practice pricing policy. just 20% proposes regularly (always or almost always) digital workflow prostheses. random sample base: 455 cases total sample cad-cam prostheses offer among those proposing digital work flow ones how do you use cad-cam technologies at your practice, according to the following modalities? 14 in the practices with an improved management, the offer of prostheses produced through scanner only and chairside milling is higher compared to the practices with a more traditional management: respectively the sample stands at 11% and 7%. the trend to own an intraoral scanner and a chairside milling unit is a feature of practices with better performances, and respectively 21% and 11% of practices in the last year have placed more than 50 implants. the chairside milling is more present among surgeries with more than 3 chairs (9%); the same trend features those having only the intraoral scanner (17%). 79% of the practices with more than 3 chairs send the impressions and the model outside, versus 95% of those practices with one chair. the ownership of this kind of equipment still is a marginal matter random sample base: 354 cases cad-cam restorations providers experience with the intraoral scanner how long do you have the intraoral scanner? 15 basically, the practices performing better purchased the intraoral scanner more than one year ago (36% of the practices placing more than 50 implants per year). the larger practices with a number of dental chairs higher than three, have purchased the intraoral scanner more than two years ago. the same phenomenon is observed with the number of dentists, where about 40% of the practices with more than 3 dentists state to have purchased the intraoral scanner more than two years ago. about one third of the installed equipment seem to be purchased in the last year. random sample base: 45 cases scanner owners dentists' opinions towards digital technologies opinion regarding cad-cam technologies what is your position with regard to the digital technologies (especially intra-oral scanning and/or chairside milling) according to the following definitions? 17 among the best performing practices the stance versus the cad-cam technologies improves: the overall opinion is the need to get closer to keep the pace of the innovation. also among the practices with a more evolved business management the opinion improves in comparison to the surgeries with a more traditional management, in particular, for those stating to have a business development plan. more discomfort: in the practices where the practices owner is higher than 55 years (38%) in the mono dental practices or just two dental chairs (33% and 36%) random sample base: 455 cases total sample opinion regarding cad-cam technologies what is your position with regard to the digital technologies (especially intra-oral scanning and/or chairside dental milling) according to the following definitions? 18 the discomfort is more present and seems to prevail regarding economical and conceptual matters. random sample base: 455 cases total sample weight: 22% weight: 68% weight: 10% 57% of those not offering digital work flow prosthesis, not even in outsourcing mode, named no digital users (weighting about one fourth of the sample), feel discomfort with the digital technologies. also those offering digital work flow prosthesis, even in outsourcing mode, at least one out of four (26%) feel discomfort, while those having a digital technology - only one out of 10 - declare to have troubles with that kind of technologies. influence of cad-cam technology for the production of the prostheses how do you feel the digital technologies (cad-cam and 3d printing) will affect how the prostheses are performed? 19 random sample base: 455 cases total sample the practices with higher performance and with a monthly expenditure higher than 900 euros estimate that the cad-cam technology will replace completely the traditional prosthesis (69%). there are no significant differences within the socio-demographic sample stratification. also regarding the stratification by kind of business management doesnt show relevant statistical differences versus the overall sample average. influence of cad-cam technology for the production of the prostheses how do you feel the digital technologies (cad-cam and 3d printing) will affect how the prostheses are performed? 20 random sample base: 455 cases total sample its interesting to note how also among no digital users, that is no digital workflow, not even in outsourcing, more than 50% state that the future will only be digital prosthetics. influence of cad-cam technology for the production of the prostheses how do you feel the digital technologies (cad-cam and 3d printing) will affect how prosthetics is performed? 21 random sample base: 455 cases total sample without taking into account 2% of the sample which thinks that the future of the digital prosthesis will not prevail, and crossing the comfort situation with the perception regarding the future of the digital prosthesis, two main topics arise: despite the digital work flow prosthesis will have an important role, even not completely replacing the traditional one, more than 40% feel discomfort regarding the technologies. also among those thinking that the digital prosthesis will completely replace the traditional one, one out of four feels uncomfortable about those technologies. in both situation, a possible frustration from the users can be highlighted. those users may need help from both the manufacturers and the scientific world to ease the path towards a higher familiarity with the digital technologies. future purchase intention intention to buy are you willing/interested in buying an intraoral scanner or a cad-cam chairside milling within 2 years? excluding practices that already possess cad-cam technologies 23 the practices with better performances declare a higher attitude to the purchase of a cad-cam system: practices spending more than 900 a month (50%); those placing more than 50 implants a year (53%). a higher attitude to purchase the cad-cam technology comes from both the clinics with dentists younger than 55 (38% for dentists younger than 45 and 36% for dentists aged between 45 and 55); and for practices with bigger size, with more than 3 chairs (47%). certainly yes + probably yes 33% random sample base: 410 cases non owners intention to buy are you willing/interested in buying an intraoral scanner or a cad-cam chairside milling within 2 years? excluding practices that already possess cad-cam technologies 24 random sample base: 410 cases non owners the purchase intention is double among those who already uses the full outsourcing, compared to those who do not offer digital work flow prostheses 38% vs 17%. the analysis of the sample stratification allows for a precise profiling of the potential buyers to develop marketing activities on, in order to increase demand generation. intention to buy: intraoral scanner vs. chairside milling unit 25 among those keen to invest in the cad- cam technologies, almost all of them declare their willingness to purchase an intraoral scanner in the next future. in the purchase intention for certainly and probably the difference is huge. in those cases, it is the offer pulling on the demand certainly certainly + probably base: 135 cases potential clients random sample base: 410 cases non owners intention to buy are you willing/interested in buying an intraoral scanner or a cad-cam chairside milling within 2 years? (yes/no) 26 random sample base: 410 cases non owners primary target profile they are basically web respondents (double the intention to buy versus the phone respondents, slightly higher for the chairside milling), subscribers to sector newsletters, rather independent and with not loyal relationships with the dealers. the dentists from the south of italy are those showing the higher interest, where, however, those technologies are less widespread, in particular the chairside milling, with an intention to buy which is double the average. the target focus is between 46 and 55 years old, the younger ones (up to 45) are more oriented to the scanner and the older ones (more than 55) to the chairside milling. with specific regard to the chairside milling, the core target is the practice open for more than 20 years. despite there is a direct correlation between the size and the intention to buy, the big sized practice with at least 3-4 chairs and several consultants is more oriented towards the purchase of a scanner and far less to the chairside milling, which seems to be more interesting to a mid-sized practice with 2-3 chairs, which in the future may recur to the partnership with an internal technician. the specialized practices seem to be more oriented to make the investment (47% specialized practices vs 25% general ones), in specific prosthetics and implant dentistry with more than 50 implants placed a year (52% vs 33% overall average). those interested to the chairside milling do show a lower attitude to the strategic planning, which is contrary to those interested in the scanner. in the imagery of the dentists more oriented to the purchase, the most quoted brands, for those willing to buy a scanner are most of all 3m followed by 3shape (even though sirona is always the first one in the intention to buy), while among those keen to invest in a chairside milling the most quoted brand is sirona. intention to buy: probably/certainly no why you probably/certainly no?",

29 random sample for both technologies is rather high the weight of dont know, and in the case of the chairside milling, also brands without cad-cam equipment are mentioned. the scanner seems to be a more competitive market with the co-leaders evenly performing in the mental basket for the choice of the equipment. base: 135 cases interested in purchasing chairside milling scanner demand for services to support the investment in cad-cam what should a cad-cam technology manufacturer offer to enhance / improve the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your clinic? 30 random sample the spontaneous answers, among them the most quoted ones are affordability and better financial conditions, have been aggregated according to their nature into five areas and considering the responses instead of the respopndents as the base, with the exclusion of dont know and not interested. this data processing allows for further comparison among the different clusters. base: 455 cases total sample demand for services to support the investment in cad-cam what should a cad-cam technology manufacturer offer to enhance / improve the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your clinic? aggregated basis of response 31 random sample base: 455 cases total sample very interesting to evaluate the different approach of the respondents via phone versus those responding via web. the latter ones (which show a bigger size) is far less attentive to the economical aspect and more interested to the support and training, other than marketing. from a demographic and structural perspective, the younger respondents show a higher interest in the economical matters, which is also true for those showing a lower than average production performances. its interesting to note as the attitude towards the use of the technologies increases, the interest in the support and marketing increases as well, which a lower importance of the economical aspects. demand for services to support the investment in cad-cam what should a cad-cam technology manufacturer offer to enhance / improve the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your clinic? aggregated basis of response 32 random sample the analysis on the investment attitude, some interesting points emerge, because among those declaring an interest to the purchase, the attention to the economical aspects greatly reduces, while increases that on support and training (65% versus 26% of the rejectors) and a higher demand for assistance in practice from those thinking about a possible purchase (46% vs 18%). this is even more evident among those interested in the purchase of a chairside milling. also, they are more interested in the marketing support (almost double versus the ones interested in the purchase of the scanner only) to foster the demand from the patients. as for the economical matters, those interested in the chairside milling dont ask for a price reduction, but easier financial conditions or pay per use options. base: 135 cases interested in purchasing brand awareness analysis cad-cam manufacturers: unaided awareness what manufacturers of digital technologies (scanners, cad-cam, 3d print, etc.) come to your mind? 34 random sample the comparison between unaided awareness and top of mind highlights relevant differences in the ability of a brand to represent its own product family, which is shown by the ratio called prominence. a higher prominence value means a higher ability to represent the analysed product family: this in fact is the ratio between the first mentioned brand top of mind and the unaided awareness. the sum of unaided awareness responses represents the average number of brands mentioned by each interviewees: in this case the sum of percentages is 145%, that means the interviewees have mentioned about 1,5 brands. its interesting to note that about 50% of the interviewees did not mention any brand, which is a clear sign of this market being a rather immature one, almost a niche. sirona is absolute brand awareness leader in this segment. base: 455 cases total sample 0,74 0,50 0,48 0,27 0,48 0,55 0,29 0,33 0,22 0,73 sirona 3shape 3m carestream kavo nobel biocare zirkonzahn planmeca dental wings ivoclar vivadent cad-cam manufacturers: unaided awareness what manufacturers of digital technologies (scanners, cad-cam, 3d print, etc.) come to your mind? segmentation according to technology orientation 35 random sample base: 455 cases total sample the low brand awareness is a specific feature of cad- cam non-owners and in particular, it belongs to those not even using the full outsourcing methodology. among the owners, the weight of the four top brands increases relevantly. cad-cam manufacturers: total awareness please tell me if you know the following brands? 36 random sample as for the total awareness, the values increase a lot, in particular for the brands with a relevant business also in other product categories. the relevance index (it is the relationship between unaided awareness and the total one) it is important because highlights the brands ability to be recalled spontaneously by the respondents in connection to the category, so is potentially very influential when they need to take a buying decision. the low relevance indexes shows the scarce ability of all brands to be associated to the cad-cam segment. base: 455 cases total sample 36% 13% 11% 8% 2% 1% 93% 47% 79% 58% 75% 21% sirona 3shape 3m carestream planmeca align technology serie1 serie2 pqi index 0,39 0,28 0,13 0,14 0,03 0,03 sirona 3shape 3m carestream planmeca align technology random sample base: 455 cases total sample sirona 3shape 3m carestream planmeca align technology relevance (strength of the brand in the category) prominence (capacity of the brand to represent the product category) + + cad-cam manufacturers: relevance vs. prominence 37 the map of relevance/prominence highlights the brand's capacity to come to the dentist's mind when talking about a given product category (relevance) and the brand's ability to be mentioned spontaneously (prominence). in the b2b market, the prominence is closely linked to the use of the products, while the relevance expresses the probability of a brand to be considered in the purchase process. therefore, in the upper right side of the map there are brands with above average ability to be recalled spontaneously and more representative of the cad-cam category. in the lower right side of the map there are brands with a lower than average ability to be spontaneously recalled to mind (generally less wide spread), but compared to the average, they are more associated with the category in analysis. brand awareness, market category association regarding the brands you mentioned, please specify : overall scenario 38 random sample only 3shape resulted to be almost completely linked to the cad-cam segment, while for other important international brands, such as planmeca, carestream, 3m, etc. more than half of the sample dont know that they produce cad-cam equipment. base: for each brand, those having mentioned it spontaneously brand awareness, market category association brand association index to the category of cad-cam overall scenario random sample low association to cad-cam high low overall awareness high base: for each brand, those having mentioned it spontaneously the representativeness of the segment is very relevant when a big portion of the potential demand is still to fully develop, so that a secondary data processing has been performed, which evaluated with a different weight the three possible options: i know this brand as a manufacturer of cad-cam equipment (high representativeness) i know this brand as a manufacturer of both cad-cam equipment and other products ( medium representativeness) i know this brand as manufacturer of products which are different from cad-cam equipment (no representativeness) thanks to this processing it is possible to show a map where the information regarding the capability of a brand to be associated to the cad-cam segment is shown. the size of the bubbles represents the brands capacity to be associated to the cad-cam sector. brand positioning cad-cam manufacturers numeric distribution: intraoral scanner and chairside milling what model and brand of intraoral scanner you use to take digital impressions? 41 random sample numeric distribution it is the percentage of clients that mentioned to use a certain product / brand, or to get delivered by a certain supplier, not necessarily in an exclusive way. this section is placed in the brand perception because it is heavily affected by the brand penetration. please consider that on the random sample; only 45 scanners users have been found, for this reason the numeric distribution is shown for qualitative purposes only. as for the chairside milling, only 17 users have been found in the random sample, so that it is not possible to investigate the numeric distribution, even though 80% of the users quoted sirona. numeric distribution intraoral scanner base: 45 cases owners scanner brand image how much do you agree the following statements are relevant to the brands that im going to read out to you? please, use a scale where 1 stands for completely disagree and 10 stands for completely agree. the charts show the difference between the total sample responding to this question and those who know sirona. with a high number of quotes, sirona performance can be considered quite similar to that of the overall random sample. clusters 10 completely agree 8-9 rather agree 6-7 rather disagree 1-5 completely disagree random sample sirona (154 quotes) mean total sample (370 quotes) 42 brand image how much do you agree the following statements are relevant to the brands that im going to read out to you?

(very high most of all among those responding via web), while it decreases steadily the autonomous information collection. reasons to buy spontaneous statements what was the main reason that made you decide to buy a cad-cam equipment? base: 105 cases owners owners sample the most prevailing motivations are a kind of subjective ones, linked to an innovation concept (trust in the technology and willingness to be at the forefront). a relevant weight is also from the aspects related to the performance improvement and the quality of the results. less relevant is the desire of independence from the laboratory, not very high among scanners users. base 126 responses among the different unaided answers the trust in the future prevails, but also some practical aspect (time reduction and higher accuracy). the answers have been aggregated according to their own nature and into four different areas, whose data processing have been made on the sum of answers. this aggregation allows for some further interesting consideration . please note again that 70% of the sample owns a chairside milling. 50 reasons to buy objective analysis on the proposed items how much do you agree with the following statements about the moment you decided to invest in a cad-cam? please give me a score from 1 to 10, where 1 stands for strongly disagree and 10 stands for totally agree. 51 base: 105 cases owners owners sample mean following the unaided answers, some items have been investigated, which allowed the selection of true purchasing drivers. also in this case, the emotional approach of the orientation to the future prevails . it is a typical attitude of the pioneers belonging to a newly born product segment. clusters 10 completely agree 8-9 rather agree 6-7 rather disagree 1-5 completely disagree reasons to buy a cad-cam equipment factor analysis 52 owners sample the factor analysis identified 4 latent factors for the reasons to buy a cad-cam equipment. better performance: represents the performance improvement seen as economic benefits and increased productivity. image and innovation: this factor summarizes the feeling that owning a cad-cam equipment improves the image of the clinic to the eyes of the patients. patient care: owning a cad-cam technology allows to treat the patients in less time than traditional methods, improving their comfort. independence from the lab: a cad-cam allows the practice to be independent from the lab. base: 105 cases owners the factor analysis is a multi- variate statistical analysis used to investigate and give explanation of the correlations among a given number of variables. thanks to a given number of known variables (in this case the reasons to buy), the factor analysis finds out some latent factors being able to statistically summarize the explicit variables. better performance image and innovation patient care independence from the lab the acquisition of a cad-cam will reduce the working time 0,79 the

owners sample age: basically the elders resulted to be less sensitive to the performance improvement. size structure: the smallest practices seem to be more influenced by the improvement of the reputation of the practice. value of purchases in materials: the segment with a lower than average expenditure are more sensitive to the image and also to the increased independence from the lab. implantology: this is the segmentation showing the biggest differences in the purchasing behaviour. base: 105 cases owners all factors have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, the histograms shows the

strategic business plan resulted to be more interested in the performance and far less to the independence from the lab. the other 2 drivers did not show statistically relevant differences. type of technology the kind of technology used shows a different mapping: to the only scanner users, the image and innovation perspective prevail, while the chairside milling users seem to be motivated by the independence from the lab and a higher attention to the patient care. other significant aspects those having purchased the equipment in an emotional way is strongly influenced by the image and not interested at all to the independence from the lab. the cad-cam frequent users are more oriented to the performance and the image. base: 105 cases owners all factors have mean 0 and standard deviation

important benefits in using the intraoral scanner? 56 base: 45 cases scanner owners the most quoted advantage, with more than 50% of the quotes, is the reduction of working times, related to the improvement of the productivity and the performance. the second most quoted advantage is the high precision of the digital impression, which is related to the aspects of precision and quality of the performance. random sample chairside milling unit benefits spontaneous statements what are the most important benefits in using the chairside milling unit? 57 base: 17 cases chairside milling owners the main quoted benefit is the reduction of working times, linked to the aspects of the surgery performance. the second quoted advantage is the possibility to make indirect restorations in one single visit. considering that the third quoted advantage (depend less upon the lab), is partially linked to the surgery performance, the main advantage in the use of the chairside milling are related to the increase of the productivity and the performance. random sample loyalty metrics cad-cam satisfaction analysis evaluate the overall experience with a brand and how much the customer needs are met. perceived value the utility and benefit of a product relative to the price paid for that product. advocacy the willingness of a user to recommend a company to colleagues is a key driver of revenue and profit growth in most industries. repurchase intention the likelihood a user will continue to use a companys products in the near future. brand advocacy score (b.a.s.) respondents are categorized as either advocates, neutrals, or detractors for each brand. the bas subtracts the percent share of detractors from the percent share of advocates, to show net impact on word-of-mouth referrals. 59

how likely are you to recommend the cad-cam products of the following companies to a colleague? if you were to replace your current cad-cam system, how likely are you to buy the same brand again? b.a.s.* the risk of abandonment derives from the assumption that a low repurchase intention may mean a risk that, in the future, the product may not be purchased again. lower repurchase intention scores have a higher risk of abandonment, while higher values mean that a current customer will likely still be using this product in the future. even if the perceived value is negative, this item does not impact on the attitude to recommend or on the repurchase intention. this is to confirm once again the low weight of the price in the real experience. advocates neutrals detractors base: 52

clusters 10 completely satisfied 8-9 rather satisfied 6-7 rather not satisfied 1-5 not satisfied at all 62 bivariate correlation analysis the bivariate correlation analysis is a technique that helps to identify and measure the influence of the independent variables on the dependent one (in this case, the overall satisfaction). the bivariate correlation analysis has been used to quantify the relation between the score on the single satisfaction items and the rating on the overall satisfaction. therefore, it is possible to retrieve a hierarchy of importance from the individual statements and to display them in a chart, and then on a map. the vertical axis always shows the satisfaction ratings that the different factors have received, on average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence on the overall satisfaction. in this way, its obtained an estimated importance of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a bit different from the one explicitly stated. the analysis of the weight of each of the factors, and not only of the declared importance, allows for some interesting considerations. the items have a different meaning according to the point of view with which they are considered: 63 statistical note satisfaction related to the whole market here, some prerequisites are highlighted (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors satisfy the market), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, where companies are not always able to satisfy customers with regard to strategic issues), and indifference areas (lower-left side of the map) which become waste/not efficient areas when a company decides to invest in those items belonging to the upper-left side of the map, since they tend to satisfy the market but they actually dont affect the overall satisfaction at all. satisfaction related to a specific company/product here the scheme is the same, but we can highlight the strength points in the upper-right side of the map, which can determine inefficiency or indifference if placed in the left side of the map. in the lower-right we can note an improvement area, where we can find the weak points of a certain company (higher than average weight on the company satisfaction but lower than average satisfaction score). satisfaction analysis ranking of importance of items ranking of importance of items. whole sample 64 in this chart the correlation of the individual items with the overall satisfaction of cad-cam equipment is presented. it takes into account the total sample. some items with a low correlation score might not be useful to the construction of the satisfaction and vice versa. only start up training resulted to be particularly critical in the analysed model, in addition to the issues on the update and management. weight per item on the satisfaction score mean whole sample (172 quotes) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 overall ranking satisfaction analysis

the scanner highlight a ranking similar to the overall one, even though some items resulted to be more important, such as the handiness, the updates and, partially, the business development support and, most of all, the technical support. far less correlated the aspects linked to the software. satisfaction analysis ranking of importance of items. chairside milling owner 66 weight per item on the

results shows a higher importance than the product reliability. far more important the aspects linked to the training, software use and cost updates. lower importance for the frequency of the software updates. weight on the satisfaction items score + + satisfaction analysis whole sample 67 the map is the visual synthesis of the charts seen in previous slides. the horizontal axis is the weight on the satisfaction (that is, the correlation score) of each item; the vertical axis is the average satisfaction scores of the different items. the satisfaction items are positioned so that: a) the items in the upper right side of the map are important in terms of both overall satisfaction and b) the respondents are more than average satisfied. in the lower right side of the map there are the items that: a) are very important in the construction of the overall satisfaction and b) the respondents are less satisfied than average, this is a critical zone because it represent an improvement area, with a high impact on the satisfaction and a poor performance of the product/brand. loyalty prerequisites key success factors in loyalty weight on the satisfaction + items score + satisfaction analysis scanner vs chairside milling key success factors in loyalty key success factors in loyalty scanner chairside milling the two satisfaction models scanner vs chairside milling, are very similar, even though in overall a higher weight of the items for the chairside milling can be noted (therefore higher expectations), in particular the greater relative importance of two areas: the wide range of materials (prerequisite for the chairside milling) and the overall operating costs (including software updates) which are instead critical points and represent an area of opportunity for the companies. 68 satisfaction analysis factor analysis 69 the factor analysis allows to find out 4 latent factors: product quality: the factor is characterized by those items that relate on one side to the practical usage of cad-cam and, on the other, the aspects of the software and the ease of use of the interface. it partially includes the operating costs that are partially experienced as an integral part of quality. customer support services : includes all aspects of the relationship between the company and the user regarding the technical service and after sales. running cost: refers to the aspects not related to the purchase cost but to the overall running costs for the use of the equipment and the software over time. training: the factor refers to the education and training of the dentist and the support in the use of the equipment after the purchase. owners sample the factor analysis is a multi-variate statistical analysis used to investigate and give explanation of the correlations among a given number of variables. thanks to a given number of known variables (in this case the reasons to buy), the factor analysis finds out some latent factors being able to statistically summarize the explicit variables. satisfaction analysis users stratification 70 owners sample owners sample all factors have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, the histograms shows the average scores of the factors for the shown information. as anticipated in the correlation analysis, the satisfaction model for both technologies resulted to be reliable. the analysis on the factors scores show an overall less satisfactory situation for the chairside milling. particularly critical are the training and the customer support services. it is a matter of understanding, thanks to specific deepening, if the chairside milling critical points are to be attributed to weak spots in the manufacturer service, the distribution system or specific difficulties in the world of the chairside systems. satisfaction analysis linear regression 71 the product quality has the highest weight on the satisfaction, both in the overall model and for the scanner users. with regards to the other chairside milling, the running costs and the training show the highest weight. the linear regression is a statistical technique whose aim is to find out if a causal relationship exists between one or more independent variables (in this case the factors derived from the factor analysis on the satisfaction) and one dependent variable (in this case the overall satisfaction). the linear regression requirement is that a linear relationship exists between the variables so that this relationship can be explained with a straight line. the linear regression allows to understand the intensity of the relationship between the independent and the dependent variables and to what extent each factor affects the overall satisfaction. the linear regression model shows a value r2=0,777 (r-squared), this means that about 78% of the satisfaction is explained by this model. owners sample overall satisfaction 22% customer support services 46% product quality running cost 19% training

prostheses taking into consideration the chairside milling owners only (oversampling on users), only one third of them carry out less than half of the prosthetic cases with digital work flow, while 17% of them declare to make prosthesis only with digital work flow (not necessarily all of them carried out with the chairside milling). basing on the quotes, the total prosthetic cases carried out with digital work flow is 68%. among the chairside milling users, about two thirds of all prosthetic cases are made with the digital work flow. focus on chairside milling users minutes required for digital design how many minutes do you need in general for the digital design with the cad/cam software per patient? 74 16 minutes it is the average time for the digital design. base: 77 cases total

appointment how many indirect restorations are done in your practice, in an average week? in percent, how many of your single restorations are performed in one appointment? in percent, how many of your multiple restorations are performed in one appointment? among chairside milling users, about two thirds of indirect restorations are done in one single appointment. base: 77 cases total sample percentage of practices by classes of production in one single visit in the chairside milling users sample only 14% of them dont carry out indirect restorations in one single appointment. this percentage goes up to 40% for the multiple restorations. 29% of them declares to carry out 100% of the single restorations in one single appointment. the percentages steeply decrease for multiple restorations. in overall, about 54% of the single restorations have been carried out in one appointment, while the percentage goes down to 20% for the multiple restorations. mean: 54% mean: 20% 75

13 base: 179 cases (digital prosthesis providers) prosthesis on implants with digital workflow clinic digital production share 2018 % elements produced with digital workflow 3,1 100,0% elements for prosthesis on implants 1,5 47,7% elements for traditional prosthesis 1,6 52,3% total (digital prosthesis providers) 179 almost half of the interviewed dentists who provide their patients with digital prosthesis, realize part of this prosthesis on implants. overall, considering all the elements produced with digital workflow, 48% is for prosthesis on implants. this figure decreases slightly among the scanner owners and users. digital production share considering all indirect restorations (crowns, bridges, inlays, onlays, veneers) produced at your practice, please tell us the percentage of them produced with digital workflow even with full outsourcing service, and the percentage produced with traditional techniques. 14 percentage of indirect restorations clinic overall production share 2018 % indirect restorations 4,7 100,0% traditional techniques 2,7 57,8% digital workflow 2,0 42,2% total (indirect restorations providers) 277 according to dentists, over a half of the overall production is produced with traditional techniques. digital production share considering all indirect restorations (crowns, bridges, inlays, onlays, veneers) produced at your practice, please tell us the percentage of them produced with digital workflow even with full outsourcing service, and the percentage produced with traditional techniques. 15 clinic segmentation by used technology the digital production is higher among the owners of a digital equipment, especially those with a chairside milling unit. these figures differ from what dental technicians declared in the survey targeting dental laboratories, where the overall production share is made of 56% of elements performed with digital workflow and 44% with traditional techniques. this difference could be explained by the fact that dentists do not know how the external laboratory handles the requested works. percentage of indirect restorations use of digital technologies in dental laboratories do you provide your customers with fixed prosthetics elements produced with digital technologies (also in full outsourcing)? base: 600 cases (whole sample) percentage of laboratories the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. labo 16 cad-cam users 1 technician (51%) 3 or more technicians (90%) up to 4 served practices (57%) 5 or more served practices (83%) 70% of the respondents declare to use the digital workflow. the penetration is higher among bigger sized labs and those serving a higher number of practices. the trend analysis show an ever growing trend in the use of this technology. fixed prosthesis production share considering all the ceramics elements for fixed prosthesis produced in your laboratory, please tell us the percentage of them produced with the following framework materials and techniques. percentage of elements production share by framework material production share by technique labo with the development of digital technologies, the weight of indirect metalceramics restorations has not drastically reduced, contrary to what is happening in other countries where all ceramics has a greater share. anyway, over a half of the ceramics elements are produced with digital techniques. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. 17 fixed prosthesis production share considering all the ceramics elements for fixed prosthesis produced in your laboratory, please tell us the percentage of them produced with the following framework materials. framework materials labo percentage of elements the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. 18 the deepening by type of material highlights a structural change that led to the reduction of traditional techniques, casted metal precious/non-precious alloys frames in particular, in favor of digital ones, with a high increase in aesthetic cad-cam frames. cad-cam elements for prosthesis on implants considering all elements produced with digital workflow (also full outsourcing), what percentage is produced for prosthesis on implants? labo percentage of elements 92% of the interviewed laboratories (which produce prostheses with digital workflow) perform prosthesis on implants. 83% of cad-cam elements are produced for prosthesis on implants, the remaining 17% for traditional prosthesis. percentage of laboratories prosthesis on implants cad-cam production share 2018 % elements produced with cad-cam 10,3 100,0% elements for prosthesis on implants 8,5 82,6% elements for traditional prosthesis 1,8 17,4% total (providers of cad-cam elements) 417 19 scenario stance and opinions about digital technologies in dentistry change in the way restorations are performed in your opinion, does the use of the digital technology change the type of restorations? if yes, which way? 21 clinic change in the way restorations are performed two predicted changes are more correlated with the arrival of the digital prosthesis: evolution of the materials or differentiation increase in the weight of the fixed prosthesis vs the removable one role of digital technologies on prosthetics in the future how do you feel the new digital technologies will affect the way the prosthetics is carried out in your country? dental practices laboratories clinic + labo the belief that digital technologies can totally replace analog ones is 73% for those who already supply digital prosthesis, compared to 44% of those who are still reluctant. for laboratories, the awareness of the total replacement of the traditional prosthesis with the digital one is much more widespread: 68% of those who already provide it and 56% of those who dont. 22 role of dentists and technicians in the future how do you think dentists and technicians role will change with the new digital technologies? 23 dental practices laboratories the feeling that dentists could over time acquire technician skills is widespread and transversal for 40% of the sample, however, it reduces to 25% for technicians who have a high level of technological equipment. clinic + labo more than a half of dentists are optimistic about improving the relationship with technicians, although around 30% believe that some processes (or phases) may overlap. this is especially true for chairside owners (46%), however, it drastically reduces among those who already send scans to the laboratory (8%). stance versus digital technologies what is your stance versus the digital technologies? 24 dental practices laboratories clinic + labo in the dental pratices that still dont provide digital prosthesis, the feeling of discomfort and attitudinal distance rises to 52%. the problem is even more noticeable in the laboratories that still dont provide digital works, even in outsourcing, with a feeling of unease that rises to 65%. the situation is completely different for those who already use the technologies which, unlike dentists, seem to be more at ease. required features from digital technology providers what should your digital technology provider offer you, to improve and enhance the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your laboratory? 25 dental practices laboratories clinic + labo 3d printing the report presents alternatively the results of the dental practices sample (clinic) and laboratories sample (labo) main consequences in dentistry brought by 3d printing to what extent do you agree on the following statements, with regard to the main consequences that 3d printing will bring to the dentistry?

analysis glossary unaided awareness it represents the entire group of brands of a certain product family, recalled by the interviewed sample. within the boundaries of spontaneous awareness, the consumer reasonably decides to make a purchase. aided awareness and total awareness the aided awareness represents the awareness level of the brands named by the interviewer. the total awareness is made up of the unaided awareness and by the aided one. the aided awareness shows how many respondents identify the brand once it is quoted, it is an important index in the buying process but, if it is not sustained by a high level of unaided awareness, the company needs more efforts to reach a better commercial effectiveness. top of mind it is the first brand, named by the interviewee, related to a certain product family. it is the closest indicator to the intention to buy or to the current use of the products and it is strictly linked to the brand value. prominence index it is the relationship between top of mind and unaided awareness; it is an indicator of knowledge quality and it estimates the brand capability to represent the product family to those who know it, regardless its overall awareness. relevance index it is the relationship between unaided awareness and the aided one. it defines the brand capability to be recalled whenever the customer decides to make a purchase. 35

of brands of a certain product family, recalled by the interviewed sample. within the boundaries of spontaneous awareness, the consumer reasonably decides to make a purchase. the overlap index represents the number of mentioned brands. dentsply sirona shows a reduced awareness level, but still is the leading brand. on another hand, 3shape and carestream awareness has grown considerably. digital equipment brands: unaided awareness thinking about the equipment to produce indirect restorations with digital workflow, what brands come to your mind? base: 600 cases (whole sample) labo 37 the comparison between the \"unaided awareness\" and the \"top of mind\", highlights relevant differences in the prominence index: a higher index value indicates the brand's ability to represent a product family. example: 3shape is known by 21% of the respondents as a brand and 74% of those who know the brand have mentioned it as the first brand. trend analysis digital equipment brands: unaided awareness overlap index: 1,39 1,63 labo 38 spontaneous awareness (unaided): it represents the entire group of brands of a certain product family, recalled by the interviewed sample. within the boundaries of spontaneous awareness, the consumer reasonably decides to make a purchase. top of mind: it represents the number of times a certain brand was mentioned as the first one by a respondent. 3shape, dentsply sirona and zirkonzahn confirm their leadership, but new competitors are growing, such as amann girrbach, roland, nobil metal and open technologies. this is even more evident when the top of mind is analysed: a relevant number of companies are increasing their top of mind score. unaided awareness top of mind digital equipment brands: unaided awareness vs. prominence index map thinking about the equipment to produce indirect restorations with digital workflow, what brands come to your mind? labo 39 the map relates quantitative awareness data (unaided awareness) with a qualitative index that expresses the brand attitude to be immediately associated with the product category (prominence). in the upper right side of the map there are brands with an unaided awareness above the average one and higher immediate association to the product category. 3shape is the brand that is more associated with digital workflow equipment. other brands like ivoclar vivadent, nobil metal or egs show a lower unaided awareness, but a higher prominence index, so that they are more often considered to be representative of this category by the respondents who have mentioned them. - unaided awareness + prominence + digital equipment brands: total awareness for each of the following brands, please state if you know it. 40 base: 281 cases (whole sample) clinic total awareness represents a consolidation between aided awareness and unaided awareness. it is interesting to underline that some brands like 3m, ivoclar vivadent, gc, kavo and straumann show a high percentage of quotes related to the awareness due to other product categories. 3shape and dentsply sirona show among the highest values of awareness related to the manufacturing of cad-cam equipment. *align

highest values of awareness related to the manufacturing of cad-cam equipment. digital equipment brands: total awareness in digital segment for each of the following brands, please state if you know it (as a cad-cam manufacturer). 42 base: 281 cases (whole sample) clinic the relevance index is important because highlights the capability of a brand to be recalled spontaneously to mind by respondents, thus potentially, when they need to take a decision for purchase. it is interesting to note the quite high total awareness of dentsply sirona and 3shape, which, at the same time, do show high levels of spontaneous digital awareness so that the resulting relevance index is higher than average. notoriet spontanea vs. notoriet complessiva nel segmento digitale per ognuna delle seguenti

cad-cam manufacturer). base: 600 cases (whole sample) 45 the map showing the total awareness and the relevance highlights that 3shape, while not having the highest total awareness value, is the brand which more than others can be recalled spontaneously to mind. other cad-cam specific brands such as roland and open technologies, while being far lower than zirkonzahn and dentsply sirona in terms of total awareness, do show similar values of relevance. - total awareness digital + relevance + labo digital equipment brands: total awareness vs. total awareness digital map for each of the following brands, please state if you know it. 46 the map shows on the vertical axis the total awareness generally speaking, not strictly related to the digital segment, while on the horizontal one there is the ratio between the total awareness focused on the digital segment and the total awareness broadly speaking. the resulting map shows some brands whose total awareness in the digital segment has a high weight on their total awareness broadly speaking. this is true for those brand traditionally related to the digital world. it is interesting to note how some brands, clearly identified as to belong to the digital world, in order to increase their performance, should work on the level of their total awareness broadly speaking (thus moving from the lower to the upper side of the map), and some others, already having a high total awareness, should increase their awareness in the digital world, thus moving towards right in the here shown map. - total awareness + incidence total awareness

measure the influence of the independent variables (in this case, current and former users) on the dependent one (in this case, the recommendation). the bivariate correlation analysis has been used to quantify the relation between the score on the single items and the rating on the recommendation. therefore, it is possible to retrieve a hierarchy of importance from the individual statements and to display them in a chart, and then on a map. the vertical axis always shows the scores that the different items have received, on average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence on the recommendation. in this way, its obtained an estimated importance of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a bit different from the one explicitly stated. the analysis of the weight of each of the factors, and not only of the declared importance, allows for some interesting considerations. the items have a different meaning according to the point of view with which they are considered: statistical note recommendation related to the whole market here we can highlight some prerequisites (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors perform positively), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, where companies are not always able to meet the expectations with regard to strategic issues), and indifference areas (lower-left side of the map) which become waste/not efficient areas when a company decides to invest in those items belonging to the upper-left side of the map, since they show a lower weight on the recommendation. recommendation related to a specific company/product here the scheme is the same, but we can highlight the strength points in the upper-right side of the map, which can determine inefficiency or indifference if placed in the left side of the map. in the lower-right we can note an improvement area, where we can find the weak points of a certain company (higher than average item weight on the recommendation but lower than average item score). 53 items importance average score not significant brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? overall brands 54 the charts show the weight of the items on the propensity to recommend a given brand, and on the right, their individual score. reliability, trust and reputation are the items showing the highest correlation with the recommendation. the items related to the pricing have low or no impact on the recommendation. analyzing the main brands, dentsply sirona model is very similar to the general one, with the exception of good price quality ratio, thus becoming a strategic item, being ranked as one of the top items, but with a lower than the average evaluation score. as for 3shape the item focused on the reputation received very high scores, and this item is also important in the definition of the recommendation, nevertheless, reliability and trustworthy seem not to perform on par with the mentioned item. the items makes daily practice easier and trustworthy looks to be somehow critical in carestream recommendation model, as they result to affect heavily the recommendation, but received rather weak evaluation scores. clinic brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis map how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? overall brands 55 the map is the visual result of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. on the horizontal axis there is the weight on the recommendation of each item, and on the vertical axis is the average score of each item. the items are arranged on the map so that at the top right are the items that are very important to the recommendation and that received a high score. at the bottom right there are the items very relevant to the recommendation but with a lower than average score. this map shows the items evaluated in overall and serves as a reference for the comparison with the performance of each brand. (low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) prerequisites waste/inefficiency indifference key success factors the overall analysis highlights that the customer orientation could be considered a strategic factor in the recommendation, because despite a higher than average weight on it, it resulted to perform lower than average. clinic brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? overall brands 56 the charts show the weight that the items evaluated have on the propensity to recommend a given brand, and on the right, their individual score. reliability, trust and innovation are the items showing the highest correlation with the recommendation. the items related to the pricing have low or no impact on the recommendation, even if the brand is perceived as affordable. items importance average score not significant brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis map 57 how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? overall brands the map is the visual result of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. on the horizontal axis there is the weight on the recommendation of each item, and on the vertical axis is the average score of each item. the items are arranged on the map in a way as that at the top right are the items that are very important to the recommendation and that received a high score. at the bottom right there are the items very relevant to the recommendation but with a lower than average score. this map shows the items evaluated in overall and serves as a reference for the comparison with the performance of each brand.

(scores from 1 strongly disagree to 10 strongly agree) compared to 2015, the percentage of those declaring unsatisfactory quality / price ratio decreases considerably, in favor of the area of high satisfaction, that increases by a few points. mean: 6,6 clinic base: 36 cases - 45 quotes (owners) 97 the possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores. the clustering is the following: low value/price ratio: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 1 to medium value/price ratio: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to high value/price ratio: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 9 to 10. 2015 mean: 8,1 repurchase intention score 5 years from now, how likely are you to still be using the cad-cam equipment of the following company brands? (scores from 1 definitely will not be using to 10 definitely will be using) compared to 2015, the risk of non-reuse in the future of the mentioned products increases and, at the same time, the intention to repurchase decreases. mean: 7,5 clinic base: 36 cases - 45 quotes (owners) 98 the possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores. the clustering is the following: high risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 1 to medium risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 4 to low risk: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to the defection risk derives from the assumption that a low value of repurchase intention may mean a risk that in the future the product will not be used anymore. lower scores in the repurchase intention bear a higher defection risk, while higher scores mean that a current customer will probably still be using that product also in the future. net promoter score how likely are you to recommend the following cad-cam company brands to a colleague? (scores from 0 extremely unlikely to 10 extremely likely) compared to 2015, the net promoter score improves considerably, going from 0% to 38%, thanks to the increase in the percentage of advocates and the decrease in the percentage of detractors. mean: 8,0 n.p.s.: +38% clinic base: 36 cases - 45 quotes (owners) 2015 mean: 7,5 n.p.s.: 0% 99 the possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores. the clustering is the following: detractor: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 0 to neutral: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to advocate: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 9 to customer experience and loyalty metrics in laboratories labo satisfaction score: overall brands lets consider now each one of the used cad-cam brands, please rate your satisfaction concerning the following factors. (scores from 1 completely unsatisfied to 10 completely satisfied) mean overall brands (365 quotes) labo 101 the 10 possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores among the items and the brands evaluated. the clustering is the following: not satisfied: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 1 to rather satisfied: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 7 to very satisfied: the scores grouped in this cluster are from 9 to open technologies (42 quotes) overall (365 quotes) 3shape (31 quotes) dental wings (28 quotes) amann girrbach (25 quotes) satisfaction score: focus on completely satisfied - difference from mean labo 102 bivariate correlation analysis the bivariate correlation analysis is a technique that helps to identify and measure the influence of the independent variables (in this case, current and former users) on the dependent one (in this case, the overall satisfaction). the bivariate correlation analysis has been used to quantify the relation between the score on the single satisfaction items and the rating on the overall satisfaction. therefore, it is possible to retrieve a hierarchy of importance from the individual statements and to display them in a chart, and then on a map. the vertical axis always shows the satisfaction ratings that the different factors have received, on average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence on the overall satisfaction. in this way, its obtained an estimated importance of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a bit different from the one explicitly stated. the analysis of the weight of each of the factors, and not only of the declared importance, allows for some interesting considerations. the items have a different meaning according to the point of view with which they are considered: statistical note satisfaction related to the whole market here we can highlight some prerequisites (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors satisfy the market), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, where companies are not always able to satisfy customers with regard to strategic issues), and indifference areas (lower-left side of the map) which become waste/not efficient areas when a company decides to invest in those items belonging to the upper-left side of the map, since they tend to satisfy the market but they actually dont affect the overall satisfaction at all. satisfaction related to a specific company/product here the scheme is the same, but we can highlight the strength points in the upper-right side of the map, which can determine inefficiency or indifference if placed in the left side of the map. in the lower-right we can note an improvement area, where we can find the weak points of a certain company (higher than average weight on the company satisfaction but lower than average satisfaction score). 103 the charts shows the weight that the items evaluated have on the overall satisfaction and on the right, their individual satisfaction score. accuracy and reliability showed among the highest correlation scores, but this is true for the technical assistance and the possibility to use the equipment for a wide range of materials and or procedures. overall satisfaction: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the overall satisfaction? overall brands 104 items importance satisfaction score labo overall satisfaction: correlation analysis map how much are worth the single items on the overall satisfaction? overall brands 105 the map is the visual result of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. the horizontal axis represents the weight of each item on the overall satisfaction, while the vertical axis shows the satisfaction rating of each item. at the top right of the map there are the items that are very correlated to the overall satisfaction and the respondents stated to be more than average satisfied. at the bottom right there are the items that are very correlated to the overall satisfaction, but with lower than average satisfaction scores. it is interesting to see that the frequency of sw updates and the company flexibility are key items in the construction of the overall satisfaction. (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) (low) satisfaction score (high) waste/inefficiency indifference prerequisites key success factors labo customer experience and loyalty metrics in laboratories factor analysis labo 3 factors performance relationship and support operating costs makes daily practice easier 0,750 wide range of procedures available 0,720 productivity increase 0,699 reliability 0,661 accuracy and overall quality of the restorations 0,649 handiness / ease of use 0,630 wide range of materials available 0,629 compatibility with other brands 0,512 start-up training 0,752 business development support 0,740 company availability and flexibility 0,732 technical support from the company 0,696 frequency of sw updates from the company 0,606 technical assistance in case of repair 0,594 cost of sw updates 0,813 overall running costs 0,698 overall satisfaction: factor analysis the reduction into factors allowed us to obtain 3 main factors performance relationship and support operating costs factor 1 (performance) it is about everything related to the performance of the product, such as accuracy, handiness, reliability, which reflects into the increased performance of the laboratory, with productivity increase, and an easier life in the daily practice. factor 2 (relationship and support) it is interesting to note that among the most correlated items there are start up training and business support, which are not very closely related to the technical support, whose items are indeed part of this factor, but in certain ways are felt to be important in the relationship with the brands, especially regarding this kind of equipment. factor 3 (operating costs) the third factor actually is related to the impact that the operating costs of such kind of equipment may have in the daily practice, especially when, sometimes, the software updates come at a certain price level. 107 labo overall satisfaction: factor analysis - difference from mean level of satisfaction by brand on the factors resulting from the factor analysis. - + satisfaction level 108 the displayed values represent the satisfaction level of those factors, with a value ranging from -1 to +1 where 0 represents the overall mean value. for each investigated factor, the horizontal bars represent how much the satisfaction performance differs from the overall mean (vertical axis). the significant differences from the mean are marked with a red circle, so that it is possible to focus on the most interesting topics. with this regard, it is worth to note the higher than average performance of amann girrbach regarding the factor relationship and support, while it is significant the below average performance of 3shape and dental wings in the factor operating costs. overall satisfaction: multiple regression analysis 109 in order to complete the factor analysis, it is important to also assess the weight of these factors on the overall satisfaction to understand if an improvement in one of them can also improve the satisfaction of a particular brand. therefore, these factors are used as a basis for a further analysis, called multiple regression analysis that aims to understand how they explain the overall satisfaction. the figure \"r2 = 0,629\" means that more than 60% of the total satisfaction is explained and it is based on the given factors, which is a remarkable result. the overall model shows that the weight of the performance factor is slightly less than 50%, therefore the importance of this factor is relevant. the second factor is the relationship and support, then operating costs shows the lowest weight. it is interesting to look at the following slides, when the same analysis is carried out on the single brands. overall satisfaction (r2=0,629) 45% 22% performance operating costs 33% relationship and support labo overall satisfaction: multiple regression analysis labo 110 apart from open technologies, showing a relevant weight for the factor relationship and support, it looks like the regression models of the other investigated brands is predominantly driven by the performance. with this regard, it is worth to underline that no brand showed a weak satisfaction regarding to this factor. customer experience and loyalty metrics in laboratories other indicators labo other indicators: overall satisfaction lets consider now each one of the used cad-cam brands, please rate your overall satisfaction.

14 digital prosthesis provider digital prosthesis providers age of the owner <= 45 (51%) 3 or more dental units (56%) up to 50 patients per week (37%) 50+ patients per week (52%) percentage of surgeries the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. base: 282 cases (whole sample) there is no significant change in comparison to year scenario: indirect restorations production share considering all indirect restorations (crowns, bridges, inlays, onlays, veneers) produced at your practice, please tell us the percentage of them produced with digital workflow even with full outsourcing service, and the percentage produced with traditional techniques. percentage of indirect restorations overall production share 2018 % indirect restorations 5,9 100,0% traditional techniques 3,7 62,8% digital workflow 2,2 37,2% total (indirect restorations providers) 185 15 according to dentists, over 50% of the overall production is produced with traditional techniques. these figures differ from what dental technicians declared in the survey targeting dental laboratories, where the overall production share is made of 58% of elements performed with digital workflow and 42% with traditional techniques. this difference could be explained by the fact that dentists do not know how the external laboratory handles the requested works. scenario: indirect restorations production share considering all indirect restorations (crowns, bridges, inlays, onlays, veneers) produced at your practice, please tell us the percentage of them produced with digital workflow even with full outsourcing service, and the percentage produced with traditional techniques. percentage of indirect restorations overall production share 2018 % indirect restorations 5,9 100,0% traditional techniques 3,7 62,8% digital workflow 2,2 37,2% total (indirect restorations providers) 185 16 the digital production is higher among digital technologies owners, especially those equipped with a chairside milling unit. scenario: role of digital technologies on prosthetics in the future how do you feel the new digital technologies will affect the way the prosthetics is carried out in your country? 17 2015: 201 cases the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. the perception about the evolution of the role of digital technologies is not changed in comparison to year by deepening the analysis by segments, a significant difference emerges, between digital technologies users and providers of traditional prosthetics. besides this, its interesting to note the high percentage for the statement digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics among the owners of digital equipment. base: 282 cases (whole sample) scenario: stance versus digital technologies what is your stance versus the digital technologies? 18 the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. 2015: 201 cases the situation is quite similar to the past edition, with the exception of a slight decrease in users of digital technologies who also feel comfortable. the most relevant differences in the stance versus the digital technologies can be observed between digital prosthesis providers and non providers, also, those using either a scanner or a milling unit stated not to feel uncomfortable versus the digital technologies. base: 282 cases (whole sample) scenario: role of dentists and technicians in the future how do you think dentists and technicians role will change with the new digital technologies? 19 the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. 2015: 201 cases the perception about the evolution of the role of dentists and technicians is changed in comparison to year its interesting to note a higher percentage of quotes related to the need for a tighter cooperation between dentists and technicians, and this statement is true especially for the respondents providing digital prostheses already. moreover, among digital technologies owners and scans users, there is a higher incidence of the statement the dentists will need to get more expertise. base: 282 cases (whole sample) mean 2018 2015 scenario: change in the way restorations are performed in your opinion, does the use of the digital technology change the type of restorations? 20 the 5 possible answers have been further clustered in order to better highlight the differences in the scores among the items. the clustering is the following: not related: the scores grouped in this cluster are not related, rather not related. neutral: the scores grouped in this cluster are neutral, rather related. fully related is shown without any grouping. 2015: 201 cases 2,8 2,8 2,5 2,4 base: 282 cases (whole sample) 158 cases change in the way restorations are performed change in the way restorations are performed the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. in comparison to year 2015, although the percentage of yes slightly decreases, all the different topics got a higher evaluation. when considering the difference versus the overall mean, its interesting to note that a higher gap is for the item materials used, while the positive gap of the item more fixed instead of removable restorations still is unchanged. -3% 5% scenario: required features from digital technology providers what should your digital technology provider offer you, to improve and enhance the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your practice? 21 base: 282 cases (whole sample) its interesting to evaluate the different perception among digital technologies users / non users, when considering the most required features from a digital technology provider. the digital technologies users mostly quoted a more convenient price and the need for training and information. on another hand, the non users are rather split between those being not interested and those asking for more training and information, much more than a convenient price. scenario: required features from digital technology providers what should your digital technology provider offer you, to improve and enhance the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your practice? 22 processing without don't know (235 cases) (150 cases) the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. in comparison to 2015, training and information shows a relevant increase: those items are felt to be more and more important and functional to an effective approach to the digital technologies. a convenient price still is important but to a lesser extent. the percentage of respondents who are not interested in this topic also increased. technologies for production of prosthesis with digital workflow in the practice digital technologies owners do you have the following equipment in your practice? 24 intra-oral scanner to take digital impressions chairside milling unit the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. (282 cases) (201 cases) (282 cases) (201 cases) the penetration of users for both intraoral scanners and chairside milling units is quite stable, as a slight increase can be noted for the intra oral scanners only. digital technologies: equipment numeric distribution - ranking 25 base: 23 cases (intra-oral scanner owners) base: 23 cases (digital technologies owners) intra-oral scanners to take digital impressions chairside milling units only base: 13 cases (chairside milling unit owners) chairside milling units including scanners due to the lower number of cases, the charts show the ranking of the mentioned brands, without indication of the percentage. what is the brand of your scanners/chairside milling units? overall digital technologies: cad-cam consumable materials - ranking what are the brands of the cad-cam consumable materials that you use with your chairside milling, at your practice? chairside milling unit owners 26 base: 13 cases (chairside milling unit owners) due to the lower number of cases, the charts show the ranking of the mentioned brands, without indication of the percentage. digital workflow in the practices digital technology use - breakdown by channel how do you provide digital restorations in your practice? 28 base: 123 cases (digital prosthesis providers) the following chart shows the penetration of the different channels calculated on the whole sample. the partner-lab is the most used channel, with a 41% of users. 5% of providers of digital restorations do have a chairside milling. also, its worth to note the increase in the use of the manufacturer /milling center (16% vs 12% in 2015). since practices may use different technologies and channels, the sum of percentages is higher than 100%. (282 cases) (201 cases) the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. percentage of surgeries - digital users only percentage of surgeries - whole sample (282 cases) (201 cases) digital technology use - breakdown by technology how do you provide digital restorations in your practice? 29 the following chart shows the penetration of the different technologies calculated on the whole sample. among digital technology users, the most used way to provide digital restorations is to send impressions in full outsourcing to partner-labs or manufacturers / milling centers, with a 41% of users, but a slight increase in the use of the scans can be noted (6% vs 4% in 2015). base: 123 cases (digital prosthesis providers) since practices may use different technologies and channels, the sum of percentages is higher than 100%. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. percentage of surgeries - digital users only percentage of surgeries - whole sample digital technology use - channels and technologies how do you provide digital restorations in your practice? 30 base: 123 cases (digital prosthesis providers) the chart allows to evaluate the percentage of users of different technologies, in comparison to the same technologies and the different channels used. please, see the example on the right. for example, among those performing full outsourcing, 38% of them send the impressions to a manufacturer and 97% of them send the impressions to a partner lab. for example, those sending their scans or models to a partner lab in 8% of the cases they also have a chairside milling unit and in 35% of the cases they also send the scans or impressions to a manufacturer/milling center. channels percentage of surgeries - digital users only digital technology use - technologies and channels how do you provide digital restorations in your practice? 31 base: 123 cases (digital prosthesis providers) the chart allows to evaluate the percentage of users of different technologies, in comparison to the same technologies and the different channels used. please, see the example on the right. for example, among those sending scans outside for milling, 44% of them also have a chairside milling unit and 83% are full outsourcing users. for example, those sending their impressions or scans to a partner lab, 16% of them have a scanner for sending scans outside and 8% of them also have a chairside milling unit. technologies percentage of surgeries - digital users only digital prosthesis production share considering all indirect restorations (crowns, bridges, inlays, onlays, veneers) produced with digital workflow at your practice, please tell us the percentage of them produced with the following techniques. 32 base: 123 cases (digital prosthesis providers) mean (digital prosthesis providers): 3,3 indirect restorations produced with digital workflow per week considering the digital prosthesis providers, 11% of the overall digital prosthesis production is produced with a chairside milling (about 5% in the whole market). by aggregating the information by channel we can say that among digital prosthesis providers, 79% of production is made by partner lab (which becomes 34% on the whole sample) and 10% by manufacturers (which becomes 4% on the whole sample). considering the technologies, 10% of the production is made by scans and 79% by impressions sent outside in full outsourcing mode. considering the whole market (including the non-providers of digital prosthesis), 4% of production is made of scans and 91% by traditional impressions. shares on total sample chairside milling: 5% scans sent outside: 4% traditional impressions: 91% 3d printing 3d printing awareness and use which statement regarding 3d printing in dentistry applies to you? 34 1% owners 99% non-owners despite quite some practices providing customized devices made up from 3d printers (as showed in the following slide), only 1% declare to own a 3d printer in the surgery. rather new but rapidly increasing, 3d printing looks to be well know as to be a digital technology available for dentistry as well: only a very small portion of the respondents declare not to be aware of it (4%). 3d printing seems to be more widely used among less young dentists and big sized surgeries. base: 282 cases (whole sample) 2015: 201 cases 3d printer users use of 3d printer to produce customized devices do you provide your patients with customized devices performed with 3d printing technologies, also in outsourcing? 35 base: 281 cases (whole sample) 3d printer users percentage of surgeries the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. 3d printer users (also in outsourcing) 1 practicing dentist (11%) dental technician in the practice (37%) digital prosthesis providers (45%) most suitable indications for 3d printing which of the following indications do you think that 3d printing will be best suitable for? 36 n/a n/a the comparison with 2015 results shows a relevant decrease for surgical guides for implant dentistry and fixed substructures. on the contrary, temporary crown and bridges, orthodontics, mobile dentures and impression trays has been quoted more frequently. in the previous edition, models and splints were not in the list of requested items. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. (202 cases) (152 cases) main consequences in dentistry brought by 3d printing to what extent do you agree on the following statements, with regard to the main consequences that 3d printing will bring to the dentistry? 37 mean by analysing the percentage of quotes of the positive scores (partially and fully agree) it is clear that two out of three are the most relevant items, explaining that the respondents expect an increase in the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow, and a wider range of materials available. trend analysis % of agree y. 2018 (agree) y. 2015 (yes) 80% 81% 80% 78% 41% 34% base: 282 cases (whole sample) brand awareness digital equipment brands: unaided awareness 39 thinking about the equipment to produce indirect restorations (crowns, bridges, inlays, onlays, veneers) with digital workflow, what brands come to your mind? the unaided awareness represents the entire group of brands of a certain product family, recalled by the interviewed sample. within the boundaries of spontaneous awareness, the consumer reasonably decides to make a purchase. dentsply sirona is the most mentioned brand, with a good increase with respect to year among the followers, 3shape and align technology are new entries, while 3m looses some points. ivoclar vivadent and straumann increase their performance as well.

overall brands the charts show the weight that the items evaluated have on the propensity to recommend a given brand, and on the right, their individual score. affordability, trust and reliability are the items showing the highest correlation with the recommendation. the analysis for dentsply sirona, highlights that innovation, reputation, trust and reliability are the items with the highest weight on recommendation. also affordability shows a higher than average importance in dentsply sirona recommendation model, but its score resulted to be below average, thus, it should be considered as a critical area of improvement. when considering the overall analysis, not to forget is the quite relevant importance of the item makes daily practice easier, whose score resulted to be below average. items importance average score 51 brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis map how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? overall brands the map is the visual result of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. on the horizontal axis there is the weight on the recommendation of each item, and on the vertical axis is the average score of each item. the items are arranged on the map in a way as that at the top right are the items that are very important to the recommendation and that received a high score. at the bottom right there are the items very relevant to the recommendation but with a lower than average score. this map shows the items evaluated in overall and serves as a reference for the comparison with the performance of each brand. (low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) strength points waste/inefficiency indifference critical area for improvement the overall analysis highlights that affordable and makes daily practice easier could be considered as strategic factors in the recommendation, because despite a higher than average weight on it, they resulted to perform lower than average. 52 brand positioning factor analysis brand positioning: factor analysis the factor analysis is a multi-variate statistical analysis used to investigate and give explanation of the correlations among a given number of variables. it relies on the concept that the correlations among the variables are not random, because they are due to some existing common factors. the aim is to identify and quantify the above said common factors. the factor analysis is a psychometric analysis, and it is used in the behavioural sciences, like social sciences, marketing, product management and other environments where a big amount of data is present. in this case, we have used the factor analysis to identify the main recommendation drivers for the main brands stated in the unaided awareness. the best results of the factor analysis have been achieved with 3 main factors: reputation customer orientation expensiveness factor 1 (reputation): this factor includes the items related to the image of the company, its ability to be a leading and highly reputable brand and its attitude towards innovation. factor 2 (customer orientation): this factor is made up of those items referring to a certain ability of the company to be customer oriented, not only in terms of customer service, but also with all those aspects regarding the ability to make the daily practice easier and its value for money. factor 3 (expensiveness): this factor is clearly related to the pricing policy and it shows a positive high correlation with the expensiveness, suggesting that a higher price could be a warranty of quality. 3 factors reputation customer orientation expensiveness leading company 0,893 worldwide reknown 0,853 highly reputable 0,782 innovative and at the forefront 0,688 trustworthy 0,625 good price quality ratio 0,813 makes daily practice easier 0,760 affordable 0,696 reliable 0,596 customer service oriented 0,551 too expensive 0,931 54 the displayed values represent the evaluation score of those factors, with a value ranging from -1 to +1 where 0 represents the overall mean value. for each investigated factor, the horizontal bars represent how much the performance differs from the overall mean (vertical axis). brand positioning: factor analysis - difference from mean + evaluation score dentsply sirona got a higher than average evaluation on reputation and the performance on the expensiveness factor is on par with the overall analysis. the other follower brands got a lower performance in terms of reputation. 55 brand positioning multiple regression analysis brand positioning : multiple regression analysis 39% 12% reputation expensiveness 49% customer orientation in order to complete the factor analysis, it is important to also assess the weight of these factors on the recommendation to understand if an improvement in one of them can also affect the way a particular brand is recommended. therefore, these factors are used as a basis for a further analysis, called multiple regression analysis that aims to understand how they explain the recommendation. the figure \"r2 = 0,645\" means that about 65% of the recommendation is explained and it is based on the given factors. the overall model shows that the weight of the customer orientation factor is about 49%, therefore the importance of this factor is relevant. the second most important factor is the reputation and expensiveness show the lowest weights. recommendation (r2=0,645) 57 brand positioning : multiple regression analysis the chart highlights the weight of the analyzed factors on the recommendation, for dentsply sirona and for the other brands in overall, with the aim to understand if an improvement in one of them can also affect the way a given brand is recommended. in comparison to the overall breakdown, dentsply sirona is characterized by a lower than the average weight of customer orientation and a higher weight of expensiveness. 58 intention to buy technology intention to buy: intraoral scanner are you willing to purchase an intra-oral scanner to take digital impressions within 2 years?

base: 588 cases (whole sample) 12 the segmentation by geographic areas shows a quite heterogeneous situation with respect to the perceived trend, although the positive perception of those located in the madrid center area, is more statistically significant. it also seems that younger technicians seem to be more optimistic. finally, the analysis reveals that the most recent and larger laboratories more frequently claim to have had an increase in their business. business trend of the laboratory - expectations about the next 12 months what trend do you think will be, in your laboratory, in the next 12 months? 13 base: 588 cases (whole sample) 13 with regard to the expected future trend, once again young technicians are more optimistic than average, and so is for the most recent and largest laboratories. analysis of confidence perception of current situation vs. perception of the future base: 588 cases (whole sample) perception of current situation perception about the future in this section, a confidence index is shown, based on the evaluation of the responses. the method consist of a comparison between the perception of the situation over the last 12 months versus the forecast for the future. the chart on the left shows that the majority of the respondents perceive a stable situation (38%). however, 41% of respondents perceived an increase in their business, while about 20% perceived a decrease. in the future trend forecast, the majority of the responses are neutral, in fact, 54% foresee an unchanged situation, while 38% of respondents think that the future business will increase, while 7% states there will be a decrease. 14 analysis of confidence perception of current situation vs. perception of future situation base: 588 cases (whole sample) the answers regarding the current and future trend of the practice certainly are affected by the psychological component. in order to objectively assess the level of confidence in the future, it may be useful to put in relation the 2 variables. in fact, the answer it will remain stable does have a negative value if the respondent perceived a reduction, while it becomes a positive answer when the respondent experienced a development of the business. in order to obtain an unbiased confidence index, we assume that when the current situation is considered negative, the confidence index will be considered positive only when a consistent increase is the forecast for the future. vice versa, if theres a current positive situation, a stable forecast will be considered a positive forecast too. the model highlights a generalized optimism. 66% of the respondents shows a positive confidence index, 22% is neutral and 12% show a negative index. thus, the global index is positive (54%). 15 it will decrease a lot it will decrease slightly it will remain stable it will increase slightly it will increase a lot increased a lot 0,0% 0,1% 1,3% 2,6% 0,8% 33% 66% increased slightly 0,0% 0,2% 13,6% 22,7% 3,9% 33% stable 0,0% 0,7% 17,6% 18,6% 1,6% 22% 54% decreased slightly 0,1% 0,8% 8,5% 4,6% 0,8% 9% decreased a lot 0,3% 0,2% 1,1% 0,0% 0,0% 2% 12% future situation current situation analysis of confidence perception of current situation vs. perception of future situation base: 588 cases (whole sample) thanks to the cooperation with a psychologist expert in behavioral techniques and market dynamics, a socio-psychologic interpretation has been given to each cluster. therefore, the following interpretations can be presented.",

base: 588 cases (whole sample) 22 percentage of laboratories 69% of the respondents declare to provide their clients with fixed prosthetics elements produced with digital technologies. when analyzing the evolution of the digital process, it emerges an increase that mainly affects the largest laboratories with a higher number of served practices. the use of digital technologies also is higher in the northeast and barcelona area (84%) and in the labs ran by younger owners (85%). it is also significant that the percentage increases (89%) among those declaring a very positive expected future trend and among those more inclined to use management technologies (79%) and the digital cloud (83%). cad-cam users 1 technician (45%) 3 or more technicians (83%) served practices <=5 (53%) served practices >10 (80%) the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. digital prosthesis provider 2015: 77 cases digital prosthesis provider role of digital technologies on prosthetics in the future how do you feel the new digital technologies (cad-cam and 3d printing) will affect the way the prosthetics is carried out in your country? base: 588 cases (whole sample) in comparison to the past edition, the percentage of users stating that digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics increased slightly. by deepening the analysis by segments, a significant difference emerges, between digital technologies users and providers of traditional prosthetics. besides this, its interesting to note the high percentage (63%), among the users of partner-lab channel for the production of digital prosthetic elements, for the statement digital technologies will replace most of the traditional prosthetics. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. 23 2015: 77 cases 2015: 75 cases stance versus digital technologies what is your stance versus the digital technologies? base: 588 cases (whole sample) the situation changed a lot in comparison to 2015: the confidence in digital technologies increased considerably. it is more evident the difference in the stance versus digital technologies between those using it already and feeling comfortable. the difference is more evident when considering the comparison between full outsourcing digital prosthesis providers and the other digital prosthesis providers. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. 24 role of dentists and technicians in the future how do you think dentists and technicians role will change with the new digital technologies? base: 588 cases (whole sample) the perception about the evolution of the role of dentists and technicians changed as well, in comparison to year its interesting to note a higher percentage of quotes related to the need of cooperation between dentists and technicians, and this statement is true especially for the respondents providing digital prostheses already. among full outsourcing users, the percentage of those stating that there will be no change is remarkably higher. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. 25 2015: 76 cases required features from digital technology providers what should your digital technology provider offer you, to improve and enhance the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your laboratory? in comparison to 2015, training and information shows a relevant increase: those items are felt to be more and more important and functional to an effective approach to the digital technologies. a convenient price still is important but to a lesser extent. also, an increased performance gains importance with respect to the past. 26 588 cases 68 cases 3d printing awareness and use which statement regarding 3d printing in dentistry applies to your laboratory? base: 588 cases (whole sample) 14% of users / ex-users 86% of non-users 27 rather new but rapidly increasing, 3d printing looks to be well know as to be a digital technology available for dentistry as well: only a very small portion of the respondents declare not to be aware of it (12%). 3d printing seems to be more widely used among younger technicians and big sized labs. most suitable indications for 3d printing which of the following indications do you think that 3d printing will be best suitable for? base: 441 cases (aware of 3d printing and ex-users) base: 79 cases (3d printing users) for which of the following indications do you use your 3d printer? 28 while the indication for models is the first mentioned one for both users and non-users, its interesting to notice that non-users believe a high use is for surgical guides for implant dentistry (47%), while the users show a much lower use for this indication (26%). also, the current use for temporary crowns & bridges is far lower than predicted by non users (50% non users vs 38% users). most suitable indications for 3d printing overall: 3d printing users vs. aware of 3d printing and ex-users base: 520 cases (aware of 3d printing, ex-users and users) 29 the comparison with 2015 results shows a relevant decrease for temporary crown and bridges, surgical guides for implant dentistry, permanent crowns & bridges and fixed substructures. this phenomenon could be affected by the higher overlap of answers of 2015 (models and splits excluded, since these items were not available in the 2015 list). 77 cases 520 cases 3d printing unit: numeric distribution what is the brand of your 3d printing unit? base: 73 cases (3d printing users) 30 the numeric distribution related to the use of 3d printers shows a relevant share for the brand formlabs, which is the leader by a wide margin, followed by 3d system. main consequences in dentistry brought by 3d printing to what extent do you agree on the following statements, with regard to the main consequences that 3d printing will bring to the dentistry? please rate them with fully agree, partially agree, neutral, partially disagree, fully disagree. base: 588 cases (whole sample) by analysing the percentage of quotes of the positive scores (partially and fully agree) it is clear that two out of three are the most relevant items, explaining that the respondents expect an increase in the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow, and a wider range of materials available. mean trend analysis % of agree 31 y. 2018 (agree) y. 2015 (yes) 72% 82% 68% 70% 39% 34% preference about courses to enhance digital knowledge would you rather attend a course to enhance your digital knowledge preferably at your dealer or manufacturer? base: 588 cases (whole sample) 32 almost a half of the interviewees have no preference whether it would be better to attend a course either at the dealer or at the manufacturer. even it doesnt emerge a clear the preference, a slightly higher percentage of respondents would like to attend a course preferably at the manufacturer. less young respondents and smaller sized laboratories show a lower interest towards this topic, while bigger sized laboratories state a higher interest in attending courses, with a higher than average preference for the manufacturer. customized digital cad-design do you / your team take care of digital cad-design or is it a task you leave to the partner laboratory/milling center?

overall brands 53 the charts show the weight that the items evaluated have on the propensity to recommend a given brand, and on the right, their individual score. trust, reliability, and customer orientation are the items showing the highest correlation with the recommendation. regarding the items related to the pricing, it seems like if a brand is affordable, this characteristic has a remarkable impact on the recommendation, but when the price rises, it loses its impact and other items affect more the propensity to recommend a brand. items importance average score brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis map 54 how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? overall brands the map is the visual result of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. on the horizontal axis there is the weight on the recommendation of each item, and on the vertical axis is the average score of each item. the items are arranged on the map in a way as that at the top right are the items that are very important to the recommendation and that received a high score. at the bottom right there are the items very relevant to the recommendation but with a lower than average score. this map shows the items evaluated in overall and serves as a reference for the comparison with the performance of each brand. (low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) prerequisites waste/inefficiency indifference key success factors its interesting to note that customer service oriented and affordable are important items in the definition of the recommendation, but they received lower than average scores, and they are positioned in the key success factors. brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis 55 items importance average score how much are worth the single items on the recommendation?

dentsply sirona 61 items importance average score its interesting to note that in dentsply sirona correlation analysis model, a good price quality ratio belongs to the most relevant items in the definition of the recommendation. the fact that even the item affordable is present among the most important ones, leave room to think that the price factor becomes important, in the brand perception of dentsply sirona, for the definition of the recommendation. not significant brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis map how much are worth the single items on the recommendation?

technologies base: 405 cases (digital restorations providers) 66 percentage of laboratories among digital technology users, the most used technology is scanner and the most used way to provide digital restorations is to send scans to a manufacturer or milling center. 63% is the percent of scanner owners, out of the total digital restorations providers, who use the scanner to send the files outside for milling. in comparison to year 2015, scanner owners increased remarkably, along with milling center owners. on the other hand, the percentage of full outsourcing providers showed a relevant decrease. since laboratories may use different technologies and channels, the sum of percentages is higher than 100%. digital technology use: breakdown by technology taking into considerations all the elements made with cad-cam systems, what percentage do you use the following supply channels? channels 67 base: 405 cases (digital restorations providers) the manufacturer/milling center is the most used channel, with a 70% of users. percentage of laboratories in comparison to year 2015, there have been a relevant decrease of laboratories being supplied by partner labs, while the use of the manufacturer channel increased remarkably. since laboratories may use different technologies and channels, the sum of percentages is higher than 100%. digital technology use: breakdown by technology taking into considerations all the elements made with cad-cam systems, what percentage do you use the following technologies or supply channels? technologies and channels 68 percentage of laboratories base: 405 cases (digital restorations providers) for example, among those using a scanner, 35% of them also have an in-houose milling and 25% are full outsourcing users. for example, those sending their models or scans to a partner lab, 69% of them have a scanner for sending scans outside and 29% of them also have an in-house milling. the chart allows to evaluate the percentage of users of different technologies, in comparison with the same technologies and the different channels used. please, see the example on the right. digital technology use: breakdown by technology taking into considerations all the elements made with cad-cam systems, what percentage do you use the following technologies or supply channels?

total scanners (330 cases) scans sent outside (242 cases) the numeric distribution is the percentage of clients that mentioned to use a certain brand, or to get delivered by a certain supplier. thats why it is comparable with the coverage index, it is a subjective value, related to the brand or supplier which is named by the clients as their brand or their supplier. open technologies have certainly increased their presence among the spanish dental labs, and dentsply sirona improved its position too. 71 in-house milling units: numeric distribution what is the brand of your milling unit? base: 139 cases (milling units owners) 72 the numeric distribution is the percentage of clients that mentioned to use a certain brand, or to get delivered by a certain supplier. thats why it is comparable with the coverage index, it is a subjective value, related to the brand or supplier which is named by the clients as their brand or their supplier. as for the milling units, vhf and amann girrbach have increased their performance over the last years. manufacturer milling centers: numeric distribution considering the scans and the models sent to manufacturers / milling centers, what is the name of those manufacturers / milling centers? base: 205 cases (manufacturer users) 73 the numeric distribution is the percentage of clients that mentioned to use a certain brand, or to get delivered by a certain supplier. thats why it is comparable with the coverage index, it is a subjective value, related to the brand or supplier which is named by the clients as their brand or their supplier. as regards the scans/models sent outside for milling, when comparing the results with the 2015 edition, it is interesting to note the spreading of specialized milling centers, such as ideas medical solution, while sineldent confirms its leading position among the centralized milling centers in spain. cad-cam frames materials: numeric distribution q: what are the brands of the cad-cam materials (blocks or discs) that you use with your milling unit, at your laboratory?

base: 84 cases (in-house and partner lab users) 74 processing without dont know / no answer the numeric distribution is the percentage of clients that mentioned to use a certain brand, or to get delivered by a certain supplier. thats why it is comparable with the coverage index, it is a subjective value, related to the brand or supplier which is named by the clients as their brand or their supplier. technology intention to buy are you planning to start providing fixed prosthesis elements produced with digital technologies (cad-cam / 3d printing) within the next year? 75 18% of those not performing fixed prosthetics using digital technologies plan to start within a year. this percentage increases among laboratories with three or more technicians (31%) and among those declaring a positive perception with respect to the future of their business (27%). if, on one hand, the intention to buy have increased remarkably in recent years - in 2012 only 7% of those not providing digitally produced prosthesis declared they would have done - with the wide spreading of the digital technology, still there seem to be a hard socket of those somehow adverse to it, as the very slight change from 2015 (16%) to 2018 (18%) demonstrates. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. base: 159 cases (not providing digital restorations) 2015: 25 cases intention to buy intention to buy technology intention to buy: why not are you planning to start providing fixed prosthesis elements produced with digital technologies (cad-cam / 3d printing) within the next year? if not, why? 76 base: 131 cases (not willing to provide digital restorations) the most relevant reasons still are related to a low demand for this kind of technology / no need, or because it requires what is considered to be a too high investment. intention to buy 2015 customer experience and loyalty metrics overall satisfaction the overall experience with a company and the extent to which their needs are met. perceived value the utility and benefit of a product relative to the cost paid for that product. advocacy a users willingness to recommend a company to colleagues is a key driver of revenue and profit growth in most industries. repurchase intention the likelihood a user will continue to use a companys products in the near future. net promoter score respondents are categorized as either advocates, neutrals, or detractors of each brand. for each brand overall, the nps subtracts the percent share of detractors from the percent share of advocates, to show net impact on word-of- mouth referrals. loyalty metrics overall satisfaction loyalty metrics perceived value likelihood to recommend repurchase intention detractors neutrals advocates brand advocacy score 78 satisfaction score: overall brands lets consider now each one of the used cad-cam brands, please rate your satisfaction concerning the following factors.

the bottom right there are the items that are very correlated to the overall satisfaction, but with lower than average satisfaction scores. the start-up training, as seen in the overall analysis map, seems to be important in the construction of the satisfaction among open technologies users, while its satisfaction score looks to be very low indeed. overall satisfaction: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the overall satisfaction? amann girrbach 93 items importance satisfaction score opposite to the overall results, the most relevant items in the construction of amann girrbach satisfaction seems to be related to the company availability and flexibility and to the technical assistance and support areas, in addition to the overall running costs and the software

than average weight in the construction of the overall satisfaction do show a lower than average satisfaction score. overall satisfaction: correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the overall satisfaction? 3shape 95 items importance satisfaction score 3shape correlation analysis shows a quite different situation in comparison to the overall brands. the most important items for the construction of the satisfaction are company availability and flexibility, frequency of sw updates and start-up training. not significant overall satisfaction: correlation analysis map how much

than average satisfied. at the bottom right there are the items that are very correlated to the overall satisfaction, but with lower than average satisfaction scores. as seen in the map of amann girrbach, a lot of items are placed in the critical area for improvement of 3shape map. among them, start up training, frequency of sw updates and overall running costs are those with the highest weight on the overall satisfaction. overall satisfaction factor analysis customer satisfaction: factor analysis the reduction into factors allowed us to obtain 3 main factors performance support operating costs factor 1 (performance) it is about everything related to the performance of the equipment, not only in terms of accuracy, quality and reliability, but also in terms of letting the laboratory perform at its best, having an easier daily practice and an increased productivity. other relevant items featuring this factor are related to a wide range of procedures and materials available. factor 2 (support) it is interesting to note that among the items included in this factor, there is business development support, which is not very closely related to the technical area, whose items are indeed part of this factor, but is felt to be important in the support provided by the brands, especially regarding this kind of equipment. factor 3 (operating costs) the third factor actually is related to the impact that the operating costs of such kind of equipment may have in the daily practice, especially when, sometimes, the software updates come at a certain price level. 98 3 factors performance support operating costs accuracy and overall quality of the restorations 0,831 makes daily practice easier 0,819 productivity increase 0,814 reliability 0,813 wide range of procedures available 0,798 handiness / ease of use 0,769 wide range of materials available 0,728 compatibility with other brands 0,681 start-up training 0,580 company availability and flexibility 0,560 technical assistance in case of repair 0,834 technical support from the company 0,779 business development support 0,549 cost of sw updates 0,861 overall running costs 0,625 + satisfaction level customer satisfaction: factor analysis - difference from mean level of satisfaction by brand on the factors resulting from the factor analysis. the displayed values represent the satisfaction level of those factors, with a value ranging from -1 to +1 where 0 represents the overall mean value. for each investigated factor, the horizontal bars represent how much the satisfaction performance differs from the overall mean (vertical axis). the significant differences from the mean are marked with a red circle, so that it is possible to focus on the most interesting topics. with this regard, it is worth to note the higher than average performance of amann girrbach and 3shape regarding the factor performance, while it is significant the below average performance of 3shape in the factor operating costs. 99 overall satisfaction multiple regression analysis customer satisfaction: multiple regression analysis 101 in order to complete the factor analysis, it is important to also assess the weight of these factors on the overall satisfaction to understand if an improvement in one of them can also improve the satisfaction of a particular brand. therefore, these factors are used as a basis for a further analysis, called multiple regression analysis that aims to understand how they explain the overall satisfaction. the figure \"r2 = 0,878\" means that more than 80% of the total satisfaction is explained and it is based on the given factors, which is a remarkable result. the overall model shows that the weight of the performance factor is slightly less than 50%, therefore the importance of this factor is relevant. the second factor is the support, then operating costs shows the lowest weight. it is interesting to look at the following slides, when the same analysis is carried out on the single brands. overall satisfaction (r2=0,878) 46% 25% performance operating costs 29% support customer satisfaction: multiple regression analysis 102 apart from open technologies, showing a relevant weight for the factor performance, it looks like the regression models of the other investigated brands is predominantly driven by the operating costs, meaning that this factor highly affects the overall satisfaction of amann girrbach and 3shape, while for open technologies it has a marginal weight. as a matter of fact, for amman girrbach and 3shape, the items included in this factor emerged as key items to improve the overall satisfaction in the correlation analysis and the factor analysis highlighted the need to improve this topic. especially in the case of 3shape, looking back at its satisfaction scores in the factor analysis, it now looks more important strategically the weaker performance on the operating costs factor, more than the strong results on the performance factor.
