These reasons are represented by horizontal bars, where the length of each bar corresponds to the percentage of respondents who have cited that specific reason.\n\nBelow is the detailed explanation based on the chart:\n\n**Reasons for Not Using Digital Technology Within 2 Years:**\n\n1. **I don't need it**: With a substantial percentage of 51%, this is the most commonly stated reason cited by respondents. It reflects that they see no immediate necessity for adopting digital technologies.\n\n2. **I prefer the traditional method**: This reason is selected by 19% of people, indicating that for these individuals, the traditional methods are more comfortable or perceived as more effective than digital alternatives.\n\n3. **Too expensive**: Seventeen percent of respondents are influenced by the high costs associated with digital technology, which can be a significant barrier, especially for smaller businesses or individuals who might not have the budget.\n\n4. **Low demand**: Representing 13% of the responses, the observation that there is a low demand for the technology means respondents feel there is minimal or no need to invest in digital solutions.\n\n5. **Poor system precision**: This reason is selected by 2% of the respondents. They concern themselves with issues of precision in the current digital setup, preferring improvements before adoption.\n\n6. **Poor familiarity with technologies**: It is selected by just 1% of the respondents, which indicates that it\u2019s a minor factor and implies existing skill sets or comfort levels with digital tools.\n\n7. **I have other priority**: Only 0% of respondents cited this reason, suggesting that in this context, digital technology is not competing with other high-priority efforts.\n\n8. **Other**: A minor category with 2% of respondents, indicating other less common reasons not explicitly listed on the chart.\n\n9. **Don\u2019t know**: Similarly, a non-factor with a negligible 0%, which suggests respondents were certain in their decision-making process regarding the adoption of digital technology.\n\n**Additional Context from the First Image:**\n\nAt the top of the page, the first main image provides graphical support with a pie chart breaking down the reasons for not wanting to start using digital technology. A large majority of respondents, about 82%, are in favor of not employing digital technology (labelled as \"No\"). Of the remaining 18%, 6% are willing to use digital technology but unsure, and only 12% show a willingness to start within two years.\n\nThe descriptive text from the first main image underscores that the \"most important quotes\" by respondents revolve around the lack of need and preference for traditional methods. This is corroborated by the chart in the bottom section, emphasizing points about traditional methods being satisfactory and priced reasonably, which together are perceived as beneficial barriers rather than hindrances by most respondents.\n\n**Summary and Integration:**\n\nThe primary visual message of the image is that a substantial majority, almost two-thirds of the respondents, have no immediate interest in adopting digital technology over the next two years. There is a clear dominating perspective that traditional methods are adequate and often more cost-effective, reinforcing why there is minimal interest in transitioning to digital setups amid existing needs and existing comfortable systems. This perspective is further reinforced by the pie chart supporting the broader data, reflecting a dominant but scattered group of people willing to adopt digital technology within two years."}, {"file": "OMNI_DIGITAL_EU_15_LAB", "page": 59, "image_description": "The image contains a pie chart in the design of a larger infographic.

The importance and media scores highlight how customer-oriented services (0.755) and globally recognized brands (0.667) are significant but not as high as the leading company (0.753), which scores 4.1. This indicates a higher market impact and customer trust associated with a leading company or brand. \n\nThe data emphasizes the need for a multifaceted approach in recommending products or services, where leading companies are perceived as superior both in importance and media impact. Other factors such as service quality (0.345) and perceived cost (3.8) significantly affect customer decisions yet are not as dominant. In contrast, the item \"Demonstratively costly\" (0.0) highlights that being expensive does not translate into a positive recommendation unless effectively marketed or justified. \n\nThis detailed examination supports understanding how various components contribute differently to consumer perception and decision-making processes."}, {"file": "OMNI_DIGITAL_SPA_19_CLI_LAB_INTEGRATED_spagnolo", "page": 148, "image_description": "The image contains a matrix titled \"De gran reputaci\u00f3n\" which translates to \"With great reputation.\" The matrix is designed to showcase how different factors contribute to a high level of reputation.

It references past trends and observed phenomena regarding the proportion of dental technicians in dental practices across various countries. For instance, it notes that Germany is among the top countries where dental technicians are more prevalent within dental practices. Additionally, it suggests a correlation between the size of dental offices and the presence of dental technicians.\n\n#### Data Representation:\n1. **France**:\n   - Over 98% represents the percentage of dental practitioners who indicated that they indeed have at least one dental technician employed internally. This is visually illustrated as a nearly black bar stretching almost completely across, with minimal white space to denote the 2% discrepancy. This suggests a high reliance on dental technicians in French dental practices, leaving little leftover data.\n\n2. **Germany**:\n   - 78% of the respondents identified having one or more dental technicians on staff. The bar for Germany is much narrower than France's, displaying a segmented blue area of 22%, which indicates a significant portion but considerably lower compared to France.\n\n3. **Italy**:\n   - Italy shows a figure of 91% employment of dental technicians within practices, visually seen as a darker bar with the 9% segment marked in white, signifying minimal external or untrained personnel.\n\n4. **Spain**:\n   - For Spain, the data indicates 86% of dental practices utilize dental technicians. The section marked in blue indicates the remaining 14% for non-technician staff.\n\n5. **UK**:\n   - In the UK, 97% of dental practitioners confirm the presence of dental technicians within their practices. Similar to Germany, the chart displays this in a dark-blue, nearly full bar with a white-highlighted segment of 3%, illustrating minimal external personnel.\n\n### Additional Observations:\nThe structure of the graph uses differentiated colors and shading to differentiate between the majority (larger percentage) and minority (smaller percentage) of practices with or without dental technician staff. The contrast between the dominant dark tones and the accentuating highlights effectively emphasizes the data discrepancies and provides a visual aid to the surveyed statistic. \n\nThis detailed description, based on the information provided in the second part of the first image, highlights how dental technicians are integral to various European dental practice setups and points towards high reliance in countries like Germany and France, with varying but notable proportions in other countries."}, {"file": "BEQ_2301_OVERALL_multi", "page": 14, "image_description": "The image contains a detailed bar graph comparing the awareness levels of various dental product brands.

Examples include \"I feel this company to be among the most familiar and friendly one,\" \"I feel this company to be among the most customer-oriented ones,\" \"this company supports my business development more than others,\" and \"the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio.\" These attributes are seen to generally contribute positively but might not be as decisive or universally appealing.\n\n- **Bottom Right Quadrant (High quality/price ratio, Negative recommendation)**:\n  - Moving to the bottom right, these attributes contribute notably to the quality/price ratio but might have negative underlying impressions. These traits are less prevalent in this heat map suggesting they may impact the perception negatively.\n\n- **Non-selected Cells (Negative, High to Neutral recommendations)**:\n  - Some cells, not entirely highlighted (possibly lower correlation) in red, showcase various attributes such as perceived support and perceived ease-of-use. They might be important to some but contribute less to overall positive brand perception.\n\nThe heatmap suggests how a range of attributes interact to influence consumer perceptions and recommendations.
