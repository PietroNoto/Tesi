overall brands the charts show the weight that the items evaluated have on the propensity to recommend a given brand, and on the right, their individual score. affordability, trust and reliability are the items showing the highest correlation with the recommendation. the analysis for dentsply sirona, highlights that innovation, reputation, trust and reliability are the items with the highest weight on recommendation. also affordability shows a higher than average importance in dentsply sirona recommendation model, but its score resulted to be below average, thus, it should be considered as a critical area of improvement. when considering the overall analysis, not to forget is the quite relevant importance of the item makes daily practice easier, whose score resulted to be below average. items importance average score 51 brand image vs. recommendation: correlation analysis map how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? overall brands the map is the visual result of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. on the horizontal axis there is the weight on the recommendation of each item, and on the vertical axis is the average score of each item. the items are arranged on the map in a way as that at the top right are the items that are very important to the recommendation and that received a high score. at the bottom right there are the items very relevant to the recommendation but with a lower than average score. this map shows the items evaluated in overall and serves as a reference for the comparison with the performance of each brand. (low) weight on recommendation (high) (low) items score (high) strength points waste/inefficiency indifference critical area for improvement the overall analysis highlights that affordable and makes daily practice easier could be considered as strategic factors in the recommendation, because despite a higher than average weight on it, they resulted to perform lower than average. 52 brand positioning factor analysis brand positioning: factor analysis the factor analysis is a multi-variate statistical analysis used to investigate and give explanation of the correlations among a given number of variables. it relies on the concept that the correlations among the variables are not random, because they are due to some existing common factors. the aim is to identify and quantify the above said common factors. the factor analysis is a psychometric analysis, and it is used in the behavioural sciences, like social sciences, marketing, product management and other environments where a big amount of data is present. in this case, we have used the factor analysis to identify the main recommendation drivers for the main brands stated in the unaided awareness. the best results of the factor analysis have been achieved with 3 main factors: reputation customer orientation expensiveness factor 1 (reputation): this factor includes the items related to the image of the company, its ability to be a leading and highly reputable brand and its attitude towards innovation. factor 2 (customer orientation): this factor is made up of those items referring to a certain ability of the company to be customer oriented, not only in terms of customer service, but also with all those aspects regarding the ability to make the daily practice easier and its value for money. factor 3 (expensiveness): this factor is clearly related to the pricing policy and it shows a positive high correlation with the expensiveness, suggesting that a higher price could be a warranty of quality. 3 factors reputation customer orientation expensiveness leading company 0,893 worldwide reknown 0,853 highly reputable 0,782 innovative and at the forefront 0,688 trustworthy 0,625 good price quality ratio 0,813 makes daily practice easier 0,760 affordable 0,696 reliable 0,596 customer service oriented 0,551 too expensive 0,931 54 the displayed values represent the evaluation score of those factors, with a value ranging from -1 to +1 where 0 represents the overall mean value. for each investigated factor, the horizontal bars represent how much the performance differs from the overall mean (vertical axis). brand positioning: factor analysis - difference from mean + evaluation score dentsply sirona got a higher than average evaluation on reputation and the performance on the expensiveness factor is on par with the overall analysis. the other follower brands got a lower performance in terms of reputation. 55 brand positioning multiple regression analysis brand positioning : multiple regression analysis 39% 12% reputation expensiveness 49% customer orientation in order to complete the factor analysis, it is important to also assess the weight of these factors on the recommendation to understand if an improvement in one of them can also affect the way a particular brand is recommended. therefore, these factors are used as a basis for a further analysis, called multiple regression analysis that aims to understand how they explain the recommendation. the figure \"r2 = 0,645\" means that about 65% of the recommendation is explained and it is based on the given factors. the overall model shows that the weight of the customer orientation factor is about 49%, therefore the importance of this factor is relevant. the second most important factor is the reputation and expensiveness show the lowest weights. recommendation (r2=0,645) 57 brand positioning : multiple regression analysis the chart highlights the weight of the analyzed factors on the recommendation, for dentsply sirona and for the other brands in overall, with the aim to understand if an improvement in one of them can also affect the way a given brand is recommended. in comparison to the overall breakdown, dentsply sirona is characterized by a lower than the average weight of customer orientation and a higher weight of expensiveness. 58 intention to buy technology intention to buy: intraoral scanner are you willing to purchase an intra-oral scanner to take digital impressions within 2 years?

14 base: 722 cases there is a relevant difference between dentists and technicians, as the former mostly think that its necessary to get closer to digital technologies because they are the future, while the latter clearly state to be comfortable in using it. much lower the percentage of those feeling uncomfortable with digital technologies. germany stands out with its positive stance versus the digital technologies. the majority of french respondents is getting closer to the digital technologies, typical of the development phase of a new market. it looks like an area of resistance is present, made up of those using the digital technologies because they need, but feeling uncomfortable about that. it is the minority, but it must be added to the more relevant share of those clearly feeling uncomfortable with digital technologies. scenario: stance versus digital technologies what is your stance versus the digital technologies? 15 base: 722 cases among laboratories is more evident the difference in the stance versus digital technologies, between those using it already and the rest of the sample, not providing digital technologies at all. the difference is more evident when considering the comparison between full outsourcing users and other digital restorations providers. scenario: role of dentists and technicians in the future how do you think dentists and technicians role will change with the new digital technologies? 16 base: 722 cases in overall, the majority of respondents think that - as it happens among dentists - that the cooperation will get tighter, due to the expertise of the technicians. slightly higher than the sample of dental practices is the percentage of respondents stating there will not be any change at all: the higher one is from spain, italy and france. again, the stance of german respondents is quite different from the other countries, where a higher share of respondents believe that the dentists will need to get more expert about prosthetics. scenario: role of dentists and technicians in the future how do you think dentists and technicians role will change with the new digital technologies?

ranging from -1 to +1 where 0 represents the overall mean value. for each investigated factor, the horizontal bars represent how much the satisfaction performance differs from the overall mean (vertical axis). the significant differences from the mean are marked with a red circle, so that it is possible to focus on the most interesting topics. with this regard, it is worth to note the higher than average performance of amann girrbach and 3shape regarding the factor performance, while it is significant the below average performance of 3shape in the factor operating costs. 99 overall satisfaction multiple regression analysis customer satisfaction: multiple regression analysis 101 in order to complete the factor analysis, it is important to also assess the weight of these factors on the overall satisfaction to understand if an improvement in one of them can also improve the satisfaction of a particular brand. therefore, these factors are used as a basis for a further analysis, called multiple regression analysis that aims to understand how they explain the overall satisfaction. the figure \"r2 = 0,878\" means that more than 80% of the total satisfaction is explained and it is based on the given factors, which is a remarkable result. the overall model shows that the weight of the performance factor is slightly less than 50%, therefore the importance of this factor is relevant. the second factor is the support, then operating costs shows the lowest weight. it is interesting to look at the following slides, when the same analysis is carried out on the single brands. overall satisfaction (r2=0,878) 46% 25% performance operating costs 29% support customer satisfaction: multiple regression analysis 102 apart from open technologies, showing a relevant weight for the factor performance, it looks like the regression models of the other investigated brands is predominantly driven by the operating costs, meaning that this factor highly affects the overall satisfaction of amann girrbach and 3shape, while for open technologies it has a marginal weight. as a matter of fact, for amman girrbach and 3shape, the items included in this factor emerged as key items to improve the overall satisfaction in the correlation analysis and the factor analysis highlighted the need to improve this topic. especially in the case of 3shape, looking back at its satisfaction scores in the factor analysis, it now looks more important strategically the weaker performance on the operating costs factor, more than the strong results on the performance factor.

point of view with which they are considered: the satisfaction related to the whole market or the satisfaction related to a single product/brand. satisfaction related to a specific company/product here the scheme is the same, but we can highlight the strength points in the upper-right side of the map, which can determine inefficiency or low differentiation if placed in the left side of the map. in the lower-right we can note an improvement area, where we can find the weak points of a certain company. satisfaction related to the whole market here we can highlight some prerequisites (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors satisfy the market), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, where companies are not always able to satisfy customers with regard to strategic issues), and indifference areas (lower-left side of the map) which become waste/not efficient areas when a company decides to invest in those items belonging to the upper-left side of the map since, they tends to satisfy the market but they actually dont affect the overall satisfaction at all. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis how much are worth the single items on the overall satisfaction? 82 items satisfaction score items weight on overall satisfaction when assessing the weight of the different items on the overall satisfaction, the business support was found to be not very relevant and we decided to exclude it from the subsequent factor analysis. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis overall 83 (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) (low) satisfaction score (high) it is very interesting to see how the key components, being crucial in the determination of the overall satisfaction, all belong to service items and a crucial role is played by the running costs of the digital technologies, not properly related to the purchasing price. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis sirona 84 (low) satisfaction score (high) (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) sirona brand has a relevant role, as it is by far the most quoted brand and to a certain extent affects the overall analysis, most of all in the customer satisfaction. that is no surprise that several main components seen in the overall results are also present in this map. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis kavo 85 (low) satisfaction score (high) (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) kavo users feel the overall running costs not to be a crucial topic, but they are looking at softer items, like assistance and flexibility of the brand. customer satisfaction - correlation analysis 3m 86 (low) satisfaction score (high) (low) weight on overall satisfaction (high) among the most crucial items there are the overall running costs and the technical assistance. the handiness and ease of use are also crucial items. customer satisfaction: factor analysis 87 the reduction into factors allowed us to obtain 4 main drivers, product and service quality, easy practice, management costs, compatibility. factor 1 (product and service quality) it is related to the intrinsic qualities of the product, (which in this case is very different from the usual analysis on consumable products) and to services strictly related to it. seldom is possible to see an item in the factor analysis which carries together items related to the product component and to the service as well. in this case, the technical assistance and the sw updates go hand in hand with the accuracy and the ease of use. factor 2 (easy practice) the second factor has some soft components related to the grade of availability the company has to make the daily practice easy in the use of the digital technologies. this is true, according to the results of this analysis, when a company gives support in starting up the digital business, when the company is available and flexible and a wide range of materials is available. all of that, makes a company look reliable as well. 4 factors product and service quality easy practice management costs compatibility technical support from the company 0,844 technical assistance in case of repair 0,810 accuracy and overall quality of the restorations 0,779 handiness / ease of use 0,778 frequency of sw updates from the company 0,729 start-up training 0,800 wide range of materials available 0,774 availability and flexibility of the company 0,672 reliability 0,552 cost of sw updates 0,822 overall running costs 0,605 compatibility with other brands 0,907 factor 3 (management costs) not to forget that the new digital technologies can be considered a business of the practice, so that the management costs are also important to make this business profitable for the practice. in this sense, the running costs and the cost for sw updates make a separate factor accounting for the overall satisfaction. this factor has not to be confused with the cost for acquiring a digital equipment, but clearly, the ordinary costs, sustained every year to run the digital business do have their own importance. factor 4 (compatibility) the fourth and last factor is strictly related to the compatibility of the system with other systems, which allows for a easy way to expand the business and meet the needs from the patients. an open systems surely helps the users to be more flexible and ready to face the different situations that digital restorations shows. customer satisfaction: multiple regression analysis 88 what seen in the factor analysis takes here an assessment with regard to the importance that the multiple regression analysis highlights the single factors may have in determining the overall satisfaction. the value of r2 is really high in this analysis (0,832), so that we are pretty sure that almost all satisfaction can be explained by the items contained in the factors here shown. the item with the most relevant importance looks to be product and service quality accounting for 43% of the total satisfaction. it is quite obvious to see this, as the list of items contained in this item are very important features (just like said before, they are related to both the product and the service), and the overall satisfaction cannot be considered regardless those items and, consequently, this factor. what strikes the attention the most is the third item management costs, which accounts for 26% and it is the second most important factor in the assessment of the overall satisfaction. it is clear how issues like cost of sw updates and more generally running costs are considered to be quite important. not far from the management costs factor, the third most important one is easy practice accounting for 21% of the overall satisfaction. the way a company helps professionals to get the digital business started in a easy and quick way, accounts for a relevant portion in assessing the overall satisfaction.

in the clinical sample (the relationship with the industry will become tighter) unlike it happened with the dentists sample, the second most quoted answer is that the relationship with the technicians will become blander, due to the fact that dentists are not required to get specific expertise about cad processing. this clearly is the technicians point of view, perhaps, this is affected by the worries that the chairside cad-cam may replace all or part of the activities once performed solely by the laboratories. in particular, italy and france show higher than average percentages for this option. while spain and germany give great importance to the strengthening of the relationship with the industry, the uk is higher than average in the statement related to the tightening of the

experience and attract new users, when the need for information and support is met. macro trends / scenario 3d printing this chapter analyses the awareness and the stance about the availability of 3d printing and in specific its availability in the dental sector. chart awareness of 3d digital printing - europe the awareness among dental practices clearly is different from the laboratories (82% vs 92%), nevertheless it can be considered very high in both cases. while in the clinical market there is no relevant difference among the countries, on the laboratory side the awareness is lower in italy, france and spain. the percentage of awareness is almost the same with regard to the availability of 3d printing in dentistry, but in this case, uk shows the lowest percentage of awareness both in the clinical and technical segments. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 23 chart most suitable indications for 3d printing - europe its interesting to note that the first mentioned indications quoted by the respondents are the same for both samples, but the third one in the clinical sample, surgical guides has been quoted as the first one in the technical sample. crowns & bridges look to be relevant in both samples. chart main consequences in dentistry brought by 3d printing - europe both samples agreed on the most relevant change brought by 3d printing in dentistry would be the increase in the kinds of materials available and of the digital procedures available. in comparison to the overall results there are no relevant differences among the evaluated countries. the reduction in the price of the restorations is not seen to be a major change. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 24 macro trends / scenario conclusions the penetration of the digital technologies is higher among the dental technicians than among the dental practices, especially in the use of digital equipment. with specific regard to the dentists, the most used way to provide digital restorations is to send impressions to a third party to produce the digital restorations. however, according to the opinion of all respondents, the digital technologies will have a relevant role in the future of prosthetics, despite some grade of discomfort, mostly due to the lack of information and training. by looking at the most relevant features required by a digital technology provider, the (economic) convenience appears to be one of the most important factors to work on, in order to speed up the propagation of the new technologies. the uk and germany represent two opposite situations, where uk shows a lower than average penetration in the use of digital technologies and germany shows a rather higher than average percentage. however, german respondents seem to be rather conservative, as both, dentists and technicians show higher penetration rates, but still are the respondents who feel more uncomfortable with the technology. it is interesting to evaluate the position of spain, italy and france as countries that they firmly believe the digital technologies are the future of prosthetics and foresee a future tightening of the relationship with the industry due to the increase in the demand for case specific manufactured products. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 25 brand awareness and positioning the analysis on digital technologies went deeper with the investigation of the main brands of this segment. in specific, the brand awareness focused on the most quoted brands. the unaided awareness has shown that, among dental practices, there are a few well-known brands whose performance is very high. on the other hand, when considering the technical market, the brands mentioned by the respondents are several, to testify that the digital technologies in the laboratory are a more mature market. chart unaided brand awareness- europe sirona and 3m are the brands to be mentioned among the most relevant ones in both samples, in particular, the former is among the top three brands in both samples. the laboratory market shows several brands whose longtime presence in the laboratory market is unquestionable, and the rather low number of brands mentioned by the clinical sample testifies the relatively young business. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 26 chart brand positioning, items average scores - europe when it comes to consider the brand positioning, it must be said that the relative scores quoted by both samples are rather consistent, showing almost the same behavior. both samples gave lower than average scores for the item too expensive, good price/quality ratio and affordable, while the performance of other items related to the brand reputation and reliability received higher scores. when considering the brands individually, in the clinical market, while sirona is rather on average, its interesting to note that kavo performed better than the competitors with regard to affordability and customer service oriented, while 3m is more than other brands associated with too expensive and worldwide renowned. on the technical side, it is worth to mention bego, which is higher than average in trustworthy, but far below for too expensive, and sirona, whose performance on affordability and customer service oriented, is not on par with the other brands. zirkonzahn showed higher scores for recommendation and innovation, while amann girrbach is higher than average in good price quality ratio. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 27 chart brand positioning, bivariate correlation analysis: weight of items on the recommendation - europe the bivariate correlation analysis takes into account the relative weight of the single items on a pre- determined dependent variable, which is the recommendation. its a useful analysis which goes beyond the plain and rational score given by the respondents, and tries to assess the actual importance of the different items on the recommendation. the charts show that, apart from the item trustworthy, whose importance is unquestionable, the main ones are rather different, according to the sample considered. among laboratories, given the relative longtime presence of this kind of technologies, the recommendation seems to be mostly affected by items related to the daily practice and innovation. on the clinical side, perhaps due to the fact that the market is less mature, some items strictly linked to the reputation prevail, as if the users, or the potential users, should be mostly concerned by the confidence in the brand first. affordability, for both samples, doesnt affect the recommendation at all. chart brand positioning, factor analysis - europe key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 28 the factor analysis allows for a further data processing, where the items related to the recommendation are grouped into factors, thanks to a specific data processing. both factor analyses worked at their best when the output consisted in two factors, whose meaning and names have been the same for both groups. the first factor was nearness and the second one was reputation. even though the driving items are not exactly the same, both analysis may have the same meaning: nearness is the factor driven by items clearly related to the close relationship that a company may show, like customer service, affordability, reliability, while the second factor named reputation is made up of items in close relation to the image and reputation of a brand. chart brand positioning, factor analysis map - europe despite the factor analysis showed the same factors for both groups, the positioning maps had rather different results. the map of the dental practices sample was clearly influenced by the high weight of sirona in the analysis, whose position was in the middle of the map. a bit more scattered the map of the sample made up of dental laboratories. in the analysis on the laboratories, sirona has no central position and its brand image looks not to be related neither to the nearness, nor to the reputation. kavo brand image looks to be almost the same in both analysis, that is, more linked to the nearness and on average with regard to the reputation. other relevant topics worth to be mentioned are the position of dentsply in the analysis on the dental practices, very much related to the nearness, and the position of ivoclar vivadent in the analysis on the laboratories, which seems to be highly related to the reputation, just like zirkonzahn and, to a lesser extent, 3shape. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 29 equipment use and intention to buy the analysis on digital technologies went deeper with the investigation of the main used brands of this segment. in specific, the investigation took into consideration the brands used for scanning and for milling. chart equipment use: scanners - europe the analysis proved that the penetration of this kind equipment varies widely, according to the sample taken into consideration. the sample of dental practices made up of digital technologies users stated to use an intraoral scanner in 20% of the cases, while the corresponding sample of laboratories stated to use a scanner in 84% of the cases. for the former sample, the penetration of dental scanners related to those laboratories having a scanner for either sending outside scan files (in this case, the percentage is 55%) or to be used with an in-lab milling center. chart equipment use: brand numeric distribution, scanners - europe key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 30 it is worth to note that only sirona, 3shape and dental wings showed up in both distributions. while sirona was stated as the first one in the sample of dental practices, among laboratories 3shape is the leading company, followed by zirkonzahn and amann girrbach. chart equipment use: milling units - europe the analysis on the penetration of milling units proved to be very similar to what seen for the scanners, although the penetration of milling units in the laboratory market showed a lower percentage than that of the scanners. the percentage of milling unit users among dental practices providing digital restorations was 14%, while among the dental laboratories providing digital restorations was 34%. chart equipment use: brand numeric distribution, milling units- europe key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 31 the number of dental practices using a milling unit was rather low, therefore the information should be considered as an indication only. nevertheless, this was enough to highlight sirona dominant position by a relevant margin. the analysis by country saw sirona as the most mentioned brand everywhere and planmeca as the main follower. with regard to the sample of the laboratories, the most quoted brand was amann girrbach, followed by zirkonzahn and sirona. the analysis by country showed rather diverse situations: amann girrbach was the first one only in germany, while sirona was the top brand in italy and the uk. france saw zirkonzahn to be the most relevant one and in spain the first one was roland. additionally, the analysis on the dental laboratories also covered the numeric distribution of the manufacturers/milling centers used to send scan files or models. the most quoted one resulted to be bego, followed by heraeus kulzer, dentsply-atlantis, nobel biocare and caddent. with regard to the numeric distribution by country, its worth to note the presence of some local organizations in italy, spain and france (new ancorvis and la struttura in italy, sineldent in spain and anthogyr in france). given the rather low number of cases, the results should be taken as an indication only. chart reasons to use: scanners - europe the most quoted reasons to use mentioned by the sample of dental practices are quite different from those quoted by the dental laboratories.", "the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not

sirona still are present in the top quoted brands in overall, with top three penetration performance in several investigated countries. medit, showed an outstanding performance, and it proved to be among the most quoted brands, with top position in france and spain. 3shape was quoted more than average among labs with a higher number of dental technicians (more than 5 technicians: 44% vs 28%

in comparison to the previous edition of the omnivision digital, it is worth noting an improvement of the penetration performance by imes-icore (focused on the production of milling units only), roland and ivoclar. also, it is clear that the market is mainly made up of players focused on the production of milling systems only: roland, imes-icore, amann girrbach, vhf, zirkonzahn. among this,

thanks to an affordable price and an intensive distribution. apart from a concentration for the top position, the rest of the penetration seems to be very fragmented. the market is made up mainly of players coming from outside the traditional dental market, or present in the dental market only for 3d printing systems. anycubic received a higher than average number of quotes among smaller sized labs (1-2 technicians: 33% vs 15% overall; less than 10 served practices: 22%).", "7 executive summary ios: limits and barriers among those who do not own a scanner, 30% cite excessive cost as a major issue. internet connectivity and digital reliability are minor concerns. price sensitivity varies by country: 20% in france view price as a significant barrier, while nearly 50% in spain see it as such. full arch scanning is less problematic in france but more relevant in spain. in spain, team mindset and compatibility with laboratories are also significant concerns, along with some issues related to compatibility with aligner brands. usefulness of ios the perceived usefulness of the scanner is high in all analyzed situations, with particular emphasis on time optimization, clinical effectiveness, and internal planning. in spain, the scanner is considered less useful for time optimization compared to other countries, while in italy it is positively evaluated across all areas. in france, the focus is primarily on optimization and clinical effectiveness, with less attention given to communication and marketing. differences between owners and non-owners are evident, especially regarding the use for communication and marketing. segmentation 8 before addressing the questions related to purchasing behavior and the evaluation of the new straumann proposal, some information is provided regarding possible useful segmentation parameters, particularly related to the use of implants and aligners. eventual statistical significance will be highlighted according this segmentation parameters. 9 segmentation parameters 121 cases 123 cases 127 cases the main segmentation parameters related to the structures (center size, number of dentists, and year of establishment) and the respondent (age and any specializations) have been considered in the analysis of the results. *the total number of dentists is obtained by adding the number of full-time dentists and the number of

analysis of the implantology market. however, it is very useful for cross-referencing data related to the value proposition of the new scanner concerning the main brands being used. straumann and dentsply sirona implant customers has been highlighted because both companies offer their own ios and are multi-brand. 10 how many implants do you approximately place in a year in your dental practice? which implant brands do you use in order of importance in your dental practice? base: 371 (total sample) fr it es 30% 21% 15% 15% 13% 15% 19% 7% 14% 12% 9% 5% 17% 4% 21% 15% 2% 10% 3% 8% 1%

practiced in almost every dental practice except france the research shows that implantology is practiced in almost all dental practices, except in france (greater specialization). in spain, there is a higher proportion of heavy implant users (highly developed implantology market). in france, orthodontics specifically aligners, represent still a niche market (mainly due to regulatory reasons). on the contrary aligners are extensively used in italy and spain. while these data are not intended for an analysis of the aligner market, they are very useful for profiling the subsequent responses related to this topic. align technology, dentsply sirona, and straumann are the three largest groups among companies that offer scanners, making it important to analyze any differences in purchase behavior and perception among their respective customers. aligners users 11 how many aligners do you approximately place in a year in your dental practice? which aligner brands do you use in order of importance in your dental practice? base: 371 (total sample) fr it es 52% 61% 74% 11% 7% 21% 9% 4% 11% 15% 5% 6% 3% 7% 5% 16% 1% 7% 2% 1% 4% 6% 5% other mentioned brands account for 21% (fr: 25%; it:

and behaviors of customers of consumable products and services from align technologies, straumann, and dentsply sirona can be analyzed separately with the intention to separately evaluate the results of straumanns customers, users of straumann, neodent, and anthogyr implants, as well as clearcorrect, were grouped together. this allowed for the definition of a statistically significant segment of 89 cases. during the analysis, it was noted that dentsply sironas customers (implants and aligners) also represent a statistically significant segment, as do the 171 invisalign users. the segmentation questions conducted on the sample allowed for the identification of customers from three companies, whose statistical representativeness is considered sufficient to attempt to identify potential differences in purchase behavior perception. for convenience, these three companies are referred to in the charts with the following abbreviations: align technologies (alt), straumann (str), and dentsply sirona (ds). this segmentation explicitly excludes owners of itero or dentsply sirona scanners because the same parameter cannot be used for straumann, which has not yet been mentioned as a scanner brand (the 39 itero owners and 43 ds scanner owners were nonetheless isolated for possible considerations). ios penetration 13 prospective buyers from future and current owners 14 do you have intraoral scanners in your practice? base: 371 (total sample) across countries, there are no significant differences except in spain, where it was found a higher rate of non-owners who are considering a purchase: among the prospects in spain, non-owners make up 50%. in italy, those who already own a scanner have a greater presence. the proportion of non-owners among prospects is much higher among those over 54 and in smaller dental practices. the prospects can be categorized into two groups: potential future owners (about 40% of the sample) who don't own a scanner, and current owners (about 60% of the sample) who wish to purchase additional scanners. previous and recent surveys confirm that among repurchasers, 80% plan to add more while 20% plan to substitute the current technology. however, in practices with two or more scanners, the focus shifts toward replacing older scanners. this trend is influenced by the size of the dental practice and the age of their initial scanners. those who already own ios represent a highly relevant and strategic segment 61% of respondents own an ios scanner owner prospects 39% of respondents are prospects non-owner prospects ios owner prospects: period of purchase 15 what is the year of purchase of your intraoral scanner? base: 227 (respondents who have ios) the market potential of those who already own a quite recent ios should not be overlooked, but price sensitivity is a discriminant factor focusing on prospects who already own scanners (repurchasers), it was observed that over 70% of the sample has made a recent purchase, indicating a strong likelihood of intending to buy additional machines. however, it is important not to overlook the impact of pricing strategies in italy and spain, where aggressive bundling offers (especially in spain) and significant tax incentives (in italy) starting at the end of 2020 have driven prices down significantly (on average, reducing the investment by 50% compared to the supplier's agreed price, with reductions of nearly 90% in southern italy due to a second tax incentive). this trend of paying a very reduced price for scanners in recent years, due to commercial or fiscal reasons, has influenced the price perception, particularly among those who already own scanners, especially if they purchased them recently. this information was gathered to assess potential differences in behavior and evaluations of straumann's scanner value proposition. hence, the purpose of this data analysis is to provide new insights when examining purchase behavior and value propositions. owners only ios owner prospects: installed brands considering only the prospects intending to make a purchase, it is interesting to evaluate purchasing behavior and the assessment of straumann's value proposition based on the brands already owned. it was found a strong presence of medit in france and a significant presence of align technology in spain: these are two factors to be considered. it is also noteworthy that 3shape is more prevalent among the younger audience. given the number of cases, this analysis is not an evaluation of the installed base of equipment but aims to identify those who own specific brands to see if they have different purchasing intentions and if they evaluate straumann's value proposition differently compared to those using other brands. 16 what

who do mention them place significant importance.", "frequency of recommendation increases as the labs size and their digitization level increase. this is also true for labs performing a higher-than-average number of ortho cases with aligners. currently, spain is the country with the lowest penetration of ios but with higher growth rates and in full digitalization process. labo the laboratories state that they are approached by dentists with a certain frequency. a frequent approach is considered to be 'monthly' to 'daily'. although the frequency of approach is fairly homogeneous

asked by the clinician, do you recommend a specific intra-oral scanner brand? which intra-oral scanner brand do you recommend most often? 3shape is quoted more than average among big sized labs (49%), by the lab owners (39%), less recently open structures and those stating the business has decreased (40% and 46% respectively). itero is quoted more than average among more recently open labs (25%) and among labs receiving a high share of scan files (22%). less than average among labs performing a high share of prosthetic complex cases (12%). medit is quoted more than average among labs receiving a lower share of scan files (23%). dentsply sirona is quoted more than average among labs receiving scan files from more than half of clients (20%). labo recommendation is very high: on an overall basis, at least 90% of the laboratories approached by dentists recommend a brand. 3shape is the most recommended brand in spain and italy, while itero is most recommended in the uk. carestream has adopted a very widespread distribution and commercial strategy, which explains the high number of recommendations in italy (achieving a significantly higher penetration than in the other analysed countries). diverse recommended brands across the surveyed countries: 3shape is most quoted, itero is main follower. why do you recommend the mentioned ios brand? (multiple choice) scanner performance and clinic / lab integration are the most quoted reasons. brand reputation is quoted more often among bigger sized labs (62%) and those performing ortho cases with invisible aligners (58%). the latter also quote community more often than average (20%). integration is quoted more often by labs serving a higher number of practices (60%). service / post sales support is more often quoted by labs receiving a higher share of scan files (46%). base: 440 cases intraoral scanners brands when receiving scan files what are the top 3 brands of the intra-oral

more than average by bigger sized labs (73%) and so is for dentsply sirona (52%). again, 3shape is quoted more than average by labs equipped with a milling unit (62%) and 3d printer (60%). itero (52%) and medit (35%) are more often quoted among recently open labs. exocad users do show higher than average quotes for itero (46%). dentsply sirona is more than average quoted by labs receiving scan files from more than 50% of their clients (62%). full digital workflow labo base: 524 cases intraoral scanners brands: recommendation vs scan files reception when asked by the clinician, which

relationship between the brand of the ios from which the scan is received and the recommendation of the ios brand has been investigated. the results show that 3shape has the highest relationship between the brand from which the labs receive the scanner and the recommendation. it is also true that 3shape, due to its popularity and seniority in the ios market, has a high frequency of recommendation even in labs receiving scans from other brands. in fact, it is always cited as the second brand regardless of the brand of ios from which the labs receive scans (for carestream it is the first). this also shows that 3shape's reputation is very high. base: 524 cases 3shape dentsply sirona itero medit carestream planmeca 3shape 55% 26% 29% 24% 33% 17% dentsply sirona 12% 30% 9% 5%

but it is worth to underline that in germany this penetration of milling units is historically higher due to the presence of the so called practice lab. for both uk and germany, the higher presence of dentsply sirona make the penetration of this equipment higher than average.", "also, the responses from the laboratories make understand that the increase in the productivity is felt to be an important feature that the digital technologies have to bring. chart reasons to use: milling units - europe efficiency, simplification of the procedures and overall increased quality over the traditional prosthetics procedures are among the most relevant reasons mentioned for use of a chairside milling, or a milling unit at the lab. in this case, the results of the dentists sample are not very different from those of laboratories. chart intention to buy: scanners/milling units - europe its interesting to note that the more mature technical market also shows a lower percentage of intention to by a scanner/milling unit than the dental practices. and again, when it comes to the evaluation of this indicator by country, germany shows the lowest percentages of intention to buy. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 33 with regard to the clinical sample, the countries showing the highest percentages of intention to buy are italy and spain, while among the laboratories, the countries are italy and france. among the most relevant reasons for not buying a scanner/milling unit, there are the lack of need, therefore it is not felt necessary, so it may be a good point for future commercial actions by the companies involved in this segment, and the excessive cost, together with the fact that a good portion of respondents still feel the traditional method to be the most preferred one. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 34 customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics the analysis of the overall scores of the customer satisfaction highlighted the relatively lower scores given by the sample of dental practices in comparison to the results showed by the dental laboratories. although the quality seems to be unquestionable, the same item accuracy and quality of the restorations showed an average of 7,8 in the sample of dental practices, while among laboratories it showed a score of 8,3 and for both it was the highest score among all investigated items. the other items to be the most satisfactory for both samples, were handiness/ease of use and wide range of materials available, which somehow match the needs expressed by both samples in the analysis of the most important reasons to use. reliability completes the list of the most relevant items that received the highest satisfaction scores, while, on the bottom side there is the price area, with the items overall running costs and cost of sw updates, which received among the lowest scores. the correlation analysis will explain which items are more relevant in the assessment of the overall satisfaction and if there are critical items to be monitored closely. chart customer satisfaction: bivariate correlation analysis: weight of items on the overall satisfaction europe its interesting to note that no item related to the assistance and support has been mentioned among the most satisfactory items. given the high technology content of this specific product segment, the support from the company becomes crucial and the multiple correlation analysis highlighted the importance of some items - related to the support and assistance from the manufacturer whose satisfaction score was not ranked among the highest ones. overall running cost, which resulted to be a key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 35 rather unsatisfactory item, looks to be more important to the dental practices, in the assessment of the overall satisfaction, than to the laboratories. chart customer satisfaction: bivariate correlation analysis map - europe in the lower right side of the maps there are the items whose satisfaction was not high, but whose weight on the overall satisfaction has to be considered higher than average, thus representing, from an overall point of view, key factor of success. in the sample of dental practices, the analysis highlighted the support and the assistance from the manufacturer, along with the running costs, to be critical in the assessment of the overall satisfaction. the sample of dental laboratories highlighted, other than the assistance in case of repair, a clear need for sw updates and flexibility from the manufacturer to meet the needs of their customers (laboratories). if the analysis is performed on the single manufacturers, the key factors of success become weak items, because their importance is high, but their satisfaction score is lower than average and all most relevant items mentioned for the overall analysis are present as weak items in the analysis by brand. on the laboratory side, its worth to highlight the weaknesses related to the service and support area for sirona, the running costs (overall and sw updates) and flexibility for amann girrbach and, in general, a lack of satisfaction in the area of assistance and support. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 36 chart customer satisfaction, factor analysis - europe the factor analysis (4 factors) performed on the customer satisfaction items highlighted, as happened with the recommendation, almost the same items. management costs and compatibility were exactly the same, while the first two were slightly different. in the clinical sample the quality of the product is joint to the quality of the service, thus making just one factor product and service quality, while in the sample of dental laboratories the product quality is alone and the service is part of a different factor focused on the area of support and assistance. the technical assistance and support make the difference: for the dental practices, they belong to the first factor, while for the laboratory they belong to the second one. chart customer satisfaction, multiple regression analysis - europe this analysis takes care of assessing how much the single factors affect the overall satisfaction. as previously seen in the factor analysis, the technical assistance and support look to be important, because in the sample of dental practices the first factor, which includes those items, weights far more than the other ones (43%), while in the sample of dental laboratories is the second factor again, including those factors the most important one, with 33% of weight on the overall satisfaction. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 37 also, its worth to underline the relative higher importance of the cost items for the dental practices, given that the factor management costs weights 26% vs 18% for the dental laboratories. conclusions the brand awareness highlighted a not negligible influence by the digital technologies in general, especially with regard to the dental practices, where some brands may have seen their performance affected by market segments like digital x-ray and digital guided surgery for dental implants. sirona resulted to be by far the brand with the most relevant performance, especially among dental practices. as for the dental laboratories, the performance of sirona faces the presence of other brands like 3shape, dental wings, zirkonzahn and amann girrbach. the factor analysis highlighted a possible positioning of the mentioned brands according to two main factors, the nearness and the reputation possibly affecting the recommendation. while on the sample of dental practices the positioning resulted to be rather affected by the performance of sirona, whose position was not distinctive, the analysis performed on the dental laboratories highlighted kavo positioning to be more related to the nearness, and so was for bego, while other brands like ivoclar vivadent, 3shape and zirkonzahn have been more linked to the reputation. the use of the different equipment is more widespread among the dental laboratories, whose penetration resulted to be far higher than the dental practices. the fact that the technical market may be considered rather more mature than the clinical one, is proved by the intention to buy digital equipment in the future, whose value was just 12% versus 21% of the dental practices. the brand numeric distribution highlighted a higher number of competitors present in the technical segment than the clinical one, and the distribution highlighted the same brands mentioned in the awareness analysis. the most important reasons to use mentioned by the respondents were related to ease of use, comfort, quality and efficiency, other than the possibility offered by this kind of technology to shorten the production workflow and increase the productivity, but the multivariate analysis performed on the satisfaction highlighted some critical items related to the service and support from the manufacturers, which didnt receive fully satisfactory scores, but whose importance in the assessment of the overall satisfaction was above average. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 38 appendix: production dental laboratories chart indirect digital restorations production (calculation from number of restorations) - europe the overall production of digital indirect restorations showed a higher than average performance from germany, followed by the uk, which, although is the country with the lowest percentage of digital technologies users among the investigated countries, highlighted a rather high production among the users of this technology (given the low number of cases, this information should be taken as an indication only). the lowest production comes from italy. chart indirect digital restorations production breakdown by material (calculation from number of restorations) - europe key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 39 the statements from the respondents proved the zirconia to be the most used one, followed by cocr. germany shows a higher than average use of zirconia, while some others, such as france and spain, look to make more use of cocr. lithium disilicate seems to be more than average used in italy and uk. given the low number of cases, the information regarding the countries should be considered as a qualitative information. appendix: production dental practices chart overall indirect restorations production, breakdown by technology (calculation from number of restorations) - europe the production which resulted from the dental practices highlighted a high predominance of the conventional restorations, that is, receiving the indirect traditional restorations from the laboratory. also in this case, its worth to underline an important production in the uk, in spain and italy, where the sample showed the highest percentage in the use of the chairside milling. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 40 chart overall indirect restorations production with chairside milling unit, breakdown by type of restoration (calculation from number of restorations) - europe in overall, the most often stated kind of productions proved to be inlays and onlays, followed by implant based and

the approach of the laboratories is not very different from that of dental practices, as the majority of the respondents state to believe the digital prosthetics will have a relevant role but the traditional prosthetics will be relevant in the future, too. in specific regard to this statement, the percentage (70%) is higher than dental practices (54%). interesting the position of uk, different from the other countries, where a more relevant part of respondents believe that digital technologies will not have a relevant role. clearly the german market, given its weight, influences the overall results, but its interesting to note how the most mature market regarding digital technologies, the german one, believes the new technologies will have a relevant role, nevertheless, the traditional

will be important in the future, however they are not going to completely replace the traditional way. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 12 its interesting to note how the majority of respondents declared the new digital technologies will play an important role, in overall this feeling is true for 54% of respondents, but they will not replace the way the traditional restorations are performed. the highest percentage of respondents stating that digital technologies will replace most of the traditional restorations is in spain and italy, followed by france. the statement of those countries may have a correlation with use. this may mean that those countries using more digital technologies are more convinced than others that this technology will replace the traditional prosthesis. the feeling that the digital technologies will not replace completely the traditional prosthetics is almost the same among respondents not providing digital restorations, but is lower than average the percentage of responses related to the fact that the digital technologies will completely replace the traditional prosthetics (27% vs 31% overall). digital technology acceptance in dental offices stance versus digital technologies at this stage, the level of acceptance of the digital technologies was evaluated, with specific regard to how much the dentists feel comfortable with the new technologies. chart dental practices stance to digital technologies europe vs. breakdown per country the sample is rather split between those trying to get closer to digital technologies and those feeling uncomfortable with them. the percentage of respondents using it and feeling comfortable with it, still are the minority at 13%. the highest percentages are in italy, spain and uk. its interesting to correlate the digital technology penetration (chart digital technologies offer) with the stance. for example, germany has the second highest level of penetration (35% of the practices offer restorations with digital technologies) but respondents generally look to feel more uncomfortable with it (57% that feels uncomfortable using the technology versus 38% in overall). key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 13 relationship among dentists, technicians and the industry in the future of digital technologies besides the analysis on the current use and penetration of digital technologies, it is also interesting to investigate how the relationship among dentists, technicians, and the industry will progress and interact in the future, due to the relevant changes that the digital technologies may bring to their daily work. chart change in the relationship among dentists, technicians and the industry europe vs. breakdown per country the major part of the quotes is in the direction of a tighter cooperation between dentists and technicians and also between dentists and the industry, due to the increasing need for specific manufactured products that the industry can provide. the results also show that uk respondents firmly believe in a future strengthening of the relationship between dentists and technicians with 50% of quotes, versus 34% of the total sample. in other hand, the majority of the practices in germany (36% versus the overall average of 24%) believes that the relationship will become blander as they believe the process with cad-cam is easier and do not require a specific knowledge. chart change in the way restorations are performed - europe vs. breakdown per country key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 14 the sample is rather split evenly between those feeling the type of restorations will not change, and those thinking that there will be a change. the major differences come from germany and uk, where there are the major part of respondents stating there will be no change. it looks like the major changes brought by the digital technologies are mostly related to the material used (more use of zirconia and cocr instead of alloys) and the fact that there may be a higher production of fixed prosthetics instead of removable one. required features from digital technology providers chart what dentists expect from a digital technology provider, in order to improve and enhance the way they perform restorations and prosthetics - europe a manufacturer will clearly need to give support to digital technology users, in terms of training and information and in terms of improvement in the performance. an interesting assumption may be that the unfamiliarity is the driver making dentists to ask for training and information for either start using digital technologies or to use them in a better and more effective way. at second place, the statements about convenience reflect the desire to receive from the manufacturers services and/or products that can make their work easier, more affordable and more productive. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 15 macro trends / scenario laboratories this chapter analyses the point of view of the dental laboratories about digital technologies, the use, the acceptance and the impacts. the dental laboratories were invited to state what they think about their future role in the production of the digital restorations, and about their relationship with the main players involved in this digital change: the dental practices, the laboratories themselves and the industry. use of digital technologies in dental laboratories indirect restorations performed with digital technologies more than half of the sample (57%) stated to provide their clients with digital restorations. germany and spain are the countries showing the highest percentages. again, german laboratories are the ones providing more often than others prostheses made with digital technologies: 37% of laboratories (vs. 31% overall) provides this service on a regular basis. like in all investigated countries, the percentage of laboratories providing digital restorations is higher than the percentage of practices doing so. again the percentage in uk is considerably lower than the overall result. chart use of digital technologies in dental laboratories - europe vs. breakdown per country key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 16 use of digital technologies breakdown by technology and channel the portion of the sample providing digital restorations was requested to specify how they do that. chart use of digital technologies breakdown by technology the most common way to produce digital restorations is to produce scan files (55%) to be sent outside to an external organization (either a partner lab or a manufacturer/milling center). a good portion of the sample uses at least a milling unit installed at their laboratory (34%). chart use of digital technologies breakdown by technology europe vs. breakdown per country germany, france and the uk are

the total scanner users (red circled data, respondents using a scanner to send the scan files outside for milling), in 11% of the cases they also have an in-lab milling at the laboratory, and in 10% of the cases they also send the models outside for milling (either to a manufacturer/milling center or a partner lab). on the other hand, with regard to the channel users, out of the total manufacturer users (blue circled data, respondents sending either the models or scan files to a manufacturer/milling center), in 91% of the cases they send the scan files to a manufacturer, in 11% of the cases they have an in-lab milling, and in 19% of the cases they also send their models outside for milling to a manufacturer. this is a kind of multiple answer question. also, the same information is available with the channels in rows, and in the columns there are again both the channels and the technologies. the information can be read as follows: with regard to the technology users, out of the total scanner users (red circled data, respondents sending their scan files outside for milling), in 85% of key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 19 the cases, they send the scan files to the manufacturer/milling center channel, in 44% of the cases they also send the scan files to a partner lab, and 11% of them also have an in-lab milling. on the other hand, with regard to the channel users, out of the total partner lab users (blue circled data, respondents sending their models or scan files to a partner lab), 48% of them also send their models or scan files to a manufacturer/milling center and 11% of them also have an in-lab milling.", "considering the reduced number of cases, this information can be only considered as an indication. chart use of digital technologies breakdown by technology with regard to the technologies used, the traditional impression is by far the most used one. 14% of the respondents use a chairside milling, and 11% of respondents stated to use an intraoral scanner with which they send the scans outside (to a partner lab or a manufacturer/milling center) for milling. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 10 chart use of digital technologies breakdown by technology europe vs. breakdown per country the analysis by country highlights italy as the one with the highest penetration of intraoral scanners and chairside milling users among digital restorations providers. despite a low number of cases, uk shows a different behavior compared to the rest of the evaluated countries, with a higher than average percentages shown in the use of both intraoral scanners and chairside milling units.", "the map shows that almost all most relevant items are placed in the critical area. given a rather low number of cases, it is recommended to consider the results as a qualitative indication. digital technology penetration digital technology use: breakdown by technology taking into considerations all the elements made with cad-cam systems, what percentage do you use the following technologies? technologies base: 405 cases (digital restorations providers) 66 percentage of laboratories among digital technology users, the most used technology is scanner and the most used way to provide digital restorations is to send scans to a manufacturer or milling center. 63% is the percent of scanner owners, out of the total digital restorations providers, who use the scanner to send the files outside for milling. in comparison to year 2015, scanner owners increased remarkably, along with milling center owners. on the other hand, the percentage of full outsourcing providers showed a relevant decrease. since laboratories may use different technologies and channels, the sum of percentages is higher than 100%. digital technology use: breakdown by technology taking into considerations all the elements made with cad-cam systems, what percentage do you use the following supply

cad-cam frame materials scanners: numeric distribution what is the brand of your scanners, including the one(s) possibly used with your milling unit? total scanners (330 cases) scans sent outside (242 cases) the numeric distribution is the percentage of clients that mentioned to use a certain brand, or to get delivered by a certain supplier. thats why it is comparable with the coverage index, it is a subjective value, related to the brand or supplier which is named by the clients as their brand or their supplier. open technologies have certainly increased their presence among the spanish dental labs, and dentsply sirona improved its position too. 71 in-house milling units: numeric distribution what is the brand of your milling unit? base: 139 cases (milling units owners) 72 the numeric

value, related to the brand or supplier which is named by the clients as their brand or their supplier. as for the milling units, vhf and amann girrbach have increased their performance over the last years. manufacturer milling centers: numeric distribution considering the scans and the models sent to manufacturers / milling centers, what is the name of those manufacturers / milling centers? base: 205 cases (manufacturer users) 73 the numeric distribution is the percentage of clients that mentioned to use a certain brand, or to get delivered by a certain supplier. thats why it is comparable with the coverage index, it is a subjective value, related to the brand or supplier which is named by the clients as their brand or their supplier. as regards the scans/models sent outside for milling, when comparing the results with the 2015 edition, it is interesting to note the spreading of specialized milling centers, such as ideas medical solution, while sineldent confirms its leading position among the centralized milling centers in spain. cad-cam frames materials: numeric distribution q: what are the brands of the cad-cam materials (blocks or discs) that you use with your milling

(cad-cam / 3d printing) within the next year? 75 18% of those not performing fixed prosthetics using digital technologies plan to start within a year. this percentage increases among laboratories with three or more technicians (31%) and among those declaring a positive perception with respect to the future of their business (27%). if, on one hand, the intention to buy have increased remarkably in recent years - in 2012 only 7% of those not providing digitally produced prosthesis declared they would have done - with the wide spreading of the digital technology, still there seem to be a hard socket of those somehow adverse to it, as the very slight change from 2015 (16%) to 2018 (18%) demonstrates. the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. base: 159 cases (not providing digital restorations) 2015: 25 cases intention to buy intention to buy technology intention to buy: why not are you planning to start providing fixed prosthesis elements produced with digital technologies (cad-cam / 3d printing) within the next year?", "also, the responses from the laboratories make understand that the increase in the productivity is felt to be an important feature that the digital technologies have to bring. chart reasons to use: milling units - europe efficiency, simplification of the procedures and overall increased quality over the traditional prosthetics procedures are among the most relevant reasons mentioned for use of a chairside milling, or a milling unit at the lab. in this case, the results of the dentists sample are not very different from those of laboratories. chart intention to buy: scanners/milling units - europe its interesting to note that the more mature technical market also shows a lower percentage of intention to by a scanner/milling unit than the dental practices. and again, when it comes to the evaluation of this indicator by country, germany shows the lowest percentages of intention to buy. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 33 with regard to the clinical sample, the countries showing the highest percentages of intention to buy are italy and spain, while among the laboratories, the countries are italy and france. among the most relevant reasons for not buying a scanner/milling unit, there are the lack of need, therefore it is not felt necessary, so it may be a good point for future commercial actions by the companies involved in this segment, and the excessive cost, together with the fact that a good portion of respondents still feel the traditional method to be the most preferred one. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 34 customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics the analysis of the overall scores of the customer satisfaction highlighted the relatively lower scores given by the sample of dental practices in comparison to the results showed by the dental laboratories. although the quality seems to be unquestionable, the same item accuracy and quality of the restorations showed an average of 7,8 in the sample of dental practices, while among laboratories it showed a score of 8,3 and for both it was the highest score among all investigated items. the other items to be the most satisfactory for both samples, were handiness/ease of use and wide range of materials available, which somehow match the needs expressed by both samples in the analysis of the most important reasons to use. reliability completes the list of the most relevant items that received the highest satisfaction scores, while, on the bottom side there is the price area, with the items overall running costs and cost of sw updates, which received among the lowest scores. the correlation analysis will explain which items are more relevant in the assessment of the overall satisfaction and if there are critical items to be monitored closely. chart customer satisfaction: bivariate correlation analysis: weight of items on the overall satisfaction europe its interesting to note that no item related to the assistance and support has been mentioned among the most satisfactory items. given the high technology content of this specific product segment, the support from the company becomes crucial and the multiple correlation analysis highlighted the importance of some items - related to the support and assistance from the manufacturer whose satisfaction score was not ranked among the highest ones. overall running cost, which resulted to be a key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 35 rather unsatisfactory item, looks to be more important to the dental practices, in the assessment of the overall satisfaction, than to the laboratories. chart customer satisfaction: bivariate correlation analysis map - europe in the lower right side of the maps there are the items whose satisfaction was not high, but whose weight on the overall satisfaction has to be considered higher than average, thus representing, from an overall point of view, key factor of success. in the sample of dental practices, the analysis highlighted the support and the assistance from the manufacturer, along with the running costs, to be critical in the assessment of the overall satisfaction. the sample of dental laboratories highlighted, other than the assistance in case of repair, a clear need for sw updates and flexibility from the manufacturer to meet the needs of their customers (laboratories). if the analysis is performed on the single manufacturers, the key factors of success become weak items, because their importance is high, but their satisfaction score is lower than average and all most relevant items mentioned for the overall analysis are present as weak items in the analysis by brand. on the laboratory side, its worth to highlight the weaknesses related to the service and support area for sirona, the running costs (overall and sw updates) and flexibility for amann girrbach and, in general, a lack of satisfaction in the area of assistance and support. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 36 chart customer satisfaction, factor analysis - europe the factor analysis (4 factors) performed on the customer satisfaction items highlighted, as happened with the recommendation, almost the same items. management costs and compatibility were exactly the same, while the first two were slightly different. in the clinical sample the quality of the product is joint to the quality of the service, thus making just one factor product and service quality, while in the sample of dental laboratories the product quality is alone and the service is part of a different factor focused on the area of support and assistance. the technical assistance and support make the difference: for the dental practices, they belong to the first factor, while for the laboratory they belong to the second one. chart customer satisfaction, multiple regression analysis - europe this analysis takes care of assessing how much the single factors affect the overall satisfaction. as previously seen in the factor analysis, the technical assistance and support look to be important, because in the sample of dental practices the first factor, which includes those items, weights far more than the other ones (43%), while in the sample of dental laboratories is the second factor again, including those factors the most important one, with 33% of weight on the overall satisfaction. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 37 also, its worth to underline the relative higher importance of the cost items for the dental practices, given that the factor management costs weights 26% vs 18% for the dental laboratories. conclusions the brand awareness highlighted a not negligible influence by the digital technologies in general, especially with regard to the dental practices, where some brands may have seen their performance affected by market segments like digital x-ray and digital guided surgery for dental implants. sirona resulted to be by far the brand with the most relevant performance, especially among dental practices. as for the dental laboratories, the performance of sirona faces the presence of other brands like 3shape, dental wings, zirkonzahn and amann girrbach. the factor analysis highlighted a possible positioning of the mentioned brands according to two main factors, the nearness and the reputation possibly affecting the recommendation. while on the sample of dental practices the positioning resulted to be rather affected by the performance of sirona, whose position was not distinctive, the analysis performed on the dental laboratories highlighted kavo positioning to be more related to the nearness, and so was for bego, while other brands like ivoclar vivadent, 3shape and zirkonzahn have been more linked to the reputation. the use of the different equipment is more widespread among the dental laboratories, whose penetration resulted to be far higher than the dental practices. the fact that the technical market may be considered rather more mature than the clinical one, is proved by the intention to buy digital equipment in the future, whose value was just 12% versus 21% of the dental practices. the brand numeric distribution highlighted a higher number of competitors present in the technical segment than the clinical one, and the distribution highlighted the same brands mentioned in the awareness analysis. the most important reasons to use mentioned by the respondents were related to ease of use, comfort, quality and efficiency, other than the possibility offered by this kind of technology to shorten the production workflow and increase the productivity, but the multivariate analysis performed on the satisfaction highlighted some critical items related to the service and support from the manufacturers, which didnt receive fully satisfactory scores, but whose importance in the assessment of the overall satisfaction was above average. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 38 appendix: production dental laboratories chart indirect digital restorations production (calculation from number of restorations) - europe the overall production of digital indirect restorations showed a higher than average performance from germany, followed by the uk, which, although is the country with the lowest percentage of digital technologies users among the investigated countries, highlighted a rather high production among the users of this technology (given the low number of cases, this information should be taken as an indication only). the lowest production comes from italy. chart indirect digital restorations production breakdown by material (calculation from number of restorations) - europe key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 39 the statements from the respondents proved the zirconia to be the most used one, followed by cocr. germany shows a higher than average use of zirconia, while some others, such as france and spain, look to make more use of cocr. lithium disilicate seems to be more than average used in italy and uk. given the low number of cases, the information regarding the countries should be considered as a qualitative information. appendix: production dental practices chart overall indirect restorations production, breakdown by technology (calculation from number of restorations) - europe the production which resulted from the dental practices highlighted a high predominance of the conventional restorations, that is, receiving the indirect traditional restorations from the laboratory. also in this case, its worth to underline an important production in the uk, in spain and italy, where the sample showed the highest percentage in the use of the chairside milling. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 40 chart overall indirect restorations production with chairside milling unit, breakdown by type of restoration (calculation from number of restorations) - europe in overall, the most often stated kind of productions proved to be inlays and onlays, followed by implant based and

penetration performance in france, spain and the uk. in comparison to the previous edition of the omnivision digital, it is worth noting an improvement of the penetration performance by imes-icore (focused on the production of milling units only), roland and ivoclar. also, it is clear that the market is mainly made up of players focused on the production of milling systems only: roland,

penetration seems to be very fragmented. the market is made up mainly of players coming from outside the traditional dental market, or present in the dental market only for 3d printing systems.

barriers among those who do not own a scanner, 30% cite excessive cost as a major issue. internet connectivity and digital reliability are minor concerns. price sensitivity varies by country: 20% in france view price as a significant barrier, while nearly 50% in spain see it as such. full arch scanning is less problematic in france but more relevant in spain. in spain, team mindset and compatibility with laboratories are also significant concerns, along with some issues related to compatibility with aligner brands. usefulness of ios the perceived usefulness of the scanner is high in all analyzed situations, with particular emphasis on time optimization, clinical effectiveness, and internal planning. in spain, the scanner is considered less useful for time optimization compared to other countries, while in italy it is positively evaluated across all areas. in france, the focus is primarily on optimization and clinical effectiveness, with less attention given to communication and marketing. differences between owners and non-owners are evident, especially regarding the use for communication and marketing. segmentation 8 before addressing the questions related to purchasing behavior and the evaluation of the new straumann proposal, some information is provided regarding possible useful segmentation parameters, particularly related to the use of implants and aligners. eventual statistical significance will be highlighted according this segmentation parameters. 9 segmentation parameters 121 cases 123 cases 127 cases the main segmentation parameters related to the structures (center size, number of dentists, and year of establishment) and the respondent (age and any specializations) have been considered in the analysis of the results. *the total number of

potential ios buyers and therefore is not representative for conducting an analysis of the implantology market. however, it is very useful for cross-referencing data related to the value proposition of the new scanner concerning the main brands being used. straumann and dentsply sirona implant customers has been highlighted because both companies offer their own ios and are multi-brand. 10 how

responses provided and comprise 72 brands. implantology is practiced in almost every dental practice except france the research shows that implantology is practiced in almost all dental practices, except in france (greater specialization). in spain, there is a higher proportion of heavy implant users (highly developed implantology market). in france, orthodontics specifically aligners, represent still a niche market (mainly due to regulatory reasons). on the contrary aligners are extensively used in italy and spain. while these data are not intended for an analysis of the aligner market, they are very useful for profiling the subsequent responses related to this topic. align technology, dentsply sirona, and straumann are the three largest groups among companies that offer scanners, making it important to analyze any differences in purchase behavior and perception among their respective customers. aligners users 11 how many aligners do you approximately place in a year

consumable customer segmentation 12 base: 371 (total sample) opinions and behaviors of customers of consumable products and services from align technologies, straumann, and dentsply sirona can be analyzed separately with the intention to separately evaluate the results of straumanns customers, users of straumann, neodent, and anthogyr implants, as well as clearcorrect, were grouped together. this allowed for the definition of a statistically significant segment of 89 cases. during the analysis, it was noted that dentsply sironas customers (implants and aligners) also represent a statistically significant segment, as do the 171 invisalign users. the segmentation questions conducted on the sample allowed for the identification of customers from three companies, whose statistical representativeness is considered sufficient to attempt to identify potential differences in purchase behavior perception. for convenience, these three companies are referred to in the charts with the following abbreviations: align technologies (alt), straumann (str), and dentsply sirona (ds). this segmentation explicitly excludes owners of itero or dentsply sirona scanners because the same parameter cannot be used for straumann, which has not yet been mentioned as a scanner brand (the 39 itero owners and 43 ds scanner owners were nonetheless isolated for possible considerations). ios penetration 13 prospective buyers from future and current owners 14 do you have intraoral scanners in your practice? base: 371 (total sample) across countries, there are no significant differences except in spain, where it was found a higher rate of non-owners who are considering a purchase: among the prospects in spain, non-owners make up 50%. in italy, those who already own a scanner have a greater presence. the proportion of non-owners among prospects is much higher among those over 54 and in smaller dental practices. the prospects can be categorized into two groups: potential future owners (about 40% of the sample) who don't own a scanner, and current owners (about 60% of the sample) who wish to purchase additional scanners. previous and recent surveys confirm that among repurchasers, 80% plan to add more while 20% plan to substitute the current technology. however, in practices with two or more scanners, the focus shifts toward replacing older scanners. this trend is influenced by the size of the dental practice and the age of their initial scanners. those who already own ios represent a highly relevant and strategic segment 61% of respondents own an ios scanner owner prospects 39% of respondents are prospects non-owner prospects ios owner prospects: period of purchase 15 what is the year of purchase of your intraoral scanner? base: 227 (respondents who have ios) the market potential of those who already own a quite recent ios should not be overlooked, but price sensitivity is a discriminant factor focusing on prospects who already own scanners (repurchasers), it was observed that over 70% of the sample has made a recent purchase, indicating a strong likelihood of intending to buy additional machines. however, it is important not to overlook the impact of pricing strategies in italy and spain, where aggressive bundling offers (especially in spain) and significant tax incentives (in italy) starting at the end of 2020 have driven prices down significantly (on average, reducing the investment by 50% compared to the supplier's agreed price, with reductions of nearly 90% in southern italy due to a second tax incentive). this trend of paying a very reduced price for scanners in recent years, due to commercial or fiscal reasons, has influenced the price perception, particularly among those who already own scanners, especially if they purchased them recently. this information was gathered to assess potential differences in behavior and evaluations of straumann's scanner value proposition. hence, the purpose of this data analysis is to provide new insights when examining purchase behavior and value propositions. owners only ios owner prospects: installed brands considering only the prospects intending to make a purchase, it is interesting to evaluate purchasing behavior and the assessment of straumann's value proposition based on the brands already owned. it was found a strong presence of medit in france and a significant presence of align technology in spain: these are two factors to be considered. it is also noteworthy that 3shape is more prevalent among the younger audience. given the number of cases, this analysis is not an evaluation of the installed base of equipment but aims to identify those who own specific brands to see if they have different purchasing intentions and if they evaluate straumann's value proposition differently compared to those using other brands. 16 what is the brand of your intraoral scanner? fr it es 27% 27% 23% 22% 15% 24% 28% 13% 16% 5% 11% 31% 8%

size and their digitization level increase. this is also true for labs performing a higher-than-average number of ortho cases with aligners. currently, spain is the country with the lowest penetration of ios but with higher growth rates and in full digitalization process. labo the laboratories state that they are approached by dentists with a certain frequency. a frequent approach is considered to be 'monthly' to 'daily'. although the frequency of approach is fairly homogeneous between countries, spain and france show a higher-than- average overall frequency of 'monthly/weekly/daily'. base: 594

respectively). itero is quoted more than average among more recently open labs (25%) and among labs receiving a high share of scan files (22%). less than average among labs performing a high share of prosthetic complex cases (12%). medit is quoted more than average among labs receiving a lower share of scan files (23%). dentsply sirona is quoted more than average among labs receiving scan files from more than half of clients (20%). labo recommendation is very high: on an overall basis, at least 90% of the laboratories approached by dentists recommend a brand. 3shape is the most recommended brand in spain and italy, while itero is most recommended in the uk. carestream has adopted a very widespread distribution and commercial strategy, which explains the high number of recommendations in italy (achieving a significantly higher penetration than in the other analysed countries). diverse recommended brands across the surveyed countries: 3shape is most quoted, itero is main follower. why do you recommend the mentioned ios brand? (multiple choice) scanner performance and clinic / lab integration are the most quoted reasons. brand reputation is quoted more often among bigger sized labs (62%) and those performing ortho cases with invisible aligners (58%). the latter also quote community more often than average (20%). integration is quoted more often by labs serving a higher number of practices (60%). service / post sales

more than average by bigger sized labs (73%) and so is for dentsply sirona (52%). again, 3shape is quoted more than average by labs equipped with a milling unit (62%) and 3d printer (60%). itero (52%) and medit (35%) are more often quoted among recently open labs. exocad users do show higher than average quotes for itero (46%). dentsply sirona is more than average quoted by labs receiving scan

relationship between the brand of the ios from which the scan is received and the recommendation of the ios brand has been investigated. the results show that 3shape has the highest relationship between the brand from which the labs receive the scanner and the recommendation. it is also true that 3shape, due to its popularity and seniority in the ios market, has a high frequency of recommendation even in labs receiving scans from other brands. in fact, it is always cited as the second brand regardless of the brand of ios from which the labs receive scans (for carestream it is the first). this also shows that 3shape's reputation is very high. base: 524 cases 3shape dentsply sirona itero medit carestream planmeca 3shape 55% 26% 29% 24% 33% 17% dentsply sirona 12% 30% 9% 5%

but it is worth to underline that in germany this penetration of milling units is historically higher due to the presence of the so called practice lab. for both uk and germany, the higher presence of dentsply sirona make the penetration of this equipment higher than average.", "also, the responses from the laboratories make understand that the increase in the productivity is felt to be an important feature that the digital technologies have to bring. chart reasons to use: milling units - europe efficiency, simplification of the procedures and overall increased quality over the traditional prosthetics procedures are among the most relevant reasons mentioned for use of a chairside milling, or a milling unit at the lab. in this case, the results of the dentists sample are not very different from those of laboratories. chart intention to buy: scanners/milling units - europe its interesting to note that the more mature technical market also shows a lower percentage of intention to by a scanner/milling unit than the dental practices. and again, when it comes to the evaluation of this indicator by country, germany shows the lowest percentages of intention to buy. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 33 with regard to the clinical sample, the countries showing the highest percentages of intention to buy are italy and spain, while among the laboratories, the countries are italy and france. among the most relevant reasons for not buying a scanner/milling unit, there are the lack of need, therefore it is not felt necessary, so it may be a good point for future commercial actions by the companies involved in this segment, and the excessive cost, together with the fact that a good portion of respondents still feel the traditional method to be the most preferred one. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 34 customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics the analysis of the overall scores of the customer satisfaction highlighted the relatively lower scores given by the sample of dental practices in comparison to the results showed by the dental laboratories. although the quality seems to be unquestionable, the same item accuracy and quality of the restorations showed an average of 7,8 in the sample of dental practices, while among laboratories it showed a score of 8,3 and for both it was the highest score among all investigated items. the other items to be the most satisfactory for both samples, were handiness/ease of use and wide range of materials available, which somehow match the needs expressed by both samples in the analysis of the most important reasons to use. reliability completes the list of the most relevant items that received the highest satisfaction scores, while, on the bottom side there is the price area, with the items overall running costs and cost of sw updates, which received among the lowest scores. the correlation analysis will explain which items are more relevant in the assessment of the overall satisfaction and if there are critical items to be monitored closely. chart customer satisfaction: bivariate correlation analysis: weight of items on the overall satisfaction europe its interesting to note that no item related to the assistance and support has been mentioned among the most satisfactory items. given the high technology content of this specific product segment, the support from the company becomes crucial and the multiple correlation analysis highlighted the importance of some items - related to the support and assistance from the manufacturer whose satisfaction score was not ranked among the highest ones. overall running cost, which resulted to be a key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 35 rather unsatisfactory item, looks to be more important to the dental practices, in the assessment of the overall satisfaction, than to the laboratories. chart customer satisfaction: bivariate correlation analysis map - europe in the lower right side of the maps there are the items whose satisfaction was not high, but whose weight on the overall satisfaction has to be considered higher than average, thus representing, from an overall point of view, key factor of success. in the sample of dental practices, the analysis highlighted the support and the assistance from the manufacturer, along with the running costs, to be critical in the assessment of the overall satisfaction. the sample of dental laboratories highlighted, other than the assistance in case of repair, a clear need for sw updates and flexibility from the manufacturer to meet the needs of their customers (laboratories). if the analysis is performed on the single manufacturers, the key factors of success become weak items, because their importance is high, but their satisfaction score is lower than average and all most relevant items mentioned for the overall analysis are present as weak items in the analysis by brand. on the laboratory side, its worth to highlight the weaknesses related to the service and support area for sirona, the running costs (overall and sw updates) and flexibility for amann girrbach and, in general, a lack of satisfaction in the area of assistance and support. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 36 chart customer satisfaction, factor analysis - europe the factor analysis (4 factors) performed on the customer satisfaction items highlighted, as happened with the recommendation, almost the same items. management costs and compatibility were exactly the same, while the first two were slightly different. in the clinical sample the quality of the product is joint to the quality of the service, thus making just one factor product and service quality, while in the sample of dental laboratories the product quality is alone and the service is part of a different factor focused on the area of support and assistance. the technical assistance and support make the difference: for the dental practices, they belong to the first factor, while for the laboratory they belong to the second one. chart customer satisfaction, multiple regression analysis - europe this analysis takes care of assessing how much the single factors affect the overall satisfaction. as previously seen in the factor analysis, the technical assistance and support look to be important, because in the sample of dental practices the first factor, which includes those items, weights far more than the other ones (43%), while in the sample of dental laboratories is the second factor again, including those factors the most important one, with 33% of weight on the overall satisfaction. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 37 also, its worth to underline the relative higher importance of the cost items for the dental practices, given that the factor management costs weights 26% vs 18% for the dental laboratories. conclusions the brand awareness highlighted a not negligible influence by the digital technologies in general, especially with regard to the dental practices, where some brands may have seen their performance affected by market segments like digital x-ray and digital guided surgery for dental implants. sirona resulted to be by far the brand with the most relevant performance, especially among dental practices. as for the dental laboratories, the performance of sirona faces the presence of other brands like 3shape, dental wings, zirkonzahn and amann girrbach. the factor analysis highlighted a possible positioning of the mentioned brands according to two main factors, the nearness and the reputation possibly affecting the recommendation. while on the sample of dental practices the positioning resulted to be rather affected by the performance of sirona, whose position was not distinctive, the analysis performed on the dental laboratories highlighted kavo positioning to be more related to the nearness, and so was for bego, while other brands like ivoclar vivadent, 3shape and zirkonzahn have been more linked to the reputation. the use of the different equipment is more widespread among the dental laboratories, whose penetration resulted to be far higher than the dental practices. the fact that the technical market may be considered rather more mature than the clinical one, is proved by the intention to buy digital equipment in the future, whose value was just 12% versus 21% of the dental practices. the brand numeric distribution highlighted a higher number of competitors present in the technical segment than the clinical one, and the distribution highlighted the same brands mentioned in the awareness analysis. the most important reasons to use mentioned by the respondents were related to ease of use, comfort, quality and efficiency, other than the possibility offered by this kind of technology to shorten the production workflow and increase the productivity, but the multivariate analysis performed on the satisfaction highlighted some critical items related to the service and support from the manufacturers, which didnt receive fully satisfactory scores, but whose importance in the assessment of
