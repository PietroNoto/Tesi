labs receiving intra-oral scan files if never, why? smaller labs bigger labs when the impact of ios scans on the lab business is positive, labs approach doctors more frequently. labs approaching dentists for the practice digitization is quite high, lower than average in the mediterranean countries. in spain, the development of digital technologies in the dental sector has accelerated significantly in the last two years, which is the reason why the percentage of laboratories approaching studies on this subject is high. the reason for not recommending varies with the size of the laboratories: small laboratories do not recommend because they do not feel adequate, while large laboratories, which are the most digitalised ones, are also the ones that can spend less time on this activity. bigger labs higher than average for a frequent approach (46% often). the frequency of the approaches to dentists is higher as the lab overall business trend is positive (43% often). labo base: 524 cases cases 123 108 101 91 101 full digital workflow 21 main arguments to convince doctors about digitization when discussing with your doctors about starting/furthering the digitization process of their practice with an intra-oral scanner, what argumentation do you use to convince them? - top 3 ranking the owner of the lab pays more attention to the workflow simplification (54%) and the improved perception of the practice (42%). lab managers talk more about the reduced number of remakes (41%). accuracy of the scan files is more often used by big sized labs (59%). improvement of the workflow is also more often quoted by respondents whose lab experienced an overall increase of their business (51%). technical, procedural and patients experience arguments are used the most. labo in italy, the proposed topics are significantly different from those of the rest of the countries. simplification of the workflow, improvement of the patient experience and of the perception of the practice among patients emerge as relevant, while the impact of the accuracy of the scans is low. some topics are very often listed in the top three as most relevant, resulting in better ranking averages. the items at the top right of the map, together with the item simplification of workflow suggest that there is a desire to improve the synergy between the practice and the laboratory and the management of the communication flow between them. base: 409 cases seldom and often quotes 22 frequency of doctors approaching labs about ios recommendation how often do you get approached by doctors about your recommendation on intra-oral scanner? 30% of dental labs are approached at least monthly. frequency of recommendation increases as the labs size and their digitization level increase. this is also true for labs performing a higher-than-average number of ortho cases with aligners. currently, spain is the country with the lowest penetration of ios but with higher growth rates and in full digitalization process. labo the laboratories state that they are approached by dentists with a certain frequency. a frequent approach is considered to be 'monthly' to 'daily'. although the frequency of approach is fairly homogeneous between countries, spain and france show a higher-than- average overall frequency of 'monthly/weekly/daily'. base: 594 cases cases 137 114 125 113 105 23 recommended intraoral scanner brands when asked by the clinician, do you recommend a specific intra-oral scanner brand? which intra-oral scanner brand do you recommend most often? 3shape is quoted more than average among big sized labs (49%), by the lab owners (39%), less recently open structures and those stating the business has decreased (40% and 46% respectively). itero is quoted more than average among more recently open labs (25%) and among labs receiving a high share of scan files (22%). less than average among labs performing a high share of prosthetic complex cases (12%). medit is quoted more than average among labs receiving a lower share of scan files (23%). dentsply sirona is quoted more than average among labs receiving scan files from more than half of clients (20%). labo recommendation is very high: on an overall basis, at least 90% of the laboratories approached by dentists recommend a brand. 3shape is the most recommended brand in spain and italy, while itero is most recommended in the uk. carestream has adopted a very widespread distribution and commercial strategy, which explains the high number of recommendations in italy (achieving a significantly higher penetration than in the other analysed countries). diverse recommended brands across the surveyed countries: 3shape is most quoted, itero is main follower. why do you recommend the mentioned ios brand? (multiple choice) scanner performance and clinic / lab integration are the most quoted reasons. brand reputation is quoted more often among bigger sized labs (62%) and those performing ortho cases with invisible aligners (58%). the latter also quote community more often than average (20%). integration is quoted more often by labs serving a higher number of practices (60%). service / post sales support is more often quoted by labs receiving a higher share of scan files (46%). base: 440 cases intraoral scanners brands when receiving scan files what are the top 3 brands of the intra-oral scanners that you receive files from? 24 3shape is top quoted brand for ios scan files received. carestream is very widespread in italy compared to the average in the other countries. 3shape is quoted more than average by bigger sized labs (73%) and so is for dentsply sirona (52%). again, 3shape is quoted more than average by labs equipped with a milling unit (62%) and 3d printer (60%). itero (52%) and medit (35%) are more often quoted among recently open labs. exocad users do show higher than average quotes for itero (46%). dentsply sirona is more than average quoted by labs receiving scan files from more than 50% of their clients (62%). full digital workflow labo base: 524 cases intraoral scanners brands: recommendation vs scan files reception when asked by the clinician, which intra-oral scanner brand do you recommend most often? what are the top 3 brands of the intra-oral scanners that you receive files from? 25 full digital workflow labo at overall level, a possible relationship between the brand of the ios from which the scan is received and the recommendation of the ios brand has been investigated. the results show that 3shape has the highest relationship between the brand from which the labs receive the scanner and the recommendation. it is also true that 3shape, due to its popularity and seniority in the ios market, has a high frequency of recommendation even in labs receiving scans from other brands. in fact, it is always cited as the second brand regardless of the brand of ios from which the labs receive scans (for carestream it is the first). this also shows that 3shape's reputation is very high. base: 524 cases 3shape dentsply sirona itero medit carestream planmeca 3shape 55% 26% 29% 24% 33% 17% dentsply sirona 12% 30% 9% 5% 7% 13% itero 13% 12% 37% 20% 16% 21% medit 8% 12% 8% 38% 8% 2% carestream 7% 9% 5% 8% 32% 8% planmeca 2% 7% 7% 2% 1% 35% ios brand: received files ios brand: recommendation other digital workflow components penetration chairside milling system penetration do you have a chairside milling system in your dental practice?

clinic and laboratories markets evaluated with regard to the new digital technologies, such as intraoral scanners, chairside milling (clinical), table top scanners, in lab milling and 3d printing (laboratories). with the amount of 1.000 dental practices interviewed; the sample and its results fully represent the population of the european dental practices. with a confidence level of 95% the maximum error (confidence interval) is +/- 3,5%. the data was processed using excel, spss, statistica. due to the objectives of knowledge and the types of questions, the data was processed: contingency tables significance test glossary the confidence level indicates the reliability level of the research. for example, a confidence level equal to 95% means that the phenomenon pointed out by the research is correct for the 95% of the cases. the confidence interval indicates how much the research data diverge from reality. as the sample results, even if representative, cannot be perfectly correspondent to those obtainable interviewing the entire population, each research has an approximation degree which represents the maximum error of the research. for example, a confidence interval of 3% indicates that if the research phenomenon is equal to 60%, the result can change, in comparison with reality, of an extra 3% or a minus 3% and in this way it is included between 63%

(a). the weight of the surveyed countries regarding the dental practices is shown at (b). the overall results (only the overall ones) must be representative of the total universe (all countries investigated) which the sample refers to, as if we were to interview the whole universe. if we assume that the number of dental practices is a reliable indication of the weight of a given country, we need to make sure that each countrys sample weights as much as the number of the surgeries for that country, out of the total evaluated countries. in this case, since the natural weight of the interviews in each country is different from the weight of the parameter considered, we have to apply a multiplying factor (it can be more or less than 1) to the number of performed interviews in each country, so that, only for the overall results, the weighted interviews are consistent with the parameter used. the resulting number of weighted interviews is then shown at (c). it is important to

where, however, those technologies are less widespread, in particular the chairside milling, with an intention to buy which is double the average. the target focus is between 46 and 55 years old, the

for more than 20 years. despite there is a direct correlation between the size and the intention to buy, the big sized practice with at least 3-4 chairs and several consultants is more oriented towards the purchase of a scanner and far less to the chairside milling, which seems to be more interesting to a mid-sized practice with 2-3 chairs, which in the future may recur to the partnership with an internal technician. the specialized practices seem to be more oriented to make the investment (47% specialized practices vs 25% general ones), in specific prosthetics and implant dentistry

what should a cad-cam technology manufacturer offer to enhance / improve the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in your clinic? aggregated basis of response 32 random sample the analysis on the investment attitude, some interesting points emerge, because among those declaring an interest to the purchase, the attention to the economical aspects greatly reduces, while increases that on support and training (65% versus 26% of the rejectors) and a higher demand for assistance in practice from those thinking about a possible purchase (46% vs 18%). this is even more evident among those interested in the purchase of a chairside milling. also, they are more interested in the marketing support (almost double versus the ones interested in the purchase of the scanner only) to foster the demand from the patients. as for the economical matters, those interested in the chairside milling dont ask for a price reduction, but easier financial conditions or pay per use options. base: 135

random sample the comparison between unaided awareness and top of mind highlights relevant differences in the ability of a brand to represent its own product family, which is shown by the ratio called prominence. a higher prominence value means a higher ability to represent the analysed product family: this in fact is the ratio between the first mentioned brand top of mind and the unaided awareness. the sum of unaided awareness responses represents the average number of brands mentioned by each interviewees: in this case the sum of percentages is 145%, that means the interviewees have mentioned about 1,5 brands. its interesting to note that about 50% of the interviewees did not mention any brand, which is a clear sign of this market being a rather immature one, almost a niche.

technique that helps to identify and measure the influence of the independent variables (in this case, current users) on the dependent one (in this case, the recommendation). the bivariate correlation analysis has been used to quantify the relation between the score on the single items and the rating on the recommendation. therefore, it is possible to retrieve a hierarchy of importance from the individual statements and to display them in a chart, and then on a map. the vertical axis always shows the scores that the different items have received, on average, while the horizontal axis shows their influence on the recommendation. in this way, its obtained an estimated importance of each item proposed to the interviewees, which results a bit different from the score explicitly stated. the analysis of the weight of each of the statements, and not only of the declared importance, allows for some interesting considerations. the items have a different meaning according to the point of view with which they are considered: statistical note recommendation related to the whole market here we can highlight some prerequisites (upper-right corner of the map, where almost all the competitors perform positively), some key factors of success (lower-right corner of the map, where companies are not always able to meet the expectations with regard to strategic issues), and indifference areas (lower-left side of the map) which become waste/not efficient areas when a company decides to invest in those items belonging to the upper-left side of the map, since they show a lower weight on the recommendation. recommendation related to a specific company/product here the scheme is the same, but we can highlight the strength points in the upper-right side of the map, which can determine inefficiency or indifference if placed in the left side of the map. in the lower-right we can note an improvement area, where we can find the weak points of a certain company (higher than average item

the practices with an improved management, the offer of prostheses produced through scanner only and chairside milling is higher compared to the practices with a more traditional management: respectively the sample stands at 11% and 7%. the trend to own an intraoral scanner and a chairside milling unit is a feature of practices with better performances, and respectively 21% and 11% of practices in the last year have placed more than 50 implants. the chairside milling is more present among surgeries with more than 3 chairs (9%); the same trend features those having only the

satisfaction performance differs from the overall mean (vertical axis). the significant differences from the mean are marked with a red circle, so that it is possible to focus on the most interesting topics. with this regard, it is worth to note the higher than average performance of amann girrbach and 3shape regarding the factor performance, while it is significant the below average performance of 3shape in the factor operating costs. 99 overall satisfaction multiple regression analysis customer satisfaction: multiple regression analysis 101 in order to complete the factor analysis, it is important to also assess the weight of these factors on the overall satisfaction to understand if an improvement in one of them can also improve the satisfaction of a particular brand. therefore, these factors are used as a basis for a further analysis, called multiple regression analysis that aims to understand how they explain the overall satisfaction. the figure \"r2 = 0,878\" means that more than 80% of the total satisfaction is explained and it is based on the given factors, which is a remarkable result. the overall model shows that the weight of the performance factor is slightly less than 50%, therefore the importance of this factor is relevant. the second factor is the support, then operating costs shows the lowest weight. it is interesting to look at the following slides, when the same analysis is carried out on the single brands. overall satisfaction (r2=0,878) 46% 25% performance operating costs 29% support customer satisfaction: multiple regression analysis 102 apart from open technologies, showing a relevant weight for the factor performance, it looks like the regression models of the other investigated brands is predominantly driven by the operating costs, meaning that this factor highly affects the overall satisfaction of amann girrbach and 3shape, while for open technologies it has a marginal weight. as a matter of fact, for amman girrbach and 3shape, the items included in this factor emerged as key items to improve the overall satisfaction in the correlation analysis and the factor analysis highlighted the need to improve this topic. especially in the case of 3shape, looking back at its satisfaction scores in the factor analysis, it now looks more important strategically the weaker performance on the operating costs factor, more than the strong results on the performance factor. fixed prosthesis in ceramics or composite production fixed prosthesis in ceramics or composite how many elements for fixed prosthesis (in metal ceramics, all

europe both samples agreed on the most relevant change brought by 3d printing in dentistry would be the increase in the kinds of materials available and of the digital procedures available. in comparison to the overall results there are no relevant differences among the evaluated countries. the reduction in the price of the restorations is not seen to be a major change. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 24 macro trends / scenario conclusions the penetration of the digital technologies is higher among the dental technicians than among the dental practices, especially in the use of digital equipment. with specific regard to the dentists, the most used way to provide digital restorations is to send impressions to a third party to produce the digital restorations. however, according to the opinion of all respondents, the digital technologies will have a relevant role in the future of prosthetics, despite some grade of discomfort, mostly due to the lack of information and training. by looking at the most relevant features required by a digital technology provider, the (economic) convenience appears to be one of the most important factors to work on, in order to speed up the propagation of the new technologies. the uk and germany represent two opposite situations, where uk shows a lower than average penetration in the use of digital technologies and germany shows a rather higher than average percentage. however, german respondents seem to be rather conservative, as both, dentists and technicians show higher penetration rates, but still are the respondents who feel more uncomfortable with the technology. it is interesting to evaluate the position of spain, italy and france as countries that they firmly believe the digital technologies are the future of prosthetics and foresee a future tightening of the relationship with the industry due to the increase in the demand for case specific manufactured products. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 25 brand awareness and positioning the analysis on digital technologies went deeper with the investigation of the main brands of this segment. in specific, the brand awareness focused on the most quoted brands. the unaided awareness has shown that, among dental practices, there are a few well-known brands whose performance is very high. on the other hand, when considering the technical market, the brands mentioned by the respondents are several, to testify that the digital technologies in the laboratory are a more mature market. chart unaided brand awareness- europe sirona and 3m are the brands to be mentioned among the most relevant ones in both samples, in particular, the former is among the top three brands in both samples. the laboratory market shows several brands whose longtime presence in the laboratory market is unquestionable, and the rather low number of brands mentioned by the clinical sample testifies the relatively young business. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 26 chart brand positioning, items average scores - europe when it comes to consider the brand positioning, it must be said that the relative scores quoted by both samples are rather consistent, showing almost the same behavior. both samples gave lower than average scores for the item too expensive, good price/quality ratio and affordable, while the performance of other items related to the brand reputation and reliability received higher scores. when considering the brands individually, in the clinical market, while sirona is rather on average, its interesting to note that kavo performed better than the competitors with regard to affordability and customer service oriented, while 3m is more than other brands associated with too expensive and worldwide renowned. on the technical side, it is worth to mention bego, which is higher than average in trustworthy, but far below for too expensive, and sirona, whose performance on affordability and customer service oriented, is not on par with the other brands. zirkonzahn showed higher scores for recommendation and innovation, while amann girrbach is higher than average in good price quality ratio. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary -

correlation analysis 52 items score items weight on recommendation with the bivariate correlation analysis we try to understand how much the factors seen in the factor analysis influence the recommendation, by analysing the different weight that the single items composing the factors have on the recommendation. bivariate correlation analysis the bivariate correlation analysis is a technique that helps to identify and measure the influence of the independent variables (in this case, each brand positioning item) on the dependent one (in this case, the recommendation). the bivariate correlation analysis has been used to quantify the relation between the score on the single factors and the rating on the recommendation how much are worth the single items on the recommendation? brand image vs recommendation - correlation analysis map 53 the map is the visual results of the two different charts seen in the previous slide. on the horizontal axis there is the weight on the recommendation of each item, and on the vertical one theres the rating of each item. considering rather new and immature markets, its not rare to see the items related to the pricing in general not to be relevant in the recommendation process.

europe vs. breakdown per country key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 14 the sample is rather split evenly between those feeling the type of restorations will not change, and those thinking that there will be a change. the major differences come from germany and uk, where there are the major part of respondents stating there will be no change. it looks like the major changes brought by the digital technologies are mostly related to the material used (more use of zirconia and cocr instead of alloys) and the fact that there may be a higher production of fixed prosthetics instead of removable one. required features from digital technology providers chart what dentists expect from a digital technology provider, in order to improve and enhance the way they perform restorations and prosthetics - europe a manufacturer will clearly need to give support to digital technology users, in terms of training and information and in terms of improvement in the performance. an interesting assumption may be that the unfamiliarity is the driver making dentists to ask for training and information for either start using digital technologies or to use them in a better and more effective way. at second place, the statements about convenience reflect the desire to receive from the manufacturers services and/or products that can make their work easier, more affordable and more productive. key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary -
