The text also touches upon the concept of \"top of mind\" and its relationship with brands.","11":" The total number of restorations produced by digital flow prost providers for prosthesis on implants is 1,5 out of 3,1 elements produced with digital workflow, which equals to 47.7% of the elements produced for prosthesis on implants. Among digital technology users, the most used way to provide digital restorations is to send impressions in full outsourcing to partner-labs or manufacturers\/milling centers, with a 41% of users. The percentage of surgeries for digital prosthesis providers offering indirect restorations produced with digital technologies is 37% for practices with up to 50 patients per week and 52% for practices with 50+ patients per week.","12":" The question asks about the relevance of certain items in relation to overall satisfaction. The answer explains that all such items are included in the analysis, indicating that they are considered significant in this context. The answer also mentions the lowest weight, which suggests that weight is being taken into account, and that the analysis considers the cost of sw updates and compatibility with other brands. The answer also mentions the correlation analysis and the critical area, implying that these concepts are relevant in this context. Overall, the answer seems to suggest that the analysis is focused on identifying items that contribute to overall satisfaction, and that it takes into account various factors such as weight, cost, and compatibility.","13":" Based on the survey results, less than 2% of cad-cam users in Brazil have a chairside.","14":"\nThe survey shows that in 2016, 1.018 cases were sold as chairside cad-cam milling units, with a potential interest of 70 cases for chairside cad-cam milling units, being 90% for sirona and 10% for cerec. The percentage of cases interested in evaluating sirona and cerec is 16% and 3%, respectively, with a higher percentage for sirona when cerec was mentioned. The survey does not provide a percentage for the mentioned brands.","15":" France and Spain have the highest percentage of weight of optical impressions out of the total impressions taken in a practice, with 69.2% and 66.5%, respectively. Germany has the lowest percentage at 49.5%.

This information can be found in Document 2.","18":" The frequency of approaches to dentists regarding intraoral scanners is higher than the percentage of clients that mentioned a certain brand, which indicates that there is a higher interest in this technology than actual purchases. This suggests that some dentists may still be hesitant or uncertain about the benefits and cost-effectiveness of intraoral scanners, despite their growing popularity. However, the percentage of clients mentioning specific brands is still relatively low, indicating that the market for intraoral scanners is still in its early stages of adoption. The percentage of clients mentioning a brand is higher for larger dental practices, which may suggest that these practices are more likely to invest in advanced technology. The percentage of clients mentioning a brand is also higher for practices that have already purchased an intraoral scanner, indicating that these practices are satisfied with their investment. The percentage of clients mentioning a brand is higher for practices that have already purchased an intraoral scanner, indicating that these practices are satisfied with their investment.","19":" 22% of Spanish dental laboratories that do not currently provide dental restorations digitally plan to start providing fixed prosthesis elements produced with digital technologies in the next year, according to the Key-Stone Omnivision Digital Europe 2015 report.","20":" The main reason for digital equipment users in Germany to use their in-lab milling scanner and base is the daily practice made easier and the quality of the restorations, according to brand numeric distribution.","21":" In Italy, partner laboratories for dentists contribute around 53% to the overall production of dental treatments, according to a sample segmentation study conducted in 2021 with 600 cases. However, it should be noted that the size of dental labs in Italy has slightly increased in recent years, which may affect overall production, and further analysis over the next years will provide insight into whether this issue is related to a possible structural reorganization of dental labs in Italy, potentially leading to market concentration.","22":" The penetration of dental scanners is higher in dental laboratories compared to dental practices, with 84% of laboratory samples using scanners compared to 20% of dental practice samples. This difference may be due to the fact that dental laboratories use scanners for both sending outside scan files and using them with in-lab milling centers, while dental practices may only use them for taking digital impressions chairside.","23":" According to the chart in Document 1, out of the total scanner users (who send their scan files outside for milling), 20% (11% who have an in-lab milling at the laboratory and 10% who send their models outside for milling) also send their models outside for milling to a manufacturer\/milling center. Therefore, the percentage of European partner lab users who also send their models or scan files to a manufacturer\/milling center is 20%.","24":" What is the percentage of elements used in the production of definitive elements in the left chart and the right chart, and how does it relate to the breakdown of produced elements and the inclusion of waxes in the process?","25":" In terms of reputation, Bego falls behind some other brands in affordability and customer service orientation, but is higher than average in trustworthiness.","26":" On average, laboratories produce 7.9 composite elements for fixed prosthesis in a week.","27":" What percentage of prosthetic elements produced with digital workflow in-house in Italy are made with optical impressions?\n\nBased on Document 3, we can see that the question specifically asks about prosthetic elements produced with digital workflow only. However, none of the provided contexts (Documents 0, 1, and 2) mention optical impressions in relation to digital workflow. Therefore, we cannot determine the percentage of prosthetic elements produced with digital workflow in-house in Italy using optical impressions.
