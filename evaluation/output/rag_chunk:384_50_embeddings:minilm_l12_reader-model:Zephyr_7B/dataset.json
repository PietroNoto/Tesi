considering the digital prosthesis providers, 11% of the overall digital prosthesis production is produced with a chairside milling (about 5% in the whole market). by aggregating the information by channel we can say that among digital prosthesis providers, 79% of production is made by partner lab (which becomes 34% on the whole sample) and 10% by manufacturers (which becomes 4% on the whole sample). considering the technologies, 10% of the production is made by scans and 79% by impressions sent outside in full outsourcing mode. considering the whole market (including the non-providers of digital prosthesis), 4% of production is made of scans and 91% by traditional impressions. shares on total sample chairside milling: 5", "by italy (9%) and france (7%). 5% only of uk practices state to have at least a technician working at the practice. this value should be considered as an indication only as the number of cases is very low, so is not statistically relevant. as an indication, the
