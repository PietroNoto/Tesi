Dentsply Sirona also has significant penetration, but 3shape leads in terms of scan file reception. Itero is noted for its popularity among more recently established labs.","1":"A future competitor to Sirona in CAD-CAM equipment could be Dentsply Sirona, which is already gaining recognition in the market. Other emerging brands like Zirkonzahn and Dental Wings are also potential competitors. The competitive landscape suggests that various companies may challenge Sirona's position as technology adoption increases.","2":"Dentsply Sirona has the highest ratio between total digital awareness and unaided awareness, followed by 3Shape and Carestream. This indicates its strong presence and recognition in the market.","3":"In Spain, 62.8% of indirect restorations are produced using digital workflow. The remaining 37.2% are produced with traditional techniques. This data reflects the overall production share of indirect restorations in dental practices.","4":"The mean satisfaction score for all CAD-CAM brands in dental labs is 8.1. This reflects an increase from the previous average of 7.8 in 2015. The data is based on 274 cases from brand owners.","5":"I don't know.","6":"Spanish dental labs are approached by doctors about their recommendations on intra-oral scanners with a frequency that can range from monthly to daily. Approximately 30% of dental labs report being approached at least monthly, and this frequency tends to increase with the size and digitization level of the labs. Overall, the development of digital technologies in Spain has led to a higher frequency of such approaches in recent years.","7":"The main reasons dental professionals are not willing to purchase an intra-oral scanner within 2 years are the high cost and a perceived lack of need for the technology. Additionally, many prefer traditional methods over digital alternatives. Concerns about retirement or closing their practice also play a significant role in their decision-making.","8":"The leading brand of 3D printing unit in Spain is Formlabs, which holds a significant market share. It is followed by 3D Systems. The data indicates that Formlabs leads by a wide margin compared to its competitors.","9":"The most recommended iOS brand in dental labs across Europe is 3shape, particularly noted for its popularity in Spain and Italy. In the UK, Itero is the most favored brand. Other notable mentions include Dentsply Sirona and Carestream, which have significant recommendations in various countries.","10":"Dentsply Sirona has the highest ratio between spontaneous and total notoriety in the digital equipment segment in Spain. It is the most mentioned brand and shows significant awareness among consumers. 3shape also has considerable recognition but does not surpass Dentsply Sirona's prominence.","11":"The total number of restorations produced by digital flow prosthesis providers is not explicitly stated in the retrieved context. However, it mentions that on average, digital prosthesis providers produce about 3.3 indirect restorations per week. To find the total, one would need the number of providers and the time frame considered, which is not provided.","12":"The lowest weight on overall satisfaction for 3Shape is associated with items like start-up training, frequency of software updates, and technical assistance. These items have been identified as having lower satisfaction rates and are critical areas for improvement. Overall, the costs do not significantly impact the assessment of overall satisfaction.","13":"Less than 2% of dental practices in Brazil have a chairside unit. This indicates a very low penetration of chairside CAD-CAM technology in the country.","14":"The most common in-house CAD\/CAM milling unit is from the brand Dentsply Sirona. The specific year of purchase is not provided in the available information.","15":"The country with the highest percentage of weight of optical impressions out of the total impressions taken in a practice is France, with a percentage of 69.2%.

Nearly 50% of dentists in Spain consider price sensitivity a significant obstacle, reflecting deeper societal biases. Additionally, the perception of various issues also differs notably from other countries like France and Italy.","17":"31% of laboratories with three or more technicians plan to start providing fixed prosthetics using digital technologies within the next year. This represents an increase in interest compared to previous years. The trend reflects a broader acceptance of digital technologies in the sector.","18":"The penetration of dental scanners in European dental laboratories is reported to be 84%. This indicates a high adoption rate of scanning technology among the laboratories surveyed. In contrast, dental practices show a significantly lower penetration of intraoral scanners at 20%.","19":"18% of Spanish laboratories that do not currently provide dental restorations plan to start offering fixed prosthesis elements produced with digital technologies in the next year. This percentage increases to 31% among laboratories with three or more technicians.","20":"The main reasons for digital equipment users in Germany to use their in-lab milling scanner and base are to make daily practice easier and to improve the quality of restorations. Additionally, users also appreciate the flexibility offered by a broader range of procedures and the convenience of these technologies.","21":"In Italy, 18.5% of dental production is made by partner laboratories for dentists.","22":"The penetration of dental scanners in the sample of dental laboratories is notably high, with the majority of labs equipped with desktop scanners.
