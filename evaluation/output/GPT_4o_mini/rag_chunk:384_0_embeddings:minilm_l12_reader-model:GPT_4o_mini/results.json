purchasing behavior perception. drivers of choice the most important factors in choosing an intraoral scanner include high reading accuracy, scan resolution, and affordable price. in france, economic accessibility is less of a priority, but product training is highly valued. in spain, affordability and flexible scanning are crucial, while wireless charging is appreciated in both italy and france. compatibility with invisalign: concerns and priorities compatibility with invisalign has emerged as a significant concern in focus groups. among the 15% who consider compatibility with aligners important, two-thirds specifically value compatibility with invisalign, indicating that 60% of those who view \"compatibility with clear aligners\" as important see it as a major issue. this

Align Technology holds a top position in Spain.","1":"A future competitor to Sirona in CAD-CAM equipment is imes-icore, which focuses on the production of milling units. Other notable competitors include Roland, Amann Girrbach, and Zirkonzahn, which also produce CAD-CAM systems and consumables. The market is increasingly competitive with specialized players improving their penetration.","2":"The brand with the highest ratio between total digital awareness and unaided awareness is 3shape. Although it does not have the highest total awareness value, it excels in this specific ratio. Other brands like Zirkonzahn and Dentsply Sirona have higher total awareness but are mentioned less frequently in a spontaneous context.","3":"In Spain, approximately 37.2% of indirect restorations are produced using a digital workflow. The remaining 62.8% are produced with traditional techniques. This indicates a significant reliance on conventional methods despite the adoption of digital technologies.","4":"The mean satisfaction score for all CAD-CAM brands in dental labs is approximately 6.3. This score reflects a general trend of decreased satisfaction compared to previous analyses. It is important to note that specific brand scores may vary significantly within this average.","5":"The net promoter score (NPS) in Italy in 2018 was 8.2, reflecting a significant improvement compared to previous years. This score indicates a positive increase in the percentage of advocates and a decrease in detractors. Overall, the NPS demonstrated a considerable rise from 3% to 31% since 2015.","6":"Spanish dental labs often get approached by doctors regarding their recommendations on intra-oral scanners, especially when business trends are positive. About 43% of labs report approaching dentists frequently, with larger labs being more proactive in these discussions. The increasing digitization in the dental sector has led to a higher frequency of these interactions.","7":"Dental professionals are primarily reluctant to purchase an intra-oral scanner within the next two years due to concerns about the high costs associated with the technology. Additionally, many dentists express a lack of need for the scanner and a preference for traditional methods of obtaining impressions. Some are also nearing retirement, which leads to a reduced interest in investing in new equipment.","8":"Formlabs is the leader by a wide margin in the 3D printing market in Spain. It consistently ranks at the top in penetration among laboratories, outperforming competitors like Anycubic. The market presence of Formlabs is notably strong, especially in labs that receive a higher share of scan files from dentists.","9":"The most recommended intraoral scanner (IOS) brand in dental labs in Europe is 3Shape, which has a significant presence across various countries. Medit is also highly regarded, particularly in France and Spain, showing strong performance among recently opened labs. Dentsply Sirona and Dental Wings are other notable mentions within the top brands.","10":"The brand with the highest ratio between spontaneous and total notoriety in the digital equipment segment in Spain is 3Shape. While other brands like Dentsply Sirona have high total awareness, they are not mentioned as frequently in a spontaneous context.","11":"The total number of restorations produced by digital flow prosthesis providers amounts to approximately 185 indirect restorations. Additionally, around 37% of these restorations are created using digital workflows. The data reflects a growing trend towards digital production in dental practices.","12":"The lowest weight on overall satisfaction for 3Shape is associated with the factors of start-up training, frequency of software updates, and technical assistance in case of repair. These items are considered to be in a weaker position compared to others, which are more satisfactory to users. Overall, the cost areas do not significantly affect the overall satisfaction.","13":"Approximately 4.7% of cad-cam users in Brazil have a chairside system.

In contrast, Germany has the lowest percentage at 49.5%.","16":"Germany shows the most issues related to biases and stereotypes among the countries analyzed. The data indicates a higher prevalence of perceived biases in Germany compared to other countries. This suggests a notable impact of these issues on the perceptions and behaviors of individuals in that country.","17":"31% of laboratories with three or more technicians plan to start providing fixed prosthetics using digital technologies within the next year. This reflects a significant interest in adopting digital methods in their operations. However, some challenges remain regarding the perceived demand and investment costs.","18":"The penetration of dental scanners among European dental laboratories is significant, with 34% of laboratories providing digital restorations utilizing them. Additionally, there is a strong interest in increasing the use of intraoral scans, with 82% of surveyed labs expressing interest. This indicates a positive trend towards digitalization in the dental laboratory sector.","19":"18% of Spanish laboratories that do not currently provide dental restorations plan to start offering fixed prosthesis elements produced with digital technologies within the next year. This represents an increase from 16% in 2015. The intention to adopt digital technologies has been gradually rising among these laboratories.","20":"The main reasons for digital equipment users in Germany to use their in-lab milling scanner and base are to make daily practice easier and to improve the quality of restorations. Additionally, users appreciate the flexibility and convenience offered by these technologies. Overall, these factors contribute to a more efficient workflow in dental laboratories.","21":"In Italy, 18.5% of dental production is made by partner laboratories for dentists.","22":"The penetration of dental scanners among dental laboratories is reported to be 34%. This indicates a notable adoption of digital technology within the laboratory sector. However, the use of intraoral scanners may vary, as many laboratories do not recommend them due to their size and digital readiness.","23":"48% of European partner lab users also send their models or scan files to a manufacturer\/milling center. Additionally, 11% of them have in-lab milling capabilities.","24":"The percentage of elements made with optical impressions in Italy is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the average weight of optical impressions out of the total impressions produced is around 62.9%. Specific data for Italy is not available, so the exact percentage is unknown.","25":"The brand Bego appears to have a positive reputation, particularly in terms of reliability and trust, which are highly correlated with recommendations. However, pricing seems to be a less significant factor in its overall perception.
