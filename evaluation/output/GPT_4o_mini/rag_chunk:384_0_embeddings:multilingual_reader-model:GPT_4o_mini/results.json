Additionally, Planmeca has the potential to improve its position in the digital technologies market if it enhances its communication efforts.","2":"Dentsply Sirona has the highest ratio between total digital awareness and unaided awareness. While other brands like Carestream also perform well, Dentsply Sirona stands out in this aspect.","3":"The percentage of indirect restorations produced with digital workflow in Spain is approximately 37.2%. This reflects a trend where a significant portion of production still relies on traditional techniques. The adoption of digital technologies varies across different dental practices.","4":"The mean satisfaction score for all CAD-CAM brands in dental labs is 8.1. This score is based on a survey of 365 quotes from various users. The average has increased compared to previous years, indicating improved satisfaction levels.","5":"In 2018, the net promoter score (NPS) in Italy was reported at -6%, indicating a level of dissatisfaction among users regarding their current providers. This negative score suggests that there were more detractors than advocates in the evaluated market.","6":"Spanish dental labs are approached by doctors about their recommendation on intra-oral scanners at least monthly in about 30% of cases. The frequency of these approaches increases with the size of the laboratories and their level of digitization. Overall, Spain shows a higher-than-average frequency of doctors seeking recommendations compared to other countries.","7":"The main reasons dental professionals are not willing to purchase an intra-oral scanner within two years are the high cost and a perceived lack of need for the technology. Additionally, some professionals prefer traditional methods over digital scanning. Close proximity to retirement also influences their decision against purchasing.","8":"Formlabs is the leading brand of 3D printing units in Spain by a wide margin.

This includes various indirect restorations such as crowns, bridges, inlays, onlays, and veneers. The data suggests that approximately half of these restorations are for prosthesis on implants.","12":"The lowest weight on overall satisfaction for 3Shape is associated with items like start-up training, frequency of software updates, and technical assistance in case of repair. These items show lower satisfaction scores despite their relevance to overall satisfaction. Overall, while they are important, they do not significantly impact customer satisfaction levels.","13":"Approximately 4.7% of cad-cam users in Brazil have a chairside unit.

Additionally, 27% of those who have a positive outlook on their business intend to adopt these technologies.","20":"The main reasons for digital equipment users in Germany to utilize their in-lab milling scanner and base are the ease of daily practice and the quality of restorations. Additionally, users also appreciate the flexibility offered by a broader range of available procedures and the convenience of digital technology.","21":"Approximately 18.5% of production for dentists in Italy is made by partner laboratories. This figure reflects the contributions of partner labs in the overall production landscape for dental services.","22":"The penetration of desktop scanners in dental laboratories is 81%. This indicates a high adoption rate among labs, making them an essential part of the dental workflow. Additionally, desktop scanners have the highest penetration among CAD-CAM technologies in these settings.","23":"11% of partner lab users also send their models or scan files to a manufacturer\/milling center.
