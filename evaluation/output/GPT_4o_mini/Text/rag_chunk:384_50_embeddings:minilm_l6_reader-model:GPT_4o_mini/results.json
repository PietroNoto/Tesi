with regard to the technology users, out of the total scanner users (red circled data, respondents using a scanner to send the scan files outside for milling), in 11% of the cases they also have an in-lab milling at the laboratory, and in 10% of the cases they also send the models outside for milling (either to a manufacturer\/milling center or a partner lab). on the other hand, with regard to

the scanner technology (they use the scanner to produce scan files to be sent outside for milling) and 5% of them also have a chairside milling. on the other hand, with regard to the channel users, out of the total partner lab users (blue circled data, respondents sending their impressions or scan files to a partner lab), in 93% of the cases they send the impressions to a partner lab, in 11% of
