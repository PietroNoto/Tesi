Itero follows as a significant competitor, especially among recently opened labs. Dentsply Sirona also has a notable presence in the market.","1":"A future competitor to Sirona in CAD-CAM equipment is Dentsply Sirona, as they are mentioned as a leading brand with significant market penetration. Other notable competitors include imes-icore, Roland, and Amann Girrbach, which are also focused on producing milling systems. These brands are gaining traction and could challenge Sirona's position in the market.","2":"Dentsply Sirona has the highest ratio between total digital awareness and unaided awareness, along with the highest total awareness overall. Carestream also performs well but has lower awareness quality. Align Technology, while less known, demonstrates higher spontaneous mention frequency.","3":"In Spain, approximately 58% of indirect restorations are produced using a digital workflow. This indicates a significant adoption of digital technologies in the dental sector. The remaining 42% are produced using traditional techniques.","4":"The mean satisfaction score for all CAD-CAM brands in dental labs is 8.0. This score is based on feedback from various brands, indicating a generally positive satisfaction level among users.","5":"The net promoter score (NPS) in Italy in 2018 was reported to be 13, which is considered low and below the satisfactory threshold of 20. This score indicates that many respondents were detractors rather than promoters. Overall, the NPS values suggest a need for improvement in customer satisfaction.","6":"Spanish dental labs are approached by doctors about their recommendations on intra-oral scanners at least monthly, with some labs reporting daily inquiries. The frequency of these approaches tends to increase with the size and digitization level of the labs. Overall, Spain shows a higher-than-average frequency of contact compared to other countries.","7":"The main reasons dental professionals are hesitant to purchase an intra-oral scanner within the next two years are the high costs and the perception of a lack of need for the technology. Many professionals also prefer traditional methods, which contributes to their reluctance. Additionally, some are close to retirement, leading to lower demand for such investments.","8":"Formlabs is the leading brand of 3D printing units in Spain by a wide margin, followed by Anycubic. Formlabs dominates the penetration ranking across most countries, including Spain. The market is primarily characterized by a variety of players, but Formlabs stands out significantly.","9":"The most recommended iOS brand in dental labs in Europe is 3Shape, particularly in Spain and Italy.

In contrast, dental practices using intraoral scanners have a penetration rate of only 20%. This indicates a significantly higher adoption of scanning technology among laboratories compared to dental practices.","19":"I don't know.","20":"The main reasons for digital equipment users in Germany to use their in-lab milling scanner and base are to make daily practice easier and to enhance the quality of restorations. Flexibility in terms of a broader range of procedures and convenience are also considered important, but to a lesser extent.","21":"Approximately 18.5% of production is made by partner laboratories for dentists in Italy. The remaining production includes in-house work and contributions from manufacturers. This indicates a significant reliance on partner labs within the dental production landscape.","22":"The penetration of dental scanners in the sample of dental laboratories is 84%. This contrasts with dental practices, where only 20% reported using an intraoral scanner. Additionally, 55% of laboratories with scanners use them for sending outside scan files.","23":"Approximately 50% of laboratories that provide digital restorations send scans or models to partner labs. Additionally, 42% of them send models to manufacturers or milling centers. Therefore, a significant portion of European partner lab users also engage with manufacturers.","24":"In Italy, the weight of optical impressions out of the total impressions taken in dental practices is approximately 62.9%. This percentage indicates a significant use of digital impressions, although traditional materials remain prevalent.","25":"Bego has a high reputation, receiving some of the highest average scores in reliability, trustworthiness, and innovation.
