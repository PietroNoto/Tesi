Other brands like Carestream and Planmeca are also mentioned as having a presence in the digital technology market. However, Sirona currently holds a strong market position.","2":"The brand with the highest ratio between total digital awareness and unaided awareness is 3shape. This indicates that while it may not have the highest total awareness, it has a strong presence in terms of spontaneous recognition. Other brands like Zirkonzahn and Dentsply Sirona have higher total awareness but lower unaided mentions.","3":"In Spain, approximately 37.2% of indirect restorations are produced with a digital workflow. The majority, 62.8%, are still made using traditional techniques.","4":"The mean satisfaction score for all CAD-CAM brands in dental labs is 8.1. This score reflects an increase in the percentage of respondents who declare themselves \"very satisfied\" compared to previous years. Overall, the satisfaction ratings indicate a positive trend in user experience with these brands.","5":"The net promoter score in Italy in 2018 was +38%. This improvement was noted compared to previous years, indicating an increase in the percentage of advocates and a decrease in detractors. The mean score for that year was 8.0.","6":"Spanish dental labs are approached by doctors about their recommendations on intra-oral scanners with a frequency that can be considered \"monthly\" to \"daily.\" Approximately 30% of dental labs report being approached at least monthly, with larger and more digitized labs experiencing higher frequencies. Overall, Spain has a higher-than-average frequency of such approaches compared to other countries.","7":"The main reasons dental professionals are hesitant to purchase an intra-oral scanner within the next two years are primarily its high cost and a perceived lack of necessity for the technology. Many also prefer traditional methods and may be nearing retirement, which further reduces their interest in investing in new equipment. Concerns about low demand for such technology also contribute to their reluctance.","8":"The leading brand of 3D printing unit in Spain is Formlabs, which has a significant margin over competitors like Anycubic.

This figure may vary based on the number of dental units and the volume of patients serviced. Overall, there are about 185 cases of indirect restorations among the providers surveyed.","12":"The lowest weight on overall satisfaction for 3Shape is associated with items such as start-up training, frequency of software updates, and overall running costs. These items are considered critical areas for improvement, as they have high weight but lower satisfaction scores. Overall, while many aspects seem satisfactory, these specific areas are less favorable in contributing to overall satisfaction.","13":"Less than 2% of dental practices in Brazil have a chairside CAD-CAM unit.

In contrast, Italy and Spain exhibit different opinions regarding economic factors, with Spanish dentists placing more importance on price-related issues. This variability suggests that biases and stereotypes are more pronounced in France compared to the other two countries.","17":"31% of laboratories with three or more technicians plan to start providing fixed prosthetics using digital technologies within the next year.
