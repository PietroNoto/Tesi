About 46% of larger labs report frequent approaches, while 43% of labs generally do so when their business is thriving. The frequency of these approaches has increased significantly in recent years due to advancements in digital technologies within the sector.","7":"The main reasons dental professionals are hesitant to purchase an intra-oral scanner within two years are the high cost and a perceived lack of necessity for the device. Additionally, some practitioners prefer traditional methods over digital technologies.","8":"The leading brand of 3D printing units in Spain is Formlabs, which holds a significant market share. Other brands, such as DWS and Bego, follow behind but are not as dominant. Formlabs has established itself as the clear leader by a wide margin.","9":"The most recommended intraoral scanner brand in dental labs across Europe varies by country. 3shape is notably favored among larger labs, while Amann Girrbach is the leading brand in Germany, and Sirona is preferred in Italy and the UK. Zirkonzahn holds prominence in France, and Roland is recognized in Spain.","10":"The brand with the highest ratio between spontaneous and total notoriety in the digital equipment segment in Spain is Dentsply Sirona. It is followed by 3Shape and Carestream in terms of this ratio.","11":"The total number of restorations produced by digital flow prosthesis providers is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that, on average, 5.9 indirect restorations are produced per week by these providers. The exact total would depend on the number of providers and the duration of their operations.","12":"The lowest weight on overall satisfaction for 3Shape relates to items such as start-up training, frequency of software updates, and technical assistance in case of repair.
