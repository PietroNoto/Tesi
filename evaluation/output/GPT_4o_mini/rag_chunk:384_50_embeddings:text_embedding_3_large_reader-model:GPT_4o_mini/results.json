Overall, 3shape has a dominant reputation in the market.","1":"A future competitor to Sirona in CAD-CAM equipment is Amann Girrbach. Other emerging competitors in the market include Roland and Nobil Metal. These brands are noted for their growing presence in the CAD-CAM segment.","2":"Dentsply Sirona has the highest ratio between total digital awareness and unaided awareness. It also exhibits the highest total awareness overall among the brands analyzed. Carestream follows but with lower awareness quality.","3":"In Spain, approximately 37.2% of indirect restorations are produced using a digital workflow. This indicates a significant portion of restorations still relies on traditional techniques.","4":"The mean satisfaction score for all CAD-CAM brands in dental labs is 8.1. This score indicates an overall positive sentiment among users regarding their satisfaction with these brands. The assessment reflects improvements from previous years.","5":"The net promoter score in Italy in 2018 was 31%, a significant increase from 3% in 2015. This improvement was attributed to a rise in the percentage of advocates and a decrease in detractors.","6":"Spanish dental labs are approached by doctors about recommendations on intra-oral scanners with a frequency ranging from monthly to daily, with about 30% of labs being approached at least monthly. The frequency of these approaches tends to increase with the size and digitization level of the labs. Overall, Spain exhibits a higher-than-average frequency of such inquiries compared to other countries.","7":"The main reasons dental professionals are hesitant to purchase an intra-oral scanner within 2 years are primarily the high cost and a perceived lack of need for the technology. Many also prefer traditional methods over newer technologies. Additionally, factors such as retirement plans and low demand contribute to their reluctance.","8":"Formlabs is the leading brand of 3D printing units in Spain, with a significant market presence. Anycubic follows as the main competitor. The penetration of 3D printers in dental practices is notably low, but Formlabs remains the top choice among practitioners.","9":"The most recommended iOS brand in dental labs across Europe is 3shape, particularly favored in Spain and Italy. Itero is also popular, especially in the UK and among newer labs. Dentsply Sirona has a good reputation among labs receiving a high share of scan files.","10":"The brand with the highest ratio between spontaneous and total notoriety in the digital equipment segment in Spain is Dentsply Sirona. Carestream also performs well but has a lower spontaneous mention frequency. Align Technology is less known but has a high quality of notoriety due to spontaneous mentions.","11":"The total number of restorations produced by digital flow prosthesis providers is not explicitly mentioned in the retrieved context. However, it indicates that a significant portion of indirect restorations, including crowns, bridges, inlays, onlays, and veneers, are produced using digital workflows. The exact total number remains unclear.","12":"The lowest weight on overall satisfaction for 3Shape is associated with items related to start-up training, frequency of software updates, and technical assistance. These areas received lower satisfaction rates despite being important factors in the overall satisfaction assessment. Overall, these items are considered critical areas for improvement.","13":"The percentage of cad-cam users with a chairside in Brazil is not explicitly stated in the retrieved context. Therefore, I don't know the exact percentage.","14":"The most common in-house CAD\/CAM milling unit is from the brand Dentsply Sirona, which is known for its CEREC system.

The overall interest in adopting digital technologies has increased significantly in recent years.","18":"The penetration of dental scanners in the sample of European dental laboratories is 84%. This indicates a high adoption rate among laboratories for using scanners in their workflows. Additionally, 55% of laboratories use scanners for sending scan files outside the lab.","19":"Approximately 18% of Spanish laboratories that do not currently provide dental restorations digitally plan to start offering fixed prosthesis elements produced with digital technologies in the next year. This figure indicates a slight increase from previous years but reflects a persistent reluctance among some laboratories to adopt digital solutions.","20":"The main reasons for digital equipment users in Germany to use their in-lab milling scanner and base are the ease of daily practice and the quality of restorations. Additionally, flexibility in procedures and convenience are also considered important, but to a lesser extent. Overall, the focus is on improving efficiency and the quality of dental work.","21":"18.5% of production is made by partner laboratories for dentists in Italy.","22":"The penetration of dental scanners in the sample of dental laboratories is reported to be 84%. This indicates a high level of adoption of scanning technology within these labs.
