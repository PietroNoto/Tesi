**makes the daily practice easier (19%)**: the bar representing this reason has a moderate length, showing that just below half of the respondents valued this aspect. - **quality of the restorations (28%)**: this is the most significant reason according to the chart, as it represents more than a quarter of the total responses. - **broad and range procedures (16%)**: the bar indicates this aspect as the third most emphasized reason among the 230 cases. - **innovation (15%)**: with a relatively similar bar length to \"broad range of procedures,\" this reason is tied for the fourth place. - **other reasons (2%)**: this is the least significant factor in this list, with a very short bar. - **reputation of the brand (5%)**: this shows a slight preference, though it does not stand out among the major reasons. - **convenience (5%)**: once more, it is quite minimal and similar to \"reputation of the brand.\" - **flexibility (4%)**: this is slightly better than \"convenience\" and \"reputation of the brand\" but still minor. - **productivity increase (3%)**: it is the second most minuscule reason. 2. **in-lab milling**: - **makes the daily practice easier (39%)**: this represents a significant increase in value compared to the scanner category, indicating that in-lab milling is particularly valued for simplifying daily practice. - **quality of the restorations (25%)**: this is the second most valued among the respondents, highlighting the importance of restoration quality in in-lab milling. - **broad range of procedures (19%)**: slightly lower than the scanner category, this reason still holds considerable weight. - **flexibility (4%)**: similar to \"innovation\" in the scanner section, but slightly higher in the in-lab milling context. - **convenience (9%)**: a notable increase over the scanner, again suggesting in-lab milling's superiority here. - **innovation (4%)**: remains consistent with scanner, indicating modest importance. - **reputation of the brand (4%)**: the same as \"innovation\" and \"flexibility.\" - **productivity increase (3%)**: again, similar to \"productivity increase\" in the scanner comparison. - the **other** category is 3%. a notable observation is that the perception of using a scanner/in-lab milling unit varies significantly between the two contexts. for scanners, ease of daily practice is the most common reason, whereas for in-lab milling, ease and functionality dominate. on the right-hand side of the chart, there is a summary sentence \"daily practice made easier and quality of the restorations are the main reasons quoted by the digital equipment users. to a lesser extent, flexibility in terms of a broader range of procedures available and the convenience are also felt to be important.\" this aligns the visual data by emphasizing the pivotal role of ease of use and quality.",

chart titled \"brand positioning: overall brands\" and contains the content of omnivision d2h. the chart is designed to visually represent responses gathered from a survey about how individuals think of a number of overall brand attributes. this specific chart focuses on the respondents' opinion about how relevant they consider the statements across these attributes. there is a breakdown of responses categorized into five possible answers: \"not relevant\", \"quite relevant\", \"totally relevant\", \"mean\", and another unspecified cluster. the chart contains 196 quotes in total, with the mean score indicated as 4.0 for \"highly reputable\" in 2018 and 4.3 for \"highly reputable\" in the specific scores for various attributes vary amongst the respondents, showing the level of relevance each attribute possesses. moreover, there is a significant cluster identified as \"partially irrelevant,\" \"neutral,\" and the main clusters categorized based on the relevance. the visual indicators are shaded in different colors: blue for \"totally relevant\", pink for \"quite relevant\" or \"mean\", and purple for \"not relevant\". further analysis can be observed where \"reputable\" and \"trustworthy\" seem to possess the highest relevance scores with a rating of 4.0 in 2018 and 4.3 in 2015 respectively, while \"too expensive\" displays a lower relevance rating of in the context of the overall page, the chart occupies a significant space, serving as a key data presentation tool on the omnivision d2h page, illustrating a variety of consumer perceptions about various brand attributes. each attribute is listed alongside its respective scores, enabling a straightforward comparative analysis across multiple attributes. the image contains a detailed analysis that compares brand positioning across different attributes. it includes a table that ranks brand attributes by their perceived importance and reputation, measured across three different years: 2018, 2015, and a mean score. the table evaluates five distinct years of survey responses for 196 quotes. the table itself is divided into two main columns: the column on the left lists the attributes in descending order of median scores (2018, 2015, and mean). the column on the right provides a detailed breakdown of these attributes (2018, 2015, and mean scores). the attributes listed include \"highly reputable,\" \"trustworthy,\" \"worldwide renowned,\" \"innovative and at the forefront,\" \"reliable,\" \"leading company,\" \"recommendable to colleagues,\" \"makes daily practice easier,\" \"customer service oriented,\" \"affordable,\" \"too expensive,\" and \"good price quality ratio.\" each attribute is color-coded to represent its relevance and changes in perception between the years: orange color represents \"not relevant\" purple color represents \"quite relevant\" blue color represents \"totally relevant\" the image also includes a key indicating that the different colors correlate with the level of relevance of the brand's attributes. the analysis presents a clear picture of how brand perceptions have evolved between 2015 and 2018, showing distinct shifts in which attributes are most valued across different years. for example: \"highly reputable\" and \"worldwide renowned\" show significant shifts in perception, maintaining strong relevance despite slight fluctuations. \"reliable\" and \"leading company\" rank higher in recent years compared to 2015. \"makes daily practice easier\" and \"customer service oriented\" maintain their relevance over the years. \"too expensive\" and \"good price quality ratio\" are less frequently perceived as relevant in 2018 compared to earlier years. overall, the mean scores reveal shifts in consumer focus: \"good reputation,\" \"trustworthiness,\" and \"customer service oriented\" remain consistently highly rated. this comprehensive analysis illustrates how consumer priorities and perceptions have changed over the years and emphasizes the importance of addressing current value-driven factors in branding and marketing strategies.",

            "customer satisfaction: multiple regression analysis 102 apart from open technologies, showing a relevant weight for the factor performance, it looks like the regression models of the other investigated brands is predominantly driven by the operating costs, meaning that this factor highly affects the overall satisfaction of amann girrbach and 3shape, while for open technologies it has a marginal weight. as a matter of fact, for amman girrbach and 3shape, the items included in this factor emerged as key items to improve the overall satisfaction in the correlation analysis and the factor analysis highlighted the need to improve this topic. especially in the case of 3shape, looking back at its satisfaction scores in the factor analysis, it now looks more important strategically the weaker performance on the operating costs factor, more than the strong results on the performance factor. the image contains a pie chart which appears to be a simplified or a representative visual from the first image. this pie chart is labeled \"open technologies\" and illustrates the distribution of customer satisfaction based on three categories: performance, support, and operating costs. 1. **percentage allocation:** - **performance (purple slice):** the largest slice of the pie chart, accounting for 46% of the pie. this indicates that performance plays the most significant role in customer satisfaction for open technologies. - **support (orange slice):** the second-largest section representing 25% of the pie, showing that support is a significant but not dominant factor for customer satisfaction. - **operating costs (green slice):** the smallest slice, making up 29% of the pie chart. this suggests that while operating costs are important, they have a moderate impact on customer satisfaction compared to performance and support. 2. **placement and comparison with above chart:** - the first image provided includes not only the pie chart but also the detailed data for three different products: open technologies, amanngirrbach, and 3shape. - the pie chart from the first image gives a clear-cut summary but the second image only zooms into the data for open technologies. 3. **analytical context:** - the first image's accompanying text mentions the significance of performance and its impact on overall satisfaction. this is consistent with the pie chart where performance has the highest slice size (46%). - for open technologies, the data reflects higher emphasis on performance compared to support and operating costs. both images together provide a context of how different companies, focusing on their unique aspects, influence customer satisfaction, primarily indicating that performance is the critical factor for customers of open technologies. the second image shows a bar chart with four sets of data, representing three different technology companies: open technologies, amann girrbach, and 3shape. each set of data comprises three colors, indicating three different attributes: performance (depicted in blue), support (depicted in green), and operating costs (depicted in orange). here is a detailed visualization of the second image in the context of the first one: **open technologies**: - **performance**: 18% - **support**: 34% - **operating costs**: 18% - combined sum: 50% **amann girrbach**: - **performance**: 41% - **support**: 31% - **operating costs**: 48% - combined sum: 90% **3shape**: - **performance**: 43% - **support**: 31% - **operating costs**: 26% - combined sum: 100% the first image provides a pie chart that visually depicts the combined percentages of these three attributes for each company. it is evident that open technologies showcases a balanced distribution with the highest percentage in performance and operating costs at 41%. in contrast, amann girrbach emphasizes the importance of performance and support significantly, with 41% in performance and 31% in support, leading to a substantial 78% for these two categories. therefore, while amann girrbach excels in these areas, its operating costs are notably low. for 3shape, there is a more evenly split distribution, with 43% performance and 31% support. the lower operating costs compared to amann girrbach, at 26%, make it a more cost-efficient option. the combined percentages of all three companies, when summed, total 102%, reflecting the comprehensive analysis of customer satisfaction through the three criteria."

understanding the disparity between the general awareness of 3d printing technology and its specific application in dentistry among dentists across different european countries. the image contains a pie chart labeled \"no\" with 8% of the pie colored gray and the rest labeled \"yes\" with 92% colored white. the chart is set against a plain background with no additional annotations or text. the chart specifically represents a statistic or survey result concerning a yes-or-no question regarding 3d printing technology awareness among a surveyed group. the significant majority, 92%, are identified as being aware of the technology whereas a smaller segment, 8%, are not aware. this pie chart is placed towards the bottom left of an infographic, with the heading \"are you aware of the 3d printing technology?\" placed above it for context, indicating that it's a component of a larger survey or study addressing technological awareness. the image contains four distinct bar graphs arranged in two columns, indicating various percentages for different countries and a segment of those bar graphs colored differently from the others. from left to right, starting with the first column: the first bar is fully colored in blue, with 100% written above it. this suggests that all participants in this segment were aware of 3d printing technology. the first bar in the second set is colored in purple with 18% written below it. this indicates that 18% of the respondents were not aware of 3d printing technology, contrasting with the fully colored blue bar above it which signifies full awareness. the third bar is also blue but now labeled with 23%, which could imply a gap or a continuation in percentage understanding of 3d printing awareness compared to the column on the left, where all represented in blue. the right column: the first bar is in a vivid blue with 82% written, showing similar awareness. the second bar is purple and indicates 12%, suggesting 12% are not aware of 3d printing technology, again in contrast with the fully blue bars above them. the third bar is also blue with 88% written, consistent with the first column for the same awareness level. the fourth bar is more striking in its deep purple as it only shows 4% unaware, with 96% fully aware, making the lowest percentage of unawareness among the presented categories, potentially highlighting a unique situation or understanding within that particular group. the base notation indicates that 722 cases were used as a base for this data collection, showing the sample size's significance for the study. the image is from page 22 indicated at its lower right corner and its associated with a publication by omnivision digital and key-stone. the combination of these bar graphs with different colors and percentages effectively contrasts and illustrates varying levels of 3d printing awareness among different populations or subgroups, underscoring how general 3d print awareness diverges in dental environments versus general awareness. the image contains two similar pie charts, both depicting the level of awareness regarding 3d printing technology. the key differences between the two charts lie

overall. the second chart in the image correlates these averages with the specific frequency ranges of these treatments. the image contains a chart labeled \"new cases of fixed prostheses,\" which is an extraction from the larger infographic on the page, as seen in the first image. the chart is a horizontal bar graph that breaks down the data concerning the number of new cases involving fixed prostheses per month. the chart, specifically, focuses on the quantity of new fixed prosthesis cases conducted over different periods. the data is divided into three categories, each represented by a horizontal bar of different colors and lengths. 1. **less than 10 cases:** represented by a light blue bar, this category shows that 33% of the clinics reported a new number of fixed prosthesis cases falling below ten cases per month. 2. **from 10 to 19 cases:** represented by a dark blue bar, this category has a slightly shorter bar than the first one, indicating that 32% of clinics reported having new fixed prosthesis cases ranging between ten and nineteen cases per month. 3. **20 or more cases:** represented by the darkest blue bar, this category shows that 35% of clinics reported having at least twenty new fixed prosthesis cases per month. this category has the longest bar, signifying the highest percentage. each category is labeled with a corresponding color code and a percentage, making the distribution of new cases crystal clear. the use of gradient colors (light to dark blue) could indicate an increase in the number of cases from left to right. the overall color-coding scheme enhances visual comprehension, ensuring that readers can easily recognize and compare the quantities without confusion. the chart's conciseness and clarity provide a quick and impactful snapshot of the data, allowing for an easy comparison of the proportion of clinics experiencing new cases within different ranges. the image shows a bar chart that provides specific data on the distribution of different types of dentistry treatments performed monthly. this information is presented within the context of the larger content on the page, which appears to focus on dental procedures. the bar chart is designed to visualize the percentage of specific treatments (such as fillings/restorations, oral hygiene/scaling, implant, veneers, indirect inlays/onlays, and professional whitening) in various regions. *image content detailed:** 1. **header and title**: - the chart header indicates various types of dental treatments. - each treatment type has different categories represented by different colors: - white for less than 5 cases - light blue for a range from 5 to 10 cases - dark blue for more than 10 cases 2. **treatment types and categories**: -

whitening**: - less than 5 cases: 15% - from 5 to 10 cases: 46% - more than 10 cases: 23% - additional category: 17% 3. **legend**: - the charts legend at the bottom differentiates between treatment categories using specific color codes, clarifying which percentage falls into each category. 4. **footnote details**: - the footnote in the lower-right corner explains that the data involves the responses of non clinic owners, and emphasizes that the method used does not necessarily reflect the actual market stratification of dental practices. the sample size reference is provided as base: 1,061 cases. 5. **additional commentary**: - the right side of the image features a description that addresses performance heterogeneity across various countries, referencing the variability in the average size of dental clinics and the characteristics of their demands. overall, the image presents a structured approach to understanding the distribution and frequency of specific dental services performed monthly in clinical settings, with annotations that highlight the representativeness of the data and the methodological limitations."

**utilizamos impresión 3d** (we use 3d printing) - these individuals use 3d printing and most likely utilize it in their daily practice. 2. **light blue bars**: - **lo usamos ocasionalmente en el pasado, pero ya no lo hacemos** (we used it occasionally in the past, but no longer do it) - these individuals occasionally used 3d printing in the past, but it is not a current practice. 3. **purple bars**: - **estoy familiarizado con sus beneficios y usos, pero nunca lo probe** (i am familiar with its benefits and uses, but have never tried it) - these individuals are aware of the benefits and uses of 3d printing, but they have not personally tried it. 4. **gray bars**: - **conozco la impresión en 3d pero no estoy familiarizado con sus beneficios y usos** (i know about 3d printing but am not familiar with its benefits and uses) - while aware of 3d printing, these individuals are not familiar with its advantages or common applications. 5. **sandy beige bars**: - **nunca escuche de eso** (i have never heard of it) - these individuals have not come across or heard of 3d printing. each of these codes helps to classify the responses of clinicians and laboratories in the first image. the image contains a donut chart showing the concordance and usage of 3d imaging in clinical and laboratory settings. it is presented within a larger context of text and infographics. the particular focus here is the donut chart detailing the responses from clinical settings. the donut chart is labeled \"clinicas,\" indicating data from clinic-based responses. it illustrates three key statistics using different shades and colors: 1. **39%** - represented in light blue/blue segment, signifying clinicians who use 3d imaging as a tool. 2. **36%** - shown in dark blue, referring to clinicians who occasionally use or do not use 3d imaging. 3. **12%** - indicated in navy blue/purple for clinicians who are not familiar with 3d imaging. 4. **1%** - the smallest segment, in dark gray, which represents clinicians who do not use 3d imaging and are unlikely to change their stance. the text surrounding the chart and accompanying images emphasize factors influencing the adoption of 3d imaging in medical practice, particularly in clinical and laboratory environments. the overall message is to highlight the varying degrees of familiarity, usage, and adoption rates of 3d imaging among clinicians.",

darker blue: \"the relationship will become tighter because of the highly specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing\" - medium blue: \"the relationship will become blander because the cad processing will be even easier and it does not require specific expertise from the dentist\" - lighter blue: \"the relationship with the industry will become tighter because of the need for case specific manufactured products and services\" - grey: \"don't know\" 2. **x-axis**: this axis marks the different countries surveyed, labeled as de (germany), fr (france), it (italy), sp (spain), and uk (united kingdom). 3. **y-axis**: the bars themselves represent the percentage of respondents. y-axis values range from 0% to 50%, though specific intervals are not labeled. 4. **data representation**: each country has three bars representing the three categories: - germany (de): light blue (29%), medium blue (25%), darker blue (25%) - france (fr): light blue (28%), medium blue (32%), darker blue (31%) - italy (it): light blue (31%), medium blue (36%), darker blue (25%) - spain (sp): light blue (39%), medium blue (20%), darker blue (34%) - united kingdom (uk): light blue (25%), medium blue (25%), darker blue (57%) 5. **detailed description by country and category**: - **germany (de)**: there is a balanced distribution among the categories, with 25% of respondents thinking the relationship with the industry will tighten, 29% thinking it will become tighter due to technician specialization, and 25% indicating it will become blander. - **france (fr)**: reflects a shift, with 31% believing the relationship will tighten, 32% indicating blandering due to cad processing not requiring dental expertise, and the lowest proportion of 28% for industry tightening by demand for specialized products and services. - **italy (it)**: another balanced representation, with 25% expecting tightening, 36% blandering due to cad processing, and 25% for industry tightening. - **spain (sp)**: shows an initial inclination toward 39% for industry tightening, followed by 20% blandering, and 34% expecting tightening due to technician specialization. - **united kingdom (uk)**: has an interesting distribution, showing 57% belief in industry tightening, 25% for technician specialization tightening, and equally lower proportion (25%) on blandering because of cad processing. the graph allows for cross-comparison among different national responses and reflections regarding the impact of new digital technologies on dental industry dynamics. the percentages highlight varying degrees of trust, expertise, and adaptability across these countries toward the anticipated changes in professional and industry relationships. the second image is a list of responses extracted from the pie chart and bar graph in the first image. it details how respondents in different countries perceive the changes in the relationship among dentists, technicians, and the industry following the introduction of new digital technologies. ### detail description of the second image: *title:** the relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing the relationship will become blander because the cad processing will be even easier and it does not require specific expertise from the dentists the relationship with the industry will become tighter because of the need for case specific manufactured products and services *responses:** the image outlines the distribution of responses across four categories: 1. **\"the relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing\":** -

            "scenario: role of dentists and technicians in the future how do you think dentists and technicians role will change with the new digital technologies? 17 base: 722 cases interestingly, the highest percentage of statements about the fact that the dentists will replace part of the technicians activity, come from those not involved in digital prosthetics and, among those providing digital restorations, from those doing this in full outsourcing. the image contains a venn diagram that is used to illustrate different categories related to the roles of dentists and technicians in the field of dentistry. the chart appears to be part of a larger study, as seen in the first image, which discusses the changing roles with the advent of new digital technologies. the diagram includes three distinct shapes, with numbers indicating the percentage values for each segment. the largest segment, taking up nearly half of the circle, is colored blue and contains the number \"58%\", which denotes a significant group or category. in this segment, a caption indicates that 58% of statements about dentists replacing the technician activity come from those involved in digital restorations but not the full outsourcing. the second segment, colored in light blue, represents \"19%\", and is captioned with the fact that the cooperation between dentists and technicians will increase due to the growing importance of technological skills in dental procedures. this light blue area includes statements about the increased relevance of digital processing and technicians' roles therein. the third segment, colored in dark blue, takes up 21% and is captioned with a statement about the growing need for dentists to gain expertise in prosthetics. this segment also relates to the changing dynamics where dentists will perform more work that traditionally required technicians, due to the evolution of materials and knowledge. additionally, these segments overlap with each other, suggesting that each category overlaps or is partly influenced by the other categories. the overall context indicates this is part of a study to understand how changes in digital technology will shift the responsibilities and expertise required of dentists and dental technicians. the second image is a compilation of four interlinked horizontal bar charts that are part of data from a survey titled \"how do you think dentists and technicians role will change with the new digital technologies?\" this data was derived from interviews with 72 cases. ### description of the second image 1. **categories and titles**: - the data is divided into six categories, displayed as titles on the horizontal bar charts: digit. restor. provider (dental restorative providers) technology (types of restorative technologies) channel (channels for distribution or service) - each category lists three options that reflect different aspects of how dentists and technicians' roles might evolve with technology: 'no,' 'yes,' and a series of more specific technological or procedural components like in-lab milling, scanning, full outsourcing, manufacturer, and partner lab. 2. **horizontal bar charts**: - the bar charts employ shades of blue and beige to differentiate the 'no,' 'yes,' and percentage values. - each categorical axis on the left shows different technologies or procedural roles. the primary colors in the bars represent the percentage of respondents who agreed or disagreed. - **digit. restor. provider (no)**: 22% - **digit. restor. provider (yes)**: 64% - **technology (in-lab milling)**: 15% - **technology (scanning)**: 74% - **technology (full outsourcing)**: 41% - **technology (manufacturer)**: 21% - **technology (partner lab)**: 26% - **technology channel (in-lab milling)**: 11% - **technology channel (digit. restor. manufacturer)**: 65% - **technology channel (scanning)**: 11% - **technology channel (full outsourcing)**: 23% 3. **additional notes and assumptions**: - a footnote indicates that the roles will change because: - everyone will always need to perform their own distinct role. - the cooperation between dentists and technicians will increase due to critical areas like esthetics and digital processing. - technicians may need more expertise about restoratives technologies and aesthetics. - the roles of technicians may evolve due to the shift towards full outsourcing. ### contextual analysis: in the context of the first image, which provides an overview of how dental professionals might perceive future changes in roles, this second image is a detailed breakdown of the perceptions of specific tools, technologies, and procedures that inform those broader categories of change. it highlights how different respondents feel towards certain technology applications and full outsourcing channels, offering a nuanced view of future expectations. the image contains a textual summary of the survey responses from a study conducted by omnivision and key-stone. it presents the distribution of opinions about how the roles of dentists and technicians will change in the future due to new digital technologies. the data is visualized with a bar graph and pie chart. in the bar graph: \"no\" has 19% of the responses. \"yes\" is represented by 22%, which is slightly higher than \"no.\" below the main categories, there are three narrower categories: - \"in-lab mill\" has a small percentage of 3%. - \"full outsourcing\" is 25%. - \"manufacturer partner lab\" is 14%. - each narrow category shows lesser percentages. the pie chart provides a more detailed view, with the following distribution: 21% believe there will be \"full outsourcing.\" 22% think in \"manufacturer partner lab.\" \"in-lab mill\" and \"do not know\" have 2% and 1%, respectively. technically, \"scanning\" is represented as 50%, and \"digit. restorer. provider\" as 25%. \"yes\" is 64%, and \"technology\" is 17%. this shows that \"scanning\" is more likely regarded as part of 'technology,' whereas \"digit. restorer. provider\" may be interpreted as focusing on 'full outsourcing.' in the textual description: \"omnivision digital\" and \"key-stone\" are highlighted. the context given is that \"there will not be any change at all has 19%, \"cooperation between dentists and technicians will increase,\" and that dentists might need more expertise in prosthetics, which would be required to perform parts of the work in charge of technicians holds significant portion (64%). this suggests an increased role of cooperation and expertise as perceived by survey participants.",

technology available for dentistry as well: only a very small portion of the respondents declare not to be aware of it (4%). 3d printing seems to be more widely used among less young dentists and big sized surgeries. base: 282 cases (whole sample) the image contains a pie chart with sections representing different percentages related to 3d printing awareness and use in dentistry. there are four main sections, each color-coded and labeled with corresponding percentages: 1. **deep blue section (48%):** this largest section, shaded in a deep blue, denotes \"we use 3d printing at our practice.\" it represents the highest percentage of respondents who have implemented 3d printing in their dental practices. 2. **light blue section (47%):** the next major section, in a lighter blue, represents \"i am familiar with its benefits and uses, but never tried it (awareness).\" this section indicates that respondents understand the potential of 3d printing but have not yet utilized it in their practices. 3. **gray section (4%):** this smaller section, shaded in gray, states \"i am aware of 3d printing, but not familiar with its benefits and uses (awareness).\" this represents a small group of respondents who are generally aware of 3d printing but lack specific knowledge about its applications in dentistry. 4. **very slight blue section (1%):** the smallest section, shaded in a very light blue, indicates \"never heard of it.\" this portion signifies a small fraction of respondents who are not aware of 3d printing at all. on the right side of the pie chart, there is a vertical percentage scale showing that 1% own a 3d printer in their surgeries, specifically noted for young dentists and bigger surgeries. furthermore, the text accompanying the pie chart highlights various points: despite some practices providing customized devices made from 3d printers, only 1% own their own. among 3d printing technology, only 4% of respondents declare to be aware of it. young dentists and larger surgeries report more frequently the usage of 3d printing. the base note at the bottom left of the image states, \"base: 282 cases (whole sample),\" suggesting that the survey includes all respondent cases, totaling the overall layout is neat and clean, with the text providing clear context about the usage statistics of 3d printing in dentistry. the image contains a smaller inset chart located towards the bottom of the larger data visualization page, which appears to be a part of a report or presentation on 3d printing awareness and usage. the inset chart utilizes a pie chart to illustrate a group of responses related to the adoption and familiarity with 3d printing in a dental practice setting. each segment of the pie chart corresponds to a specific category, represented by distinct colors. **we use 3d printing at our practice**: this is shown in blue, constituting 48% of the pie chart. **i am familiar with its benefits and uses, but never tried it (awareness)**: represented in light blue, this category comprises 47% of the total. **i am aware of 3d printing, but not familiar with its benefits and uses (awareness)**: indicated in grey, accounts for 4% of the pie chart. **never heard of it**: shown in dark blue, this segment makes up the remaining 1%. below the pie chart is a bracket that provides a visual representation of the percentage figures, aligning with the segments of the pie and confirming the data percentages. adjacent to the pie chart is a brief explanatory note regarding the data. the note reads as follows: \"despite quite some practices

dental practitioners, which underscores the rapid uptake of the technology. it further highlights a possible generational trend where 3d printing is more prevalent among older practitioners and larger surgical practices. to the right of the chart, a legend in text format specifies the color code associated with each segment of the pie chart for reader reference. this includes: **1% owners** (denotes the light blue segment) **99% non-owners** (denotes the dark blue segment) this concise inclusion offers an at-a-glance understanding of 3d printing adoption and awareness levels in dental practices. the source and base sample number is cited below the pie chart, indicating 282 cases, which suggests the data spans a large enough population to offer meaningful insights into dental practitioners' familiarity and usage of 3d printing. *concluding observation**: the image, as a whole, thus portrays a snapshot of the rapid technological adoption in dentistry, notably the early stages of integrating 3d printing into dental practices, reflected by the significant awareness levels but a notably lesser share who can claim having a printing device, with a hint at its growing influence especially among a specialized demographic within the dental field.",

\"completely agree\" is color-coded in orange and is represented within the bar. - \"rather agree\" is in yellow. - \"rather disagree\" is in blue. - \"completely disagree\" is in dark blue. - \"dont know, no answer\" is in grey and is not distinctly visualized within the bars, suggesting a negligible portion. *3m (37 quotes)**: the second bar is for the responses from the 3m sample group. - \"completely agree\" is again in orange. - \"rather agree\" is in yellow. - \"rather disagree\" is in blue. - \"completely disagree\" is in dark blue. - \"dont know, no answer\" remains in grey and is not clearly shown separately, implying a small group. *response distribution:** \"completely agree\" appears to have the highest response within both bars but is somewhat variable. \"rather agree\" and \"rather disagree\" show moderate response rates. \"completely disagree\" responses are relatively low. \"dont know\" responses are minimal. *legend and labels:** the legend, positioned towards the front, explains the color coding next to each text box, providing clarity on how to interpret the responses. theres a \"mean\" section displaying average numbers corresponding to each bar, enhancing understanding of overall sentiment. *image insight**: the graph shows varied responses under different response categories indicative of brand reputation and perception between the total sample and the 3m sample. the key highlights a tendency where respondents lean towards agreement over disagreement, suggesting a positive brand image. the image contains a line graph comparing the mean scores of two data sets across six categories: \"well renowned brand,\" \"cutting edge and innovative,\" \"leading company in the segment,\" \"very trustworthy,\" \"recommendable to colleagues,\" and \"customer service oriented.\" the graph is designed to show the difference in reputation evaluation for two groupsthe total sample (labeled as total) and 3m (likely referring to a specific group known as 3m). in the graph: 1. **horizontal axis (x-axis)**: the categories that are assessedwell renowned brand, cutting edge and innovative, leading company in the segment, very trustworthy, recommendable to colleagues, and customer service oriented. 2. **vertical axis (y-axis)**: the rating scale for each category, running from 1 (completely disagree) to 10 (completely agree). 3. **clusters**: - the graph is divided into three clusters indicating different levels of agreement ratings: 10 for \"completely agree,\" 5 for \"completely disagree,\" and unspecified ratings in between. - clusters of 10 are represented in light blue, 5 in pink, and in between in green. 4. **legend**: there are two linesone for the total sample (green line) and the other for the 3m sample (pink line)each showing their respective ratings across the categories. 5. **legend descriptions**: - green line with markers labeled 'total'. it aligns with the total sample data point values. - pink line with markers labeled '3m'. it aligns with the 3m sample data point values. 6. **data points**: - the graph shows paired data points for each category where a mean is calculated, visualizing the averages for what each group considers essential or agreeable. key insights include: - mean agreement for both total and 3m in \"well renowned brand\" is around 8.3. - mean agreement for both in \"cutting edge and innovative\" sits at approximately 6.5. - mean agreement for \"leading company in the segment\" and \"very trustworthy\" is around 7.8 for the total category and slightly lower for the 3m category but still close. 7. **mean comparison**: using a color-coded legend, the mean values for both total and 3m samples are plotted. data points show: - higher ratings with clustering at the extremes (10 and 5) suggesting high evaluations. - both segments share similar distributions across categories with only slight variances indicating different evaluations. in context, the graph shows that both the total sample and the 3m sample evaluate several attributes similarly highly, but there are slight differences indicating varying emphasis or values attributed to different aspects within each sample group. the image contains ten stacked bar graphs, each representing the responses to survey questions related to brand image perceptions. each vertical bar corresponds to a different response category, color-coded with yellow and blue. the stacked bars are arranged by their respective percentages for each response category, illustrating how different attitudes towards the brand are distributed among the surveyed respondents. on the left side, the first stacked bar appears to show the smallest response percentage, followed by larger percentages stacked subsequently as we move rightwards. each individual horizontal bar segment represents a specific response option selected by the respondents. for instance, one bar segment is labeled \"completely agree,\" suggesting users of that option rate the brand highest on their perceived attributes. the right side of the image shows similar segmented stacked bars, each indicating a different set of response categories across the respondents. this section is slightly offset, suggesting a comparison between two groups: total respondents and a specific subset of 3m respondents as indicated at the top-right corner. the color shifts from yellow to purple, which likely represent different datasets for comparison purposes. at the bottom, the stacked bars have larger segments, indicating more respondents chose the highest response \"completely agree\". this suggests that the specific subset of \"3m\" respondents have a noticeably higher approval or perception in comparison to the general population. the second image on the right side includes a small bar graph showing average mean scores for brand image from different response categories. this bar graph aids in understanding the central or typical response range among all participants. along the bottom, there are descriptive legends for each colored segment, providing clarity on the meaning of each response segment, further detailing the understanding of each color-coded segment. overall, the image presents an analytical comparison between two groups showing their response distribution to specific brand image and service-related questions, illustrating both the highest acceptance and areas needing improvement. the second image is a table presenting comparative data concerning brand attributes measured among respondents. it is divided into two main sections titled \"total sample (370 quotes)\" and \"3m (37 quotes)\" to compare data between larger and smaller samples. the purpose of this table appears to be analyzing responses about brand attributes, probably for purposes of a market research survey. below is a detailed description of the second image: ### **header: brand image** *text:** \"how much do you agree the following statements are relevant to the brands that i'm going to read out to you? please, use a scale where 1 stands for completely disagree and 10 stands for completely agree.\" ### **structure of the table:** **rows:** each row represents different brand image attributes, organized in descending order from top to bottom. the attributes are: - well recognized brand - cutting edge and innovative - leading company in the segment - very trustworthy - too expensive - recommended to colleagues - makes daily practice easier - customer service oriented -

18% in total sample - 37% in the 3m sample **cutting edge and innovative:** - 18% in total sample - 44% in the 3m sample **leading company in the segment:** - 23% in total sample - 36% in the 3m sample **very trustworthy:** - 13% in total sample - 32% in the 3m sample **too expensive:** - 18% in total sample - 20% in the 3m sample **recommended to colleagues:** - 19% in total sample - 31% in the 3m sample **makes daily practice easier:** - 16% in total sample - 27% in the 3m sample **customer service oriented:** - this column's rows are visually shorter, indicating lower responses. - 12% in total sample - 27% in the 3m sample **approachable, friendly:** - 14% in the total sample - this row does not appear in the 3m section, indicating no data available or irrelevant data collected. ### **visuals:** **color coding:** - **blue**: represents the total sample percentage values. - **yellow**: represents the 3m sample percentage values. **mean**: on the right side of the table, a line graph indicating the mean is visible: - **total**: orange to dark orange gradient. - **3m**: yellow to greenish gradient. - specific mean values indicated alongside the line graph. ### **additional elements:** **clusters**: - a pie-like cluster chart at the bottom right shows: - **1-5**: completely disagree - **10**: completely agree - the percentages corresponding to the clusters in total and 3m samples. **key-stone**: at the footer, presumably, the logo or mark of the company that conducted the research or prepared the presentation. ### **analysis and insights from the image:** the table provides a clear comparative viewpoint, indicating higher positive perception of the brand attributes in the 3m sample, especially in terms of cutting edge and innovative. this higher sentiment might suggest a more selective or elite demographic in the 3m sample. the highlighted mean values visually reinforce that perceptions of the brand's quality, innovation, trustworthiness, and customer orientation are significantly higher among the 3m sample. this kind of data can be crucial for companies aiming to understand the factors driving brand loyalty and for developing targeted strategies to enhance these areas further. by analyzing the data from different samples, brands and marketers can identify key areas of focus for improving customer perception and tailor their marketing strategies to maximize the benefits of positive brand attributes. understanding that a different sample may present a different picture is crucial because it helps refine methods to ensure they are reaching the appropriate target audience effectively. the image contains a list of statements relevant to assessing brand image, adapted to fit into a larger, more detailed survey context (as seen in the first image). the statements included are: well renowned brand cutting edge and innovative leading company in the segment very trustworthy too expensive recommendable to colleagues make my daily practice easier customer service oriented approachable, friendly these statements form part of a survey aimed at gauging consumer views on a brand across various dimensions such as reputation, innovation, trust, pricing, and accessibility. the purpose of this survey is to gather insights into the perceptions and attitudes that customers hold toward the brand, aligning closely with the data visualization done by key-stone displayed in the first image.",

**globally achieved (mundialmente consigido)**: both charts illustrate similar values, indicating balanced importance perception. - **makes daily practice easier (facilita la práctica diaria)**: these values slightly drop in the closer view as in both images. - **quality/price (buena calidad/precio)**: this trait shows the least deviation, being the least significant in both. - **too expensive (demasiado caro)**: the charts suggest consistent negative perception about affordability. thus, the chart visually communicates that while brand trust and reliability continue to be the most significant factors, customer service, aesthetic considerations, and company leadership follow closely. additionally, the importance placed on brand reputation and overall global success aligns consistently. however, considerations around perceived quality for the price and costs reflect a more nuanced or contentious perception. the second image is an infographic that visually represents the data from a correlation analysis, comparing the importance and media impact of various items. the chart employs visual elements such as bar height and color coding to convey the data effectively. here is a detailed analysis: *title and subtitle:** the title at the top reads \"¿en qué medida tiene valor los siguientes items en la recomendación? 3shape,\" which translates to \"how valuable are the following items in a recommendation?\" the subtitle, \"análisis de correlación de 3shape muestra que los items más relevantes en el análisis global, con una importancia mayor que se otorga un ‘compañía lider’, que se convierte en uno de los items más relevantes,\" translates to \"the 3shape correlation analysis shows that items most relevant in the overall analysis, with an importance higher than ‘leading company,’ which becomes one of the most relevant items.\" *bar chart description:** the chart is bifurcated into two main categories: \"importancia de los items\" (importance of items) and \"puntuación media\" (media score). - on the left side, the items are listed vertically, with their corresponding importance scores. - on the right side, the items are listed vertically again, with their corresponding average scores. each item has a bar associated with its importance score (gray) and media score (red) to illustrate the range. notably, at the bottom of the left side, there is an item marked as \"demaiciado caro\" (demonstratively costly) with no significant value in the importance or media score sections. *items and scores:** **confianza** (trust, 0.844) has a media score around 3.0. **fianzdidad** (faithfulness, 0.911) boasts a high score, approximately 4.0, slightly over 3.8. **servicio orientado al cliente** (customer-oriented service, 0.755) scores around 3.7. **asegurable** (insurable, 0.714) has a score of about 3.9. **facilidad la práctica diaria** (facilitates day-to-day practices, 0.660) is around 3.8. **innovador y la vanguardia** (innovative and cutting-edge, 0.650) is lower at around 3.7. **de gran reputación** (high reputation, 0.578) scores approx. 3.7. **mundialmente conocido** (globally recognized, 0.667) is slightly above 3.9. **compañía lider** (leading company, 0.753) holds a significant score around 4.1, indicating its prominence in both importance and media performance. **buena calidad/precio** (good quality/value, 0.343) has a very low score, close to 3.8. **demaiciado caro** (demonstratively costly, 0.0) has no significant score and is marked explicitly as such. *design and layout:** the design employs a clean, professional layout with a predominant white background and distinct red and gray bars for clarity. items are listed in a way that aids in the comparison of their importance and average scores. a dotted vertical line delineates the threshold where no significant media score applies, aligned at the bottom of the chart. *conclusion using chain of thought:** the infographic from the first image reveals that various items in the analysis contribute differently to the overall recommendation value. the importance and media scores highlight how customer-oriented services (0.755) and globally recognized brands (0.667) are significant but not as high as the leading company (0.753), which scores 4. this indicates a higher market impact and customer trust associated with a leading company or brand. the data emphasizes the need for a multifaceted approach in recommending products or services, where leading companies are perceived as superior both in importance and media impact. other factors such as service quality (0.345) and perceived cost (3.8) significantly affect customer decisions yet are not as dominant. in contrast, the item \"demonstratively costly\" (0.0) highlights that being expensive does not translate into a positive recommendation unless effectively marketed or justified. this detailed examination supports understanding how various components contribute differently to consumer perception and decision-making processes."

rank within respondents perceptions across these four attributes. the visual comparison across the four categories provides valuable insights into public perception and market positioning among professionals in likely dental-related industry. the image contains a horizontal bar chart. the chart is part of a page that presents the results of a survey about brand awareness and perceptions of various companies related to four different attributes: high reputation, historical/traditional, scientific, and excellent/the best. on the horizontal axis are the names of the companies, categorized in a descending order of their market shares or recognition based on the specified attributes. the vertical axis, however, does not display numerical values but rather provides a visual representation of the proportions, with longer bars indicating a higher proportion of responses. some of the most significant findings are: **3m:** the company 3m has the strongest representation in all four categories, with 16% for high reputation, 16% for historical/traditional, 18% for scientific, and 17% for excellent/the best. **dentsply sirona:** it holds the second-highest proportion in high

both historical/traditional (8%) and scientific (14%). **ivoclar and kulzer:** they appear mid-range with percentages around the low to mid teens for most of the categories. **coltene/septodont:** these brands are also in the mid-range group and share similar patterns with other names like strumann, nobel biocare, henry schein, etc. **komet and ultracent:** they are in the lower end, indicated by shorter bars, particularly in higher reputation and high reputation. **other:** an overarching 20% is marked for companies which are either \"other,\" indicating a significant portion of

survey data, showcasing brand trust and recognition across four key attributes. the image contains a bar graph titled \"attribute associations, among all company brands that you know.\" this graph is part of a larger infographic which provides a comparative analysis of consumer perceptions regarding different attributes associated with pharmaceutical brands. the specific bar graph is focused on the attribute 'scientific', showing various responses to the question of which brand is the closest to this attribute. the bar graph includes 11 distinct company brands or product categories as listed below: 1. **3m**: 18% 2. **dentsply sirona**: 16% 3. **ivocar**: 8% 4. **straumann**: 5% 5. **gc**: 5% 6. **kerr**: 3% 7. **nobel biocare**: 3% 8. **kulzer**: 3% 9. **kuraray noritake**: 2% 10.

the other specified categories. there are also additional responses indicating that: 6% of respondents do not know or provide no answer. this bar graph is visually represented with horizontal bars, where the height of each bar corresponds to the percentage of respondents who associate each brand with the 'scientific' attribute. the specific lengths of each bar clearly communicate the differences in perceived scientific association among the various brands. for example, 3m is prominently shown as the brand most closely associated with the scientific attribute, followed by dentsply sirona, ivocar, and straumann, whereas brands like kerr, nobel biocare, kulzer, kuraray noritake, and voco are less associated with the scientific attribute. the 'other' category is highlighted by a notably larger gray bar which suggests a strong grouping of responses that do not fit the classified attributes, reflecting a high degree of complexity and variety in brand associations according to this study. the image contains a bar chart from the **attribute associations** section. it compares how respondents associate different pharmaceutical companies with various attributes across a sample of 1018 cases. the attributes include \"high reputation,\" \"historical/traditional,\" \"scientific,\" and \"excellent/the best.\" for the attribute \"excellent/the best,\" the top selections are: **3m** with 17% of respondents associating them with this attribute. **dentsply sirona** with 14%. **gc** at 8%. the distribution is relatively low for most other companies, with responses of 4% or less. specifically, these companies include: **ivoclar** at 7%. **kavo** and **straumann** are tied at 4%. **kerr** is at 2%. other companies like **kulzer**, **coltene**, **nobel biotec**, **kuraray

**makes the daily practice easier (19%)**: the bar representing this reason has a moderate length, showing that just below half of the respondents valued this aspect. - **quality of the restorations (28%)**: this is the most significant reason according to the chart, as it represents more than a quarter of the total responses. - **broad and range procedures (16%)**: the bar indicates this aspect as the third most emphasized reason among the 230 cases. - **innovation (15%)**: with a relatively similar bar length to \"broad range of procedures,\" this reason is tied for the fourth place. - **other reasons (2%)**: this is the least significant factor in this list, with a very short bar. - **reputation of the brand (5%)**: this shows a slight preference, though it does not stand out among the major reasons. - **convenience (5%)**: once more, it is quite minimal and similar to \"reputation of the brand.\" - **flexibility (4%)**: this is slightly better than \"convenience\" and \"reputation of the brand\" but still minor. - **productivity increase (3%)**: it is the second most minuscule reason. 2. **in-lab milling**: - **makes the daily practice easier (39%)**: this represents a significant increase in value compared to the scanner category, indicating that in-lab milling is particularly valued for simplifying daily practice. - **quality of the restorations (25%)**: this is the second most valued among the respondents, highlighting the importance of restoration quality in in-lab milling. - **broad range of procedures (19%)**: slightly lower than the scanner category, this reason still holds considerable weight. - **flexibility (4%)**: similar to \"innovation\" in the scanner section, but slightly higher in the in-lab milling context. - **convenience (9%)**: a notable increase over the scanner, again suggesting in-lab milling's superiority here. - **innovation (4%)**: remains consistent with scanner, indicating modest importance. - **reputation of the brand (4%)**: the same as \"innovation\" and \"flexibility.\" - **productivity increase (3%)**: again, similar to \"productivity increase\" in the scanner comparison. - the **other** category is 3%. a notable observation is that the perception of using a scanner/in-lab milling unit varies significantly between the two contexts. for scanners, ease of daily practice is the most common reason, whereas for in-lab milling, ease and functionality dominate. on the right-hand side of the chart, there is a summary sentence \"daily practice made easier and quality of the restorations are the main reasons quoted by the digital equipment users. to a lesser extent, flexibility in terms of a broader range of procedures available and the convenience are also felt to be important.\" this aligns the visual data by emphasizing the pivotal role of ease of use and quality."

difference from mean. this is a comparative analysis of how consumers rated seven different attributes of the company compared to the average (mean). the chart appears to be extracted from a larger report and is marked as page 61 at the bottom. the horizontal bar chart includes two sets of bars: green bars for one group of attributes and red bars for a control group or comparison. heres a breakdown of the content and data within this image: ### title information **brand focus:** totally relevant **difference from mean:** indicates whether the positive or negative perception of the company is more intense compared to the average opinion. ### attributes and observations each attribute listed has two corresponding bars: **all brands (1,142 quotes):** representing the general perception of customers. **ultravanta (36 quotes):** a specific group or subset of customer feedback. **voco (58 quotes):** another specific group or subset of customer feedback. below is a detailed breakdown of each attribute and the corresponding differences in perception: 1. **this company has a high reputation** - **all brands:** +19% - **ultravanta:** +28% - **voco:** +16% 2. **this company has products with the highest quality** - **all brands:** +15% - **ultravanta:** +13% - **voco:** +7% 3. **the company has a long-time tradition** - **all brands:** +15% - **ultravanta:** -2% - **voco:** -1% 4. **the products of this company are the easiest to use** - **all brands:** -13% (which likely indicates a common negative perception) - **ultravanta:** -15% -

difference from mean\". it shows a comparison of perceptions of two groups of customers, referred to as \"ultradent\" and \"voco\", based on the difference in their mean brand perception scores. the data reflects how they rate different brand attributes in comparison to the average (mean) perceptions. below is a detailed description of the chart: 1. **legend and labeling**: two categories of customers are represented: \"all brands (1,142 quotes)\", which includes combined data from both groups, and \"ultradent (36 quotes)\" and \"voco (58 quotes)\", which are presumably the specific consumer groups surveyed. 2. **brand attributes ratings**: the chart bars represent each individual attribute rated by the customers for relevance compared to the mean. there are ten attributes: - this company has a high reputation - this company has products with the highest quality - this company has a long-time tradition - the products of this company are the easiest to use - i trust this company more than others - i think that it is the right company for innovation - i feel this company to be among the most customer-oriented ones - i feel this company to be among the most familiar and friendly one - this company supports my business development more than others - the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio 3. **percentages difference**: - attributes like this company has a high reputation\" and \"this company has products with the highest quality are rated significantly higher by both ultradent and voco customers than the mean, especially for ultradent with 28% and 13% respectively. - conversely, there are attributes where customers, particularly ultradent, give notably lower scores: - \"this company is easy to use\" with -21% - \"this company supports my business development more than others\" with -20% - \"the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio\" with -15% 4. **graph orientation**: - the x-axis shows the attributes while the y-axis represents the percentage difference in customer perceptions relative to the mean. - bars are shaded green to indicate positive deviations from the mean and red to indicate negative deviations. - ultradent has more bars in red compared to voco, indicating a strong difference from the mean. 5. **visual style and source**: - the overall design is simplistic with a clear and readable color scheme. - the bottom of the image includes a watermark of brandequity, the source of the data, along with the page number indicating it is a part of a larger document or report. this bar chart is useful for understanding how customers within different segments view company attributes, highlighting where positive feedback is concentrated and where there is dissatisfaction. the stark contrast in perception across different attributes allows for focused improvements tailored to the preferences and expectations of each customer group. the highlighted positive attributes can encourage continued investment in areas where these groups value high reputation and quality, while the negative attributes will need targeted attention to address customer concerns and improve overall satisfaction scores. the image shows a survey response with the heading \"brand image: focus on 'totally relevant' difference from mean in your opinion, how do you rate the mentioned brands in the following areas?\" it provides a list of seven statements representing various aspects of a brand image, along with associated responses that indicate the perceived importance and relevance of these statements among customers. here are the specific elements of the image: 1. **header information:** - each statement begins with phrases like \"this company has a high reputation\" and \"the products of this company are the easiest to use.\" - these statements are categorized into three groups based on sample sizes: - \"all brands (1,142 quotes)\" - \"ultradent (36 quotes)\" - \"voco (58 quotes)\" 2. **statements listed:** - \"this company has a high reputation\" - positively rated with different percentages for the three groups. - \"this company has products with the highest quality\" - positively rated. - \"this company has a long-time tradition\" - positively rated with a 15% difference between all brands and ultradent and voco. - \"the products of this company are the easiest to use\" - negatively rated with differences in perception across all groups. - \"i trust this company more than others\" - negatively rated for all brands, ultradent, and voco. - \"i think that it is the right company when i look for innovation\" - negatively rated with significant differences for ultradent and voco. - \"i feel this company to be among the most customer-oriented ones\" - negatively rated for ultradent and voco. - \"i feel this company to be among the most familiar and friendly one\" - positively rated but with a negative implication for voco. - \"this company supports my business development more than others\" - negatively rated. - \"the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio\" - positively rated for all brands, with voco showing a strong +21%. 3. **data representation:** - the responses for each statement are displayed using green bars (positive ratings) and red bars (negative ratings). - percentages show the difference from the mean rating for each category (all brands, ultradent, and voco). - a slide number \"61\" is located at the bottom right corner. 4. **logos and credits:** - brandequity logo with the text \"brande equity clinic\" - positioned at the bottom left. - key-stone logo with the text \"key-stone\" placed at the bottom right. this image is part of a larger survey page that likely analyzes consumer sentiment toward different brands, focusing specifically on the aspects of brand perception and comparison between different categories based on sampled surveys. the image contains a bar chart with a title labeled \"brand image: focus on totally relevant - difference from mean.\" below the title, there is a prompt that asks: \"in your opinion, how do you rate the mentioned brands in the following areas?\" the chart is divided into three categories: \"all brands,\" \"ultradent,\" and \"voco,\" with the \"all brands\" category spanning 1,142 quotes, while \"ultradent\" and \"voco\" have 36 and 58 quotes, respectively. for each category, five statements are rated based on how relevant respondents consider to the brand's image: this company has a high reputation this company has products with the highest quality the company has a long-time tradition the products of this company are the easiest to use i trust this company more than others i think that it is the right company when i look for innovation i feel this company for the most customer-oriented ones i feel this company to be among the most customer-oriented ones this company supports my business development more than others the products of this company have the highest quality/price ratio each statement has a green bar indicating the percentage of respondents who rated the brand highly in each area, compared to the average (indicated by the 0% line). below the 0% line, there are red bars showing percentages below average. for \"all brands\": high reputation: 19% highest quality products: 15% long-time tradition: 15% easiest to use products: 0% i trust this company more: negative 1% right company for innovation: negative 13% customer-oriented: negative 5% supports business development: negative 13% highest quality/price ratio: negative 13% for \"ultradent\": high reputation: 28% highest quality products: 13% long-time tradition: 7% easiest to use products: negative 6% i trust this company more: negative 15% right company for innovation: negative 9% customer-oriented: negative 21% supports business development: negative 20% highest quality/price ratio: negative 6% for \"voco\": high reputation: 17% highest quality products: 7% long-time tradition: 8% easiest to use products: negative 4% i trust this company more: negative 1% right company for innovation: negative 4% customer-oriented: negative 4% supports business development: negative 12% highest quality/price ratio: negative 7% each categorization section concludes the chart with the respective categories' overall rankings in a bar graph format for easier comprehension.",
            "brand image: factor analysis map 85 focus on brands (low) customer orientation / support (high) (low) established reputation (high) if we use the coordinates given by the averages of the two factors to draw a map, we obtain the result that can be observed here on the right. the position of the brands on the map is determined by their respective averages shown in the previous graph. on the map, it is possible to notice the areas where there is a predominance in the perception of the brand regarding factor 1, customer orientation / support (x axis, quadrants on the right side of the map), and which ones are more influenced by the factor 2 established reputation (y axis, quadrants on the upper side of the map). the image contains a simplified and condensed version of a matrix originally provided in more detail on the first page, which is a part of a brand image factor analysis map. this condensed version focuses primarily on five brands: kerr, dentsply sirona, 3m, gc, and ultradent. ### detailed elements of the map: 1. **axes:** - the horizontal axis represents \"customer orientation / support,\" indicating brands that are customer-focused on the right side and less so on the left. - the vertical axis represents \"established reputation,\" with strong reputation brands on the top and weaker reputation ones on the bottom. 2. **brands plotted:** - **kerr:** positioned relatively high on the vertical axis and slightly towards the middle on the horizontal axis, indicating it has a strong established reputation and moderate customer orientation. - **dentsply sirona:** placed closer to the center, indicating a moderate reputation and orientation. - **3m:** situated almost at the middle both vertically and horizontally, suggesting a balanced standing in both respects. - **gc:** positioned lower on the vertical axis and further to the right on the horizontal axis, reflecting a lower reputation and higher customer orientation. - **ultradent:** found near the bottom-left of the grid, indicating a lower established reputation and lesser customer orientation. - **ivoclar:** marked below the main matrix grid box and positioned much lower on the vertical axis, indicating a very low perceived reputation and customer orientation, or lack of data available for it. 3. **key observations:** - brands like kerr and 3m appear to have balanced positioning, while gc seems to be somewhat at the lower end in both dimensions. - the missing placement for ivoclar suggests that it does not have sufficient data or presence relative to the other brands. - the specific placements indicate varying levels of reputation and customer-centric focus among the brands presented. 4. **text elements:** - notable textual features include the headers that identify the axes, the names of the brands, and possibly some other descriptive data points which are not clearly legible in this cropped view. 5. **colors and shapes:** - brands are represented by distinct colored dots. the main colors visible are red and black for the brands kerr, dentsply sirona, and 3m, with gc in black, and ultradent and ivoclar (if present) in a different shade. in summary, the image is a part of a comprehensive analysis comparing various brands across two significant factors - customer orientation and established reputation. although condensed, it highlights brands' standing and provides useful insights into each companys perceived attributes in the market."

using a dotted vertical line to indicate a median satisfaction value for the overall assessment of open technologies. the image contains a graph depicting molecular structures and associated numerical values. the molecular structure consists of carbon and hydrogen atoms forming a chain with double bonds indicating the presence of alkene. each molecule is represented by a unique set of numbers and symbols: the first molecular structure starts at the left and has the number values 6,8,9,7,7,8,6,78, which correspond to the atomic or molecular weights. the numbered connections represent chemical bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms, indicating their relative positions in the chain. the sequence of numbers (6, 8, 9, 7, 7, etc.) might signify weight assignments or functional group identifiers in the compound. each molecule terminates towards the right and is arranged in a continuous series, showing a systematic increase and decrease in numerical sequence, implying variations in structural isomers or functional group substitutions. the graph uses a color gradient from cyan to purple to distinguish between different values, highlighting differentiation in molecular compositions and possibly their characteristics or activities. this type of visualization could be used in scientific research for comparative analysis of molecular structures in a biological, chemical, or pharmaceutical context. the image contains a detailed graphical representation of the satisfaction levels of survey respondents concerning the features of open technologies and their overall performance. it appears to be extracted directly from the first image. the second image specifically highlights the frequency of software updates and the costs associated with these updates. it shows two sets of bar graphs positioned next to each other, each corresponding to the satisfaction levels of users on these two aspects: the left side shows the percentage of respondents who indicated various satisfaction levels for the frequency of software updates (presumably ranging from 'basically satisfied' to 'not at all satisfied' and 'no clue'). there is a noticeable distinction in satisfaction levels, with a significant number of users rating the updates as 'basically satisfied.' the percentage is divided into different sections, represented by colors ranging from yellow at least partially to green for those who are'very satisfied.' the right side shows the percentage of respondents with varying satisfaction levels concerning the costs of software updates. similar to the left side, this graph also shows different levels of satisfaction with green indicating the highest level of satisfaction. the cost aspect indicates that for a large percentage, the updates are seen as very costly, while others are quite satisfied, likely due to the perceived value and effectiveness of the updates. the data is visually laid out in a comparative format within a single panel for easy comparison. each section is neatly segmented, and the colors differentiate between levels of satisfaction, creating a clear visual hierarchy of responses.",
