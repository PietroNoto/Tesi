displays a strong green bar indicating a high positive percentage, suggesting that respondents believe the brand is forward-thinking. on the contrary, \"too expensive\" has a significantly high negative percentage (red bar), indicating a major concern or perceived issue with the brand's pricing. the second image is a zoom-in on part of this bar chart, focusing on a specific aspect related to the aforementioned categories. this zoomed-in section likely highlights the response distribution of a specific brand or category to draw more in-depth conclusions. the specific aspect covered in this section (the second image) appears to be \"innovative and at the forefront.\" the bar graph in the second image shows that the brand receives a significantly positive (green) 12% feedback on this particular aspect, with some variability as evidenced by the standard deviation indicated. it also highlights a negative (red) percentage at a significant value of -21%, implying concerns about the brand's innovation leading to less impact in other areas. overall, the image provides a concise yet thorough overview of respondents' perceptions of brand innovation and reliability, showing both positive and negative feedback clearly organized for easy comparison and analysis. the image contains a single vertical bar chart displaying data comparison across six different entities. the chart represents data pertaining to \"brand positioning: focus on totally relevant - difference from mean.\" each bar is color-coded with green above the horizontal zero line and red below it, indicating positive and negative differences from the mean, respectively. these positive and negative differences are quantitatively expressed in percentage. the chart appears to be comparing scores or feedback points associated with different aspects or attributes of brands. starting from the top: the topmost bar reaches 24% with a green bar, indicating that it is 24% points above the mean. below that is a -2% red bar, showing a 2% point difference below the mean. the next green bar is at 14%. following that, two identical red bars indicate -7% with two separate bars. the next bars are colored in green at 8%, with two separate bars each. moving down, two red bars indicate -13% and -29%, followed by one positive green bar at 14%. the final bar is notably the largest red bar at -23%. the chart is presented in a simplistic format with no additional text or details beyond the bars and their percentages, making the data visualization focused and straightforward. this design allows for quick and comparative analysis of the brands' performance relative to the overall average in the specific context. the image contains a comparison of brand positioning statements among eight companies, focusing on their relevance to customers' perceptions. the comparison is visually represented in two ways: a horizontal cluster map (left column) and a vertical bar graph (right column). each row in the horizontal map represents a different brand and the various green and red bars represent positive and negative perceptions of attributes respectively. in this context, the second segment, labeled as \"3shape,\" is represented both through the horizontal cluster map and vertical bar graph. in the horizontal cluster map for 3shape, several attributes are listed on the left side under the \"overall\" column, with corresponding horizontal bars showing the difference from the mean. notably visible are the green bar (8%) and red bar (-2%) for two attributes, with the majority of horizontal bars being very low, indicating minimal perceived differences. moving to the right side of the map, the attributes for 3shape are again listed under \"overall,\" \"zirkonzahn,\" \"exocad,\" etc. the red bar for \"too expensive\" stands out prominently at -25%, indicating a significantly higher negative perception compared to other attributes. it is also one of the few bars that extends below the 0% line, showcasing a notably negative perception for this particular attribute. the vertical bar graph provides a condensed comparison, where each brand is represented by a column of alternating green and red bars, marking positive and negative perceptions respectively. the green bar for 3shape is quite slender at 2%, while the red bars are more substantial, totaling approximately 15%. the largest and most visually striking feature is the red bar at -27%, which stands out as a significant negative perception area among the brands being compared. the graph visually segments the attributes and highlights the extreme -27% red bar in comparison to those brands' average standings. these analyses from both perspectives indicate that 3shape predominantly faces negative perceptions, particularly around the high cost factor, which is starkly represented in both the horizontal cluster map and vertical bar graph. the image contains a bar graph titled 'brand positioning: focus on \"totally relevant\"', which represents the difference in brand positioning in relation to specific attributes. this is done across different brands, with each brand's attributes rated on a scale indicated by the percentage of positive or negative responses. the attributes listed are: worldwide reknown reliable highly reputable trustworthy innovative and at the forefront makes daily practice easier recommendable to colleagues affordable leading company customer service oriented too expensive good price quality ratio the differences from the mean for each attribute for one of the brands are as follows: worldwide reknown (10%) reliable (8%) highly reputable (7%) trustworthy (4%) innovative and at the forefront (4%) makes daily practice easier (2%) recommendable to colleagues (1%) affordable (1%) leading company (1%) customer service oriented (1%) too expensive (-1%) good price quality ratio (-14%) additionally, another bar graph below shows similar data but for a different brand: worldwide reknown (10%) reliable (7%) highly reputable (7%) trustworthy (6%) innovative and at the forefront (5%) makes daily practice easier (4%) recommendable to colleagues (4%) affordable (3%) leading company (3%) customer service oriented (2%) too expensive (-11%) good price quality ratio (-15%) this analysis reflects consumers' perceptions of brand relevancy, emphasizing that certain brands are perceived to be more reliable, trustworthy, and innovative, while not meeting their expectations in terms of affordability and the balance between price and quality. the image contains a bar chart representing the \"difference from mean\" for a single category or attribute, titled \"brand positioning: focus on 'totally relevant'\". the vertical axis lists various attributes. each attribute has a percentage difference, indicated by green and red bars. 1. **worldwide known**: - green bar: 2% - red bar: 0% 2. **reliable**: - green bar: 2% - red bar: 0% 3. **highly reputable**: - green bar: 1% - red bar: -0.7% 4. **trustworthy**: - green bar: 1% - red bar: -0.3% 5. **innovative and at the forefront**: - green bar: 1% - red bar: -1% 6. **makes daily practice easier**: - green bar: 4% - red bar: -3% 7. **recommendable to colleagues**: - green bar: 3% - red bar: 0% 8. **affordable**: - green bar: 1.5% - red bar: 0% 9. **leading company**: - green bar: 14% - red bar: 4% 10. **customer service oriented**: - green bar: 17% - red bar: -10% 11. **too expensive**: - green bar: 7% - red bar: 6% 12. **good price quality ratio**: - green bar: 5% - red bar: -1% the second image, a part of the first one, shows the \"difference from mean\" for only one category - \"reliable\" on the vertical axis. here are the details for \"reliable\": *reliable**: - green bar: 2% - red bar: 0% so, in summary, the bar chart within the first image focuses on the difference from the mean for the attribute \"reliable,\" showing a positive difference of 2% (green bar

color-coded categories are defined as follows: - **product quality** (purple) - **support and assistance** (green) - **management costs** (red) - **compatibility** (yellow) 2. **chart type**: - the chart is a horizontal bar graph showing the level of satisfaction in terms of these categories, segmenting each brands performance against the mean satisfaction level (indicated by the baseline). 3. **satisfaction bar distribution**: - each brands satisfaction level for each factor is quantified and visibly represented by colored bars. - positive values (above the baseline) suggest higher satisfaction compared to the mean, while negative values represent lower satisfaction. 4. **brands analyzed** (listed on the y-axis): - **3shape** - **amann gira** - **sirona** - **dentsply** - **zirkonzahn** - **dental wings** - **zimzz - other** 5. **performance insights**: - brands such as **amann gira** show positive scores in most categories, indicating a higher satisfaction level across factors. - **sirona** also performs strongly across the categories. - in contrast, other brands like **zimzz - other** demonstrate more varied performances with some areas showing lower satisfaction. 6. **graphical representation**: - the horizontal orientation of bars allows observation of differences in satisfaction metrics across the factors and among different brands. 7. **additional annotation**: - the text at the start explains the metric values, noting that scores between -1 to +1 indicate satisfaction levels relative to the mean, with 0 being the overall average. in summary, the image provides a detailed representation of how various dental product and service providers measure up in terms of customer satisfaction across key factors, aiding in visual and quantitative comparison.",
            "overall satisfaction: factor analysis - difference from mean level of satisfaction by brand on the factors resulting from the factor analysis. + satisfaction level 108 the displayed values represent the satisfaction level of those factors, with a value ranging from -1 to +1 where 0 represents the overall mean value. for each investigated factor, the horizontal bars represent how much the satisfaction performance differs from the overall mean (vertical axis). the significant differences from the mean are marked with a red circle, so that it is possible to focus on the most interesting topics. with this regard, it is worth to note the higher than average performance of amann girrbach regarding the factor relationship and support, while it is significant the below average performance of 3shape and dental wings in the factor operating costs. the image contains a bar chart that captures the difference in satisfaction with the factors resulting from a factor analysis across different brands. the chart specifically shows the comparisons between three different brands: open technologies, 3shape, and amann girbach. there are three colors represented on the chart: green (representing performance), yellow (indicating relationship and support), and purple (depicting operating costs). the x-axis of the bar chart is labeled with the brand names open technologies, 3shape, and amann girbach while the y-axis illustrates the factors evaluated, including open technologies, 3shape, and amann girbach. the height of each bar within a given brand signifies the satisfaction level that differs from the overall mean, with the horizontal bars indicating how much the satisfaction of each factor varies from the overall mean. by observing each brand, we see several key details: 1. **open technologies**: - performance has a relatively high satisfaction value (above the midpoint). - relationship and support has a low satisfaction (beneath the bottom half), indicated by the green bar which reaches deeper compared to the others. - operating costs have a satisfyingly lower level, close to the negative axis boundary (purple). 2. **3shape**: - again, performance (green bar) shows a higher satisfaction compared to the others for this brand. - relationship and support are lower, like with open technologies, but it shows a slight higher trend from the previous brand. - operating costs are again near the bottom but better than open technologies. 3. **amann girbach**: - performance shows a high satisfaction level comparable to 3shape and open technologies. - relationship and support are the lowest among all brands and categories, even lower than open technologies and 3shape. - operating costs reach a higher point than open technologies and 3shape. the visual representation helps to see the relative strengths and weaknesses of each brands factors in customer satisfaction. specifically, while performance factors are relatively higher across the board, amann girbach has the poorest performance in the factor of relationship and support, pointing to areas for improvement in this category for this brand. the image contains a bar chart titled overall satisfaction: factor analysis difference from mean which visualizes the level of satisfaction by brand on the factors resulting from the factor analysis. the chart on the page specifies three main factors that contribute to brand satisfaction, indicated by different colors: 1. **performance**: represented by the purple bars. 2. **relationship and support**: represented by the green bars. 3. **operating costs**: represented by the orange bars. each brand's satisfaction level for these factors is depicted through horizontal bars. for example, \"open technologies\" is illustrated with one horizontal bar for each factor, measuring how much they perform in relation to the overall mean. the mean is indicated along the vertical axis with the overall mean value set at values above 0 signify a difference from the mean above the zero line, and values below 0 are below the zero line. key points from the bar chart include: amann girrbach is noted to have a higher than average performance regarding the factor relationship and support, while having sub-average performance in operating costs. 3shape and dental wings show positive performance differences above the mean but vary differently across the factors. overall, the chart aims to provide a visual comparative analysis of how closely each brands satisfaction levels match or diverge from the mean, with specific attention directed towards the most pressing or interesting areas. additionally, the image includes a legend in the bottom left corner to distinguish the different factors: **performance**: purple **relationship and support**: green **operating costs**: orange annotations, such as highlighted red circles showing significant differences from the mean, also help emphasize notable trends and insights. overall, this visual report aids in highlighting distinct brand performance strengths and weaknesses regarding satisfaction through a clear, color-coded bar chart presentation."
