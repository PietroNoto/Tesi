(scores from 1 completely unsatisfied to 10 completely satisfied) open technologies overall open technologies (50 quotes) mean 80 overall brands (538 quotes) the image contains a section of a two-dimensional bar chart titled \"satisfaction score: overall brands vs. open technologies.\" it compares user satisfaction scores from two groups: users of overall brands and users of open technologies. the chart is segmented into two columns: one for overall brands and another for open technologies, each with detailed responses from 538 overall brand users and 50 open technology users. satisfaction is evaluated on a scale from 1 to 10, with five rating categories: \"i can not judge,\" \"not satisfied,\" \"rather satisfied,\" \"very satisfied,\" and \"open technologies\" as a separate category. the chart is visually divided into two main sections, each showing 13 different aspects on which satisfaction is measured. the aspects listed from left to right are: makes daily practice easier accuracy and overall quality of the restorations reliability productivity increase handiness/ease of use technical support from the company wide-range of procedures available wide range of materials available company availability and flexibility technical assistance in case of repair compatibility with other brands overall running costs start-up training business development support frequency of sw updates from the company cost of sw updates overall satisfaction each aspect is represented by a horizontal bar for both the overall brand users and open technology users. the lengths of the bars indicate the percentage of users who rated their satisfaction in each category. the colors vary from dark to light to represent different satisfaction levels: dark represents \"very satisfied,\" medium represents \"rather satisfied,\" and light represents \"not satisfied.\" the colors are as follows: dark yellow/gold for \"very satisfied\" light orange for \"rather satisfied\" pale yellow for \"not satisfied\" the overall satisfaction score is displayed as a circular chart at the bottom with the mean scores of open technologies and the overall average, showing that the mean satisfaction score is 7.9 for open technology users and averaged overall is 7. here is a detailed breakdown of the chart for the aspects: **makes daily practice easier**: both overall brand (29% very satisfied, 44% rather satisfied) and open technology (41% very satisfied, 36% rather satisfied) respondents reported a fairly high level of satisfaction. **accuracy and overall quality of the restorations**: lower satisfaction here, particularly for open technology users. **reliability**: similarly, lower satisfaction, with open technology users reporting slightly higher satisfaction. **productivity increase**: both groups report a moderate level of satisfaction. **handiness/ease of use**: both groups report high levels of satisfaction. **technical support from the company**: open technology users report much lower satisfaction compared to overall brands. **wide range of procedures available**: overall brands and open technologies report similar levels of satisfaction. **wide range of materials available**: open technology users report slightly higher satisfaction. **company availability and flexibility**: both users report a higher level of satisfaction. **technical assistance in case of repair**: slightly varying but overall slightly higher for open technology users. **compatibility with other brands**: overall brand users report significantly higher satisfaction. **overall running costs**: open technology users report higher overall satisfaction. **start-up training**: again, higher satisfaction for open technology users. **business development support**: overall brand users report a substantial increase. **frequency of sw updates from the company**: both groups report quite similar rates of satisfaction for having software updates. **cost of sw updates**: open technology users express higher levels of satisfaction compared to overall brands. **overall satisfaction**: mean score for open technologies is slightly higher than the overall average. each individual aspects bars are plotted in a visually engaging layout, allowing a clear comparison between the satisfaction levels of users under both categories, which is intended to provide insightful data points that can be utilized for further analysis and decision-making. the image shows a circular diagram representing a graph or a bar plot, but the representation is peculiar and somewhat artistic. each 'bar' seems to be composed of multiple circular elements arranged around a central point forming a ring. each of these circles has a numerical value labeled next to it, ranging from 6.1 to 8.1, depicted in different shades of blue and gray. the circles appear to be densely packed and are layered, implying perhaps variations or categories within each individual data point. the arrangement and design is visually complex and modernistic, contributing to a clear understanding of the data distribution presented. the image contains two main sections labeled \"overall brands\" and \"open technologies,\" with each detailing percentages that represent user satisfaction scores about different factors related to cad-cam brands. each section is accompanied by a legend that maps color coding to different degrees of satisfaction. under \"overall brands,\" there are 538 quotes with ratings ranging from 'not satisfied' at 0% to 'very satisfied' at 43%. the percentages across all factors are generally higher across all categories except in a few areas where ratios are closer to the middle of the spectrum. under \"open technologies,\" there are 50 quotes with ratings similarly ranging from 'not satisfied' to 'very satisfied,' though the ratios appear generally higher for the \"open technologies\" category across several factors compared to \"overall brands.\" the highest satisfaction percentages in this section are also reflected in the overall mean scores provided at the bottom of the image. each factor is detailed and ranked with percentage scores, illustrating elements such as the ease of daily practice, the accuracy of restorations, reliability, productivity increase,-handiness, technical support, range of procedures and materials, company flexibility, technical assistance in repair, compatibility with other brands, overall running costs, startup training, business development support, frequency of sw updates, cost of sw updates, and overall satisfaction. the scores reflect the user experience and satisfaction with these different facets offered by both brand names.",

printing in dentistry is from uk, like it happened in the sample of dentists. the second image displays a bar chart titled \"3d printing awareness\" comparing the awareness level of three-dimensional printing technology among dentists across various countries. the x-axis represents different countries (abbreviated as de, fr, it, sp, uk, which stand for germany, france, italy, spain, and the united kingdom, respectively), and the y-axis represents the percentage of awareness, ranging from 0% to 100%. the chart includes two pairs of bars for each country: the lighter blue bar represents the percentage of dentists who are aware of 3d printing technology. the gray bar represents the percentage of dentists who are aware of the availability of 3d printing technology specifically in dentistry. for each country, the following observations can be made: germany (de): 100% of dentists are aware of 3d printing general technology, whereas 92% are aware of its use in dentistry. france (fr): 100% awareness of 3d printing technology; 16% awareness of 3d printing in dentistry. italy (it): 84% aware of general 3d printing technology; 18% aware of 3d printing in dentistry. spain (sp): 82% aware of 3d printing technology; 18% aware of 3d printing in dentistry. united kingdom (uk): 79% aware of 3d printing technology; 21% aware of 3d printing in dentistry. this visualization helps in understanding the disparity between the general awareness of 3d printing technology and its specific application in dentistry among dentists across different european countries. the image contains a pie chart labeled \"no\" with 8% of the pie colored gray and the rest labeled \"yes\" with 92% colored white. the chart is set against a plain background with no additional annotations or text. the chart specifically represents a statistic or survey result concerning a yes-or-no question regarding 3d printing technology awareness among a surveyed group. the significant majority, 92%, are identified as being aware of the technology whereas a smaller segment, 8%, are not aware. this pie chart is placed towards the bottom left of an infographic, with the heading \"are you aware of the 3d printing technology?\" placed above it for context, indicating that it's a component of a larger survey or study addressing technological awareness. the image contains four distinct bar graphs arranged in two columns, indicating various percentages for different countries and a segment of those bar graphs colored differently from the others. from left to right, starting with the first column: the first bar is fully colored in blue, with 100% written above it. this suggests that all participants in this segment were aware of 3d printing technology. the first bar in the second set is colored in purple with 18% written below it. this indicates that 18% of the respondents were not aware of 3d printing technology, contrasting with the fully colored blue bar above it which signifies full awareness. the third bar is also blue but now labeled with 23%, which could imply a gap or a continuation in percentage understanding of 3d printing awareness compared to the column on the left, where all represented in blue. the right column: the first bar is in a vivid blue with 82% written, showing similar awareness. the second bar is purple and indicates 12%, suggesting 12% are not aware of 3d printing technology, again in contrast with the fully blue bars above them. the third bar is also blue with 88% written, consistent with the first column for the same awareness level. the fourth bar is more striking in its deep purple as it only shows 4% unaware, with 96% fully aware, making the lowest percentage of unawareness among the presented categories, potentially highlighting a unique situation or understanding within that particular group. the base notation indicates that 722 cases were used as a base for this data collection, showing the sample size's significance for the study. the image is from page 22 indicated at its lower right corner and its associated with a publication by omnivision digital and key-stone. the combination of these bar graphs with different colors and percentages effectively contrasts and illustrates varying levels of 3d printing awareness among different populations or subgroups, underscoring how general 3d print awareness diverges in dental environments versus general awareness. the image contains two similar pie charts, both depicting the level of awareness regarding 3d printing technology. the key differences between the two charts lie in the types of questions they cover and the specific details for two countries - germany (de) and the united kingdom (uk). at the top-left corner of the image, it poses a question: are you aware of the 3d printing technology? below this, there is a pie chart representing the responses from germany (de) and the united kingdom (uk). the pie chart shows: yes (93%): represented by a large blue segment indicating the proportion of respondents who are aware of 3d printing technology. no (7%): represented by a small purple segment indicating the proportion of respondents who are not aware. at the top-right corner of the image, there is another question: are you aware of the availability of 3d printing technology in dentistry as well? below this question, there is another pie chart representing the responses from germany (de) and the united kingdom (uk). this pie chart shows: yes (92%): a large blue segment, slightly smaller than the yes segment from the first question. no (8%): a small purple segment. beneath these two pie charts is an explanatory note stating: \"3d printing awareness generally is higher among technicians than among dentists, and again the lowest grade of awareness about the availability of 3d printing in dentistry is from uk, like it happened in the sample of dentists.\" in summary, the pie charts in the first image provide a comparative view of the awareness levels regarding 3d printing technology and its availability in dentistry across two specific regions germany (de) and the united kingdom (uk). the charts highlight a high level of awareness regarding the technology but suggest varying degrees of awareness regarding its application particularly in dentistry, with the uk showing lower awareness. both charts clearly demonstrate these trends

4% increased slightly - 37% stable - 38% decreased slightly - 17% decreased a lot - 3% the chart is a horizontal bar graph with each bar representing the percentage of different perceptions of the current business situation. the bars and their corresponding labels are color-coded, with darker colors representing a higher percentage of respondents. #### observations: the largest segment appears to be \"stable\" at 38%, indicating that almost 40% of respondents believe the current business situation has remained unchanged over the past 12 months. the next two major perceptions are \"increased slightly\" with 37% and \"increased a lot\" with 4%. \"decreased slightly\" and \"decreased a lot\" are significantly lower at 17% and 3% respectively. ### perception about the future *categories**: it will increase a lot - 6% it will increase slightly - 32% it will remain stable - 54% it will decrease slightly - 6% it will decrease a lot - 1% this analysis also uses a horizontal bar chart to show perceptions of the future of business over the same period. similar to the first chart, bars and colors are used to visualize this data. #### observations: the most common response is that the business situation will \"remain stable\" with 54%, showcasing high confidence levels in maintaining current conditions into the future. \"increase slightly\" and \"increase a lot\" received moderate responses at 32% and 6%, respectively. \"decrease slightly\" and \"decrease a lot\" are the least selected options, garnering 6% and 1% of the responses. ### coherent analysis comparing the two sets of data, there are notable differences and trends: 1. **current condition vs. future trend**: - a large number of respondents (36%) view their current situation as either improving slightly or improving a lot. this suggests optimism about recent changes or improvements. - conversely, the majority (54%) do not anticipate a substantial change (either increase/decrease a lot or decrease slightly) in the future, underscoring a belief in stability or a mild increase. 2. **stability in perception**: - there is a notable stability factor in both categories, with 38% of responses for current situation perception and 54% for future situation perception. 3. **moderate change expectations**: - a moderate but significant portion (37%) expect at least a slightly positive change going forward, which is echoed by their perception of the present business conditions. 4. **underconfidence in decreases**: - less than 10% of respondents anticipate larger negative changes in either their current or future business situation, indicating a general confidence in avoiding significant declines. this detailed analysis of both charts indicates a pattern of cautious optimism with a preference for stability, where current improvements are believed to continue, albeit not in large measures. the image contains a bar chart titled \"analysis of confidence: perception of current situation vs. perception of the future.\" it provides a comparison between how respondents perceive the current situation versus their forecast for the future. the sample for the data is noted as 588 cases (whole sample). the chart also gives a brief overview of the data evaluation method stating that it involves a comparison between the perception of the situation over the last 12 months and the forecast. specifically, the chart details respondents' beliefs about the future situation as follows: the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"increase a lot\" is 6%. this is visually represented by a green bar. the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"increase slightly\" is 32%. it is depicted with a light green bar. the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"remain stable\" is 54%. this is clearly highlighted by the yellow bar occupying the most space in the chart. the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"decrease slightly\" is 6%. this is depicted by an orange bar. the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"decrease a lot\" is 1%. this is visualized by the shortest red bar at the bottom of the chart. this comparison illustrates that a significantly higher proportion of respondents (54%) expects the future situation to remain stable, followed by those who think there will be an increase either a lot or slightly. conversely, the percentages indicating a decrease, whether slight or significant, are notably lower.",

brands, providing a clear visual comparison of how each brand has fared historically and in the current market. the abandonment rate graphically underlines the transition rate of consumers and practices within this sector. the chart makes use of varying shades of blue to differentiate between historical and current data. each section includes a numerical score at the right side, adding another level of quantitative information for analysis purposes. the inclusion of both abandonment and penetration rates allows for a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics in the dental industry, highlighting how brands are maintaining their market share and attracting new adopters. the image contains a line graph situated within the context of a detailed analysis on product penetration and abandonment rates as indicated by the surrounding text in the first image. the graph depicts data points representing both the absorption rate and the current penetration of the products from different brands. the specific content of the graph includes a series of discrete data points along a horizontal axis that represents the percentage ranges of product utilization or penetration, indicated by the red line. at the top of the horizontal axis, values range from 0 to approximately 0.47, suggesting that the penetration rates presented are fractions between 0 and 0. each data point is connected by straight segments forming a line, showing how the average absorption rate of different products changes over time or some other measured dimension. these points indicate the trend of product usage, where higher points signify higher penetration, and lower points signify lower penetration. the data representation in the graph implies a step-by-step increase in penetration to near a plateau, with a slight increase at the end. key data points include: starting with lower absorption rates around 0.22 towards 0.28. a transition period between 0.28 and 0.36, signifying a moderate increase. an uptick between 0.36 and 0.48, showing a significant rise. a plateau period, indicating continued high absorption close to 0.50. lastly, a slight increase to 0.47, showing a slight drop or variability in the later stages. the overall trend suggests consistent improvement in absorption of the products, followed by stabilization, likely reflecting market saturation or increased consumer engagement. the graph's red line provides a clear visual cue for the changes in product utilization, facilitating easy interpretation of the data. this specific graphical tool is designed to highlight the changes and trends in the measured variable over the sample period represented.",

**utilizamos impresión 3d** (we use 3d printing) - these individuals use 3d printing and most likely utilize it in their daily practice. 2. **light blue bars**: - **lo usamos ocasionalmente en el pasado, pero ya no lo hacemos** (we used it occasionally in the past, but no longer do it) - these individuals occasionally used 3d printing in the past, but it is not a current practice. 3. **purple bars**: - **estoy familiarizado con sus beneficios y usos, pero nunca lo probe** (i am familiar with its benefits and uses, but have never tried it) - these individuals are aware of the benefits and uses of 3d printing, but they have not personally tried it. 4. **gray bars**: - **conozco la impresión en 3d pero no estoy familiarizado con sus beneficios y usos** (i know about 3d printing but am not familiar with its benefits and uses) - while aware of 3d printing, these individuals are not familiar with its advantages or common applications. 5. **sandy beige bars**: - **nunca escuche de eso** (i have never heard of it) - these individuals have not come across or heard of 3d printing. each of these codes helps to classify the responses of clinicians and laboratories in the first image. the image contains a donut chart showing the concordance and usage of 3d imaging in clinical and laboratory settings. it is presented within a larger context of text and infographics. the particular focus here is the donut chart detailing the responses from clinical settings. the donut chart is labeled \"clinicas,\" indicating data from clinic-based responses. it illustrates three key statistics using different shades and colors: 1. **39%** - represented in light blue/blue segment, signifying clinicians who use 3d imaging as a tool. 2. **36%** - shown in dark blue, referring to clinicians who occasionally use or do not use 3d imaging. 3. **12%** - indicated in navy blue/purple for clinicians who are not familiar with 3d imaging. 4. **1%** - the smallest segment, in dark gray, which represents clinicians who do not use 3d imaging and are unlikely to change their stance. the text surrounding the chart and accompanying images emphasize factors influencing the adoption of 3d imaging in medical practice, particularly in clinical and laboratory environments. the overall message is to highlight the varying degrees of familiarity, usage, and adoption rates of 3d imaging among clinicians.",

            "3d printing awareness and use which statement regarding 3d printing in dentistry applies to you? 34 1% owners 99% non-owners despite quite some practices providing customized devices made up from 3d printers (as showed in the following slide), only 1% declare to own a 3d printer in the surgery. rather new but rapidly increasing, 3d printing looks to be well know as to be a digital technology available for dentistry as well: only a very small portion of the respondents declare not to be aware of it (4%). 3d printing seems to be more widely used among less young dentists and big sized surgeries. base: 282 cases (whole sample) the image contains a pie chart with sections representing different percentages related to 3d printing awareness and use in dentistry. there are four main sections, each color-coded and labeled with corresponding percentages: 1. **deep blue section (48%):** this largest section, shaded in a deep blue, denotes \"we use 3d printing at our practice.\" it represents the highest percentage of respondents who have implemented 3d printing in their dental practices. 2. **light blue section (47%):** the next major section, in a lighter blue, represents \"i am familiar with its benefits and uses, but never tried it (awareness).\" this section indicates that respondents understand the potential of 3d printing but have not yet utilized it in their practices. 3. **gray section (4%):** this smaller section, shaded in gray, states \"i am aware of 3d printing, but not familiar with its benefits and uses (awareness).\" this represents a small group of respondents who are generally aware of 3d printing but lack specific knowledge about its applications in dentistry. 4. **very slight blue section (1%):** the smallest section, shaded in a very light blue, indicates \"never heard of it.\" this portion signifies a small fraction of respondents who are not aware of 3d printing at all. on the right side of the pie chart, there is a vertical percentage scale showing that 1% own a 3d printer in their surgeries, specifically noted for young dentists and bigger surgeries. furthermore, the text accompanying the pie chart highlights various points: despite some practices providing customized devices made from 3d printers, only 1% own their own. among 3d printing technology, only 4% of respondents declare to be aware of it. young dentists and larger surgeries report more frequently the usage of 3d printing. the base note at the bottom left of the image states, \"base: 282 cases (whole sample),\" suggesting that the survey includes all respondent cases, totaling the overall layout is neat and clean, with the text providing clear context about the usage statistics of 3d printing in dentistry. the image contains a smaller inset chart located towards the bottom of the larger data visualization page, which appears to be a part of a report or presentation on 3d printing awareness and usage. the inset chart utilizes a pie chart to illustrate a group of responses related to the adoption and familiarity with 3d printing in a dental practice setting. each segment of the pie chart corresponds to a specific category, represented by distinct colors. **we use 3d printing at our practice**: this is shown in blue, constituting 48% of the pie chart. **i am familiar with its benefits and uses, but never tried it (awareness)**: represented in light blue, this category comprises 47% of the total. **i am aware of 3d printing, but not familiar with its benefits and uses (awareness)**: indicated in grey, accounts for 4% of the pie chart. **never heard of it**: shown in dark blue, this segment makes up the remaining 1%. below the pie chart is a bracket that provides a visual representation of the percentage figures, aligning with the segments of the pie and confirming the data percentages. adjacent to the pie chart is a brief explanatory note regarding the data. the note reads as follows: \"despite quite some practices providing customized devices made up from 3d printers (as shown in the following slide), only 1% declare to own a 3d printer in the surgery. rather new but rapidly increasing, 3d printing looks to be well know as to be a digital technology available for dentistry as well: only a very small portion of the respondents declare not to be aware of it (4%), 3d printing seems to be more widely used among less young dentists and big sized surgeries.\" this summary provides an insight that suggests while 1% have a 3d printer, there is a broad awareness (96% aware and 4% unaware of 3d printing) among the dental practitioners, which underscores the rapid uptake of the technology. it further highlights a possible generational trend where 3d printing is more prevalent among older practitioners and larger surgical practices. to the right of the chart, a legend in text format specifies the color code associated with each segment of the pie chart for reader reference. this includes: **1% owners** (denotes the light blue segment) **99% non-owners** (denotes the dark blue segment) this concise inclusion offers an at-a-glance understanding of 3d printing adoption and awareness levels in dental practices. the source and base sample number is cited below the pie chart, indicating 282 cases, which suggests the data spans a large enough population to offer meaningful insights into dental practitioners' familiarity and usage of 3d printing. *concluding observation**: the image, as a whole, thus portrays a snapshot of the rapid technological adoption in dentistry, notably the early stages of integrating 3d printing into dental practices, reflected by the significant awareness levels but a notably lesser share who can claim having a printing device, with a hint at its growing influence especially among a specialized demographic within the dental field.",

            "role of impression materials 97 the results of this question are very interesting as it appears that traditional impression materials will continue to be widely used within the dental practice, despite the rapid adoption of the digital workflow. only 10% of the sample states that traditional impression materials will be completely replaced by optical impressions, and over 40% of the sample believes that the use of traditional impression materials will not decrease significantly. how will the use of precision impression materials like elastomers (a silicones, polyethers, etc.) evolve in your practice? base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) the image contains a pie chart representing data from a survey conducted by brandequity in collaboration with key.stone. the primary focus of the survey is the \"role of impression materials\" in the dental practice, specifically examining how practitioners use materials like elastomers (silicones, polyethers) and other similar substances. the pie chart provides a visual summary of the survey results across different countries or regions represented in the sample of 1,018 cases. the title of the chart, \"role of impression materials,\" is clearly visible, followed by the subquery \"how will the use of precision impression materials like elastomers (a silicones, polyethers, etc.) evolve in your practice?\". the chart has three primary colors indicating different responses: dark blue (41%): respondents who believe the traditional impression materials will be used for certain indications and will still play a significant role over time. light blue (49%): respondents who believe traditional impression materials will only be used for certain indications and will gradually fulfill a marginal role. bright blue (10%): respondents who believe traditional impression materials will be completely replaced by optical impressions. below the pie chart, the data is explained in a paragraph that clarifies the interpretations of the colors: 49% of respondents hold the belief that traditional impression materials will continue to be used widely in the dental practice, despite the rising use of digital techniques. 10% suggest that traditional materials might be completely replaced by optical impressions over time. over 40% of the sample group strongly stands by the notion that traditional impression materials will not significantly decrease in their use. this detailed interpretation emphasizes the continued reliance on traditional impression materials in the dental industry, despite the push towards digital advancements. the chart and accompanying commentary provide valuable insights into the evolving practices of dental practitioners around the world. the image contains a bar chart visually representing the usage of traditional impression materials in various dental practices across different countries. the bar chart is split into three categories, each delineating how practitioners use traditional impression materials along with indicating whether they will continue to use them, be replaced by optical impressions, or only used for indications. the three key segments within the chart are: 1. **usage of traditional impression materials:** - the blue portion represents the percentage of respondents who still use traditional impression materials (silicones, polyethers, etc.). this is the majority percentage in each chart. 2. **continued use post-adoption of optical technologies:** - the turquoise portion depicts those who suggest they will continue to use traditional materials, even if optical impressions become widely adopted. 3. **replacement by optical technologies:** - an even smaller green portion illustrates the percentage of respondents who expect traditional materials will be completely replaced by optical impressions. the data points provide insights into the usage of traditional impression materials by country: **france:** 49% continue traditional use, 11% will transition post-adoption, 41% expect complete replacement by optical. **germany:** 47% continue, 7% will transition, 46% expected complete replacement. **italy:** 53% continue, 8% will transition, 40% expect complete replacement. **spain:** 51% continue, 10% will transition, 39% expect complete replacement. **uk:** 49% continue, 20% will transition, 31% expect complete replacement. each bars split sections visually demonstrate this distribution, enabling a clear comparative analysis in terms of both current usage and future adoption trends among these countries regarding impression materials. the image contains text detailing the responses from various sources regarding the usage of traditional impression materials in dental practices, specifically focusing on the replacement or persistence of them by new optical impression technologies. the first image displayed is a compilation of bar graphs representing the responses from five different countries: france, germany, italy, spain, and the uk. the bars are color-coded to indicate the percentage of respondents who believe that traditional impression materials will either be entirely replaced, only used for specific indications and play a marginal role over time, or continue to be used for certain indications without being significantly diminished in importance. the bar graphs convey the following: **france**: 41% believe in total replacement, 49% believe they will only be used for certain indications and play a marginal role over time, and 10% believe they will continue to be used without significant decrease. **germany**: 46% believe they will only be used for certain indications and play a marginal role over time, 41% believe in total replacement, and 11% believe they will continue to be used. **italy**: 53% believe in total replacement, 41% believe they will only be used for certain indications and play a marginal role over time, and 6% believe they will continue to be used. **spain**: 51% believe they will only be used for certain indications over time, 37% believe in total replacement, and 12% believe they will continue to be used. **uk**: 40% believe in total replacement, 53% believe they will only be used for certain indications and play a marginal role over time, and 7% believe they will continue to be used. below the bar graphs, there is an analysis that highlights some interesting insights derived from the survey question: \"how will the use of precession impression materials like elastomers (a silicons, polyethers, etc.) evolve in your practice?\" a substantial majority (over 40%) of respondents still think that traditional impression materials will continue to be widely used in dental practices despite the growing trend towards digital solutions. only a minority (10%) anticipates full replacement of traditional materials by optical impressions. this suggests a mixed scenario in which traditional technologies might coexist with new digital technologies rather than being completely replaced. in the second image, these details and interpretations are summarized with three bullet points: 1. \"they will be completely replaced by optical impressions\" represented by the color green in the first image. 2. \"they will only be used for certain indications, and over time they will play a marginal role\" represented by the color teal in the first image. 3. \"we will continue to use them for certain indications, and they will not decrease significantly\" represented by the color dark blue in the first image. the overall message reinforced by both images is that while traditional impression materials are not being abandoned wholesale and are expected to maintain some relevance, changes towards optical impressions are anticipated in many dental practices.",

this response indicates a belief that despite technological advancements, the fundamental roles of individuals in the field will remain unchanged due to inherent differences in expertise and responsibilities. 2. **the cooperation between dentists and technicians will increase because the knowledge of the technician in prosthetics materials, esthetics and digital processing are important** - this option suggests that the integration between dentists and technicians will grow, primarily driven by an appreciation and necessity for the specialized knowledge that technicians possess, especially in the areas of prosthetics materials, esthetics, and digital processing. 3. **the dentists will need to get more expertise about prosthetics**, because they will be required to perform part of the work in charge of technicians this answer implies a shift towards dentists needing to possess more expertise in prosthetics themselves, possibly reflecting a trend toward dentists taking over more duties traditionally handled by technicians. 4. **dont know** - this response signifies uncertainty or a lack of clear understanding about how roles might change or evolve with new digital technologies in the dental profession. these responses collectively represent a spectrum of viewpoints ranging from resistant to change (believing that individual roles will remain distinct) to an anticipation of increased collaboration and broader skill sets. this context, when aligned with the accompanying pie chart and additional data from the first image, offers a comprehensive view into the diverse perceptions and expectations regarding the impact of new digital technologies on the roles of dentists and technicians.",
            "scenario: change in the relationship among dentists, technicians, industry how do you think the relationship between dentists and technicians and the industry will change with the new digital technologies? 27 base: 1000 cases the major part of the quotes are in the direction of a tighter cooperation between dentists and technicians and between dentists and the industry, due to the increasing need for specific manufactured products that the manufacturers can provide. this stance is rather even among countries, with spain showing a higher feeling about the increase in the cooperation between dentists and the industry. the image contains a circular pie chart labeled beneath the text \"de esp\" in the top right corner and \"country\" in the middle. the pie chart's background color is white, and it is divided into five segments, each representing a different percentage of responses to a survey question. the segment colors are blue, dark blue, gray, and two shades of blue that are lighter and darker than the others. starting from the top right segment, the pie chart displays the following segments with their respective percentages: the light blue segment is the largest, taking up 35% of the pie chart. the dark blue segment is the next largest, making up 34%. the gray segment is the smallest, comprising only 7% of the pie chart. the darkest blue segment is 34%, but it is not segmented into two smaller portions by the legend, suggesting that the largest segment (35%) includes other categories not specified. the legend at the bottom explains the data with three primary statements: the relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing. the relationship will become blander because the cad processing will be even easier and it does not require specific expertise from the dentists. the relationship with the industry will become tighter because of the need for case-specific manufactured products and services. the overall chart conveys that, out of the surveyed group, 35% believe the relationship will tighten due to high specialization on specific tasks, 34% think it will tighten because of industry-specific product needs, and 7% think it will become blander due to easier cad processing. the largest portion, representing 35%, falls into the category of tighter relationships, illustrating a significant majority opinion on the matter. the image contains a bar chart titled \"scenario: change in the relationship among dentists, technicians, and industry.\" it illustrates how respondents believe digital technology will affect the relationship among dentists, technicians, and the industry, with data divided by countries. the vertical axis on the left indicates the response categories. three categories are color-coded and listed as follows: a blue rectangle representing \"the relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing,\" labeled as category a. a blue and grey rectangle representing \"the relationship will become blander because the cad processing will be easier and it does not require specific expertise from the dentists,\" labeled as category b. a grey rectangle representing \"don't know,\" labeled as c. on the right side, a legend correlates each color to its respective category: the smallest gray rectangle is 7% the medium blue rectangle is 25% the largest blue rectangle is 36% the medium grey rectangle is 33% a smaller blue rectangle is 9% a medium blue rectangle is 40% a dark blue rectangle is 49% the smallest light blue rectangle is 26% the smallest dark blue rectangle is 12% the smallest blue and grey rectangle is 22% the smallest dark blue rectangle is 6% the smallest light blue rectangle is 34% the smallest blue rectangle is 50% the smallest light blue rectangle is 1% in each country section, these bar segments summarize the percentage of respondents who believe the relationship will tighten or blander (a or b) and those who answered \"don't know.\" specifically, the countries shown, from left to right, are \"de,\" \"fr,\" \"it,\" \"sp,\" and \"uk\": de: 36% tighten, 25% blander, 33% don't know fr: 37% tighten, 26% blander, 27% don't know it: 40% tighten, 49% blander, 12% dont know sp: 49% tighten, 47% blander, 12% dont know uk: 27% tighten, 50% blander, 22% dont know the overall chart aims to convey the impact of digital technologies on professional dynamics within the dental industry, comparing perceptions across different european countries. the image displays a textual enumeration of survey responses, specifically focusing on the expected changes in relationships between dentists, technicians, and the industry in response to the introduction of new digital technologies. the primary question asks: \"how do you think the relationship between dentists and technicians and the industry will change with the new digital technologies?\" below the question, there are four primary categories for responses, each represented by a different colored dot: 1. **blue dot**: indicates respondents who believe the relationship will become tighter primarily due to the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad (computer-aided design) processing. 2. **gray dot**: represents respondents who think the relationship will become blander because cad processing will become even easier and not require specific expertise from dentists. 3. **red dot**: depicts respondents who anticipate the industry relationship will become tighter due to the increased need for specific manufactured products and services. 4. **light blue dot**: represents respondents who chose 'dont know' and left the category blank or did not select this option in favor of the above categories. the corresponding responses from this list appear to be organized by country, though the full context isnt explicitly provided. its likely that each country's data is categorized by place or respondent type, which is a common format for international surveys to allow for comparative analyses. the overall layout is concise and informative, aiming to present the varied responses clearly and quickly while ensuring the data is visually accessible. the inclusion of 'don't know' adds a layer of uncertainty to the analysis, which is valuable for any interpretation of public opinion and industry trends.",

            "intention to buy: chairside cad-cam milling unit are you willing to purchase a chairside cad-cam milling unit within 2 years? if yes, what brand(s) are you going to consider for purchase? non-owners 65 base: 268 cases base: 22 cases intention to buy intention to buy 3 or more dental units (18%) 1 practicing dentist (2%) 3 or more practicing dentists (19%) due to the lower number of cases, these figures should be taken as an indication only. for this reason the chart shows the ranking of the mentioned brands, without indication of the percentage. clinic the image contains a horizontal bar chart depicting preferences among dental professionals in regards to their intention to purchase a chairside cad-cam milling unit. the data is categorized by two variables: the dental professional units (three or more) and the number of practicing dentists. the bar chart ranks dental brands by the percentage of respondents within each category. in the first category, based on professional involvement with dental units (three or more), the brand \"dentsply sirona\" leads with a significant percentage, showing dominance in the targeted group. this suggests that a substantial number of dental professionals with three or more dental units prefer dentsply sirona units for their chairside cad-cam milling capability. the second category considers dentists who practice their profession more extensively. in this category, \"dentsply sirona\" also leads, although not as prominently as in the first category. this indicates that extended practice professionals have a notable inclination towards dentsply sirona solutions for their chairside cad-cam milling unit needs. comparing these data with brands like \"kavo,\" \"straumann,\" and \"3shape,\" it is evident that dentsply sirona stands out in both specialized categories of dental equipment users. the bar chart also shows a segment for respondents who do not know the answer or did not provide an answer, taking up a substantial percentage, indicating ambiguity or lack of awareness in some respondents. overall, the chart conveys that dentsply sirona is a leading choice among dental professionals, particularly among those running multiple dental units or those who practice extensively. the substantial share of don't know/no answer responses suggest a potential area for market engagement and information dissemination. the image contains a circular pie chart divided into two segments representing the survey responses for \"is it your intention to buy a chairside cad-cam milling unit within the next 2 years?\" only 8% of respondents answered \"yes,\" while 92% answered \"no.\" the chart's small segment colored in purple clearly identifies the \"yes\" portion, contrasting starkly with the much larger section filled in blue for \"no.\" the title \"non-owners\" suggests that the responses are from individuals who do not currently own the specific chairside cad-cam milling unit. the right side of the image features a vertical list of seven brands: dentspply sirona, kavo, straumann, 3shape, and roland, each accompanied by a blue bar indicating their respective levels of considerations among the respondents. however, because of the low number of cases (22), the percentages for these brands are not displayed. a small bar indicates there are \"don't know / no answer\" cases as well. the overall design, including the omnivision digital watermark and key-stone logo, places it within a clinical or dental professional context for survey results analysis.",
            "some conclusions 73 the aspects of costs are relevant in the pre-sale, but they do not show to be relevant after the equipment purchase and possible repurchase almost 50% of the sample feels uncomfortable and away from the cad-cam world, specially those who have patients of middle/low classes and with low volume of procedures. regardless the 50% that claim to be away from technology, only 11% claim that technology will not play an important role in the future. less than 2% of the practices in brazil have a chairside unit only about 3% of practices have an intraoral scanner. sirona is spontaneously the most known brand in the cad-cam world, but more than 80% of the sample cannot mention spontaneously a cad-cam manufacturer brand; almost half dentists claim not to know that sirona is a cad-cam manufacturer; sirona brand image in the cad-cam world is much superior between users in terms of those who know it but do not use it. it means that in the market of non-users, sirona has an image position not above the competition. in the process of recommendation to the colleagues, for cad-cam users, aspects regarding the service and proximity the client, which still seem to be in need, are much relevant; in the recommendation process, economical aspects have no weight for those who already are users. about 5% of the dentists interviewed claimed to be willing to invest in cad-cam technology in the next two years, as can be seen in the next slide.",

overall satisfaction, 50 quotes for open technologies, 30 quotes for amann girbach, and 26 quotes for 3shape. *overall (538 quotes):** the overall satisfaction category shows a negative sentiment with a percentage of (-) 11%. the majority of categories exhibit negative responses, as indicated by the predominantly red bars, which range between -2% to -11%, indicating dissatisfaction. *open technologies (50 quotes):** positive sentiment for open technologies is shown with a percentage of 16%. numerous categories have negative responses with percentages like -3%, -4%, and -11%, yet relatively, the green bars show greater positive response compared to the other companies. *amann girbach (30 quotes):** the category for \"compleely satisfied\" indicates a very positive score of 29%. the majority of the sentiment is negative with -9% in several categories, albeit the high percentage for very satisfied users signifies a high level of appreciation. *3shape (26 quotes):** a neutral sentiment is displayed with a percentage of 14%. strong negative sentiment is shown in categories such as \"-10%\" and \"-9%\", which is quite common throughout this category. the contrasting colors of red and green bar representations visually highlight the disparity in satisfaction scores across companies and categories. the data provides a detailed insight into varying user experiences with the software product, particularly emphasizing positive and negative sentiments for each of the referenced companies. the image shows a bar chart categorized by a group of technology companies. the bars are segmented into two colored categories: green (indicating positive feedback) and red (indicating negative feedback). the company or product being evaluated is identified at the bottom of the chart. there are seven bars, each representing different items rated by the respondents. the first bar at the top shows a 16% rating from the company, followed by a 9% rating. the central segment of the chart includes a 2% rating and another 2% rating, both showing moderate feedback. the bottom portion of the chart demonstrates a negative percentage, with the first one showing an 11% decrease and subsequent bars at or near -4%. it's important to note that the items listed are not clearly legible in the provided image, but given the context of a satisfaction score, they most likely pertain to customer or user satisfaction factors such as ease of use, product reliability, customer support, and overall user experience."

            "3d printing awareness and use which statement regarding 3d printing in dentistry applies to you? 34 1% owners 99% non-owners despite quite some practices providing customized devices made up from 3d printers (as showed in the following slide), only 1% declare to own a 3d printer in the surgery. rather new but rapidly increasing, 3d printing looks to be well know as to be a digital technology available for dentistry as well: only a very small portion of the respondents declare not to be aware of it (4%). 3d printing seems to be more widely used among less young dentists and big sized surgeries. base: 282 cases (whole sample) the image contains a pie chart with sections representing different percentages related to 3d printing awareness and use in dentistry. there are four main sections, each color-coded and labeled with corresponding percentages: 1. **deep blue section (48%):** this largest section, shaded in a deep blue, denotes \"we use 3d printing at our practice.\" it represents the highest percentage of respondents who have implemented 3d printing in their dental practices. 2. **light blue section (47%):** the next major section, in a lighter blue, represents \"i am familiar with its benefits and uses, but never tried it (awareness).\" this section indicates that respondents understand the potential of 3d printing but have not yet utilized it in their practices. 3. **gray section (4%):** this smaller section, shaded in gray, states \"i am aware of 3d printing, but not familiar with its benefits and uses (awareness).\" this represents a small group of respondents who are generally aware of 3d printing but lack specific knowledge about its applications in dentistry. 4. **very slight blue section (1%):** the smallest section, shaded in a very light blue, indicates \"never heard of it.\" this portion signifies a small fraction of respondents who are not aware of 3d printing at all. on the right side of the pie chart, there is a vertical percentage scale showing that 1% own a 3d printer in their surgeries, specifically noted for young dentists and bigger surgeries. furthermore, the text accompanying the pie chart highlights various points: despite some practices providing customized devices made from 3d printers, only 1% own their own. among 3d printing technology, only 4% of respondents declare to be aware of it. young dentists and larger surgeries report more frequently the usage of 3d printing. the base note at the bottom left of the image states, \"base: 282 cases (whole sample),\" suggesting that the survey includes all respondent cases, totaling the overall layout is neat and clean, with the text providing clear context about the usage statistics of 3d printing in dentistry. the image contains a smaller inset chart located towards the bottom of the larger data visualization page, which appears to be a part of a report or presentation on 3d printing awareness and usage. the inset chart utilizes a pie chart to illustrate a group of responses related to the adoption and familiarity with 3d printing in a dental practice setting. each segment of the pie chart corresponds to a specific category, represented by distinct colors. **we use 3d printing at our practice**: this is shown in blue, constituting 48% of the pie chart. **i am familiar with its benefits and uses, but never tried it (awareness)**: represented in light blue, this category comprises 47% of the total. **i am aware of 3d printing, but not familiar with its benefits and uses (awareness)**: indicated in grey, accounts for 4% of the pie chart. **never heard of it**: shown in dark blue, this segment makes up the remaining 1%. below the pie chart is a bracket that provides a visual representation of the percentage figures, aligning with the segments of the pie and confirming the data percentages. adjacent to the pie chart is a brief explanatory note regarding the data. the note reads as follows: \"despite quite some practices providing customized devices made up from 3d printers (as shown in the following slide), only 1% declare to own a 3d printer in the surgery. rather new but rapidly increasing, 3d printing looks to be well know as to be a digital technology available for dentistry as well: only a very small portion of the respondents declare not to be aware of it (4%), 3d printing seems to be more widely used among less young dentists and big sized surgeries.\" this summary provides an insight that suggests while 1% have a 3d printer, there is a broad awareness (96% aware and 4% unaware of 3d printing) among the dental practitioners, which underscores the rapid uptake of the technology. it further highlights a possible generational trend where 3d printing is more prevalent among older practitioners and larger surgical practices. to the right of the chart, a legend in text format specifies the color code associated with each segment of the pie chart for reader reference. this includes: **1% owners** (denotes the light blue segment) **99% non-owners** (denotes the dark blue segment) this concise inclusion offers an at-a-glance understanding of 3d printing adoption and awareness levels in dental practices. the source and base sample number is cited below the pie chart, indicating 282 cases, which suggests the data spans a large enough population to offer meaningful insights into dental practitioners' familiarity and usage of 3d printing. *concluding observation**: the image, as a whole, thus portrays a snapshot of the rapid technological adoption in dentistry, notably the early stages of integrating 3d printing into dental practices, reflected by the significant awareness levels but a notably lesser share who can claim having a printing device, with a hint at its growing influence especially among a specialized demographic within the dental field."
