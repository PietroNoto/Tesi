likely pertains to the focus on \"totally relevant\" and \"difference from mean.\" - the chart originates from omnivision digitals, a digital marketing analytics firm. **axes:** - the x-axis lists attributes of a brand or company, presumably such as \"reliability,\" \"innovativeness,\" \"affordability,\" and so forth. the chart appears to include at least 20 to 30 attributes. - the y-axis is numerical, with percentage values ranging from -25% to 25% but focused more on the middle range of -1% to 5%. **bars:** - individual attributes are represented by two-colored bars (likely green and red) that indicate whether the brands surveyed were perceived positively or negatively in comparison to the average. - the chart visually measures these perceptions against multiple brands: 3shape, zirkon zahn, exocad, dentsply sirona, and ivoclar vivadent. - each bar displays a percentage that suggests the deviation from the general mean (indicated with a red or green color). - some of the major attributes highlighted include: - **reliability:** generally close to 0%, with some brands showing higher positive deviations. - **innovation:** mentioned alongside reliability, but with varying degrees of positivity or negativity across brands. - **affordability:** presented in a similar way, indicating consumer perception of pricing. - the bars for affordability and innovation are noticeable with specific brands like exocad showing remarkable negatives. ### specific observations for key attributes: **leading brands:** - exocad and dentsply sirona are prominent, with exocad showing particularly stark contrasts in certain attributes, notably innovation and reliability leading to significantly lower percentages. - dentsply sirona, despite having a high positive deviation in innovation being +21%, also shows a significant negative percentage in another area, perhaps highlighting internal inconsistencies. **average performing brands:** - zirkon zahn and 3shape demonstrate mixed performance, with a few notable positive and negative deviations relative to their peers. **comparisons:** - the chart's structure facilitates easy comparison between brands and attributes, suggesting a detailed analysis of consumer perceptions. particularly, the stark -15% and -25% for exocad and ivoclar vivadent respectively indicate strong areas for concern needing

standing. it provides a concentrated insight, highlighting specific strengths and weaknesses relative to the mean across distinct attributes, presenting a comprehensive yet precise visualization for brands. the image contains a detailed bar chart breaking down the results of surveys conducted. the chart analyzes the respondents' perceptions of various aspects related to brand positioning. each bar is labeled with specific feedback percentages of different aspects. the bars are color-coded, with green indicating positive feedback and red indicating negative feedback. there are eight categories listed on the left side of the chart, with corresponding green or red bars indicating the respondents' feelings about each aspect. these categories include \"worldwide reknown,\" \"reliable,\" \"highly reputable,\" \"innovative and at the forefront,\" \"makes daily practice easier,\" \"affordable,\" \"leading company,\" \"customer service oriented,\" \"too expensive,\" and \"good price quality ratio.\" additionally, the overall brand perception is indicated, with a bar for \"overall\" that serves as a benchmark for comparisons among different brands. for every category, the chart shows the average score and the standard deviation, allowing for a visual comparison of strengths and weaknesses across different brands. for example, \"innovative and at the forefront\" displays a strong green bar indicating a high positive percentage, suggesting that respondents believe the brand is forward-thinking. on the contrary, \"too expensive\" has a significantly high negative percentage (red bar), indicating a major concern or perceived issue with the brand's pricing. the second image is a zoom-in on part of this bar chart, focusing on a specific aspect related to the aforementioned categories. this zoomed-in section likely highlights the response distribution of a specific brand or category to draw more in-depth conclusions. the specific aspect covered in this section (the second image) appears to be \"innovative and at the forefront.\" the bar graph in the second image shows that the brand receives a significantly positive (green) 12% feedback on this particular aspect, with some variability as evidenced by the standard deviation indicated. it also highlights a negative (red) percentage at a significant value of -21%, implying concerns about the brand's innovation leading to less impact in other areas. overall, the image provides a concise yet thorough overview of respondents' perceptions of brand innovation and reliability, showing both positive and negative feedback clearly organized for easy comparison and analysis. the image contains a single vertical bar chart displaying data comparison across six different entities. the chart represents data pertaining to \"brand positioning: focus on totally relevant - difference from mean.\" each bar is color-coded with green above the horizontal zero line and red below it, indicating positive and negative differences from the mean, respectively. these positive and negative differences are quantitatively expressed in percentage. the chart appears to be comparing scores or feedback points associated with different aspects or attributes of brands. starting from the top: the topmost bar reaches 24% with a green bar, indicating that it is 24% points above the mean. below that is a -2% red bar, showing a 2% point difference below the mean. the next green bar is at 14%. following that, two identical red bars indicate -7% with two separate bars. the next bars are colored in green at 8%, with two separate bars each. moving down, two red bars indicate -13% and -29%, followed by one positive green bar at 14%. the final bar is notably the largest red bar at -23%. the chart is presented in a simplistic format with no additional text or details beyond the bars and their percentages, making the data visualization focused and straightforward. this design allows for quick and comparative analysis of the brands' performance relative to the overall average in the specific context. the image contains a comparison of brand positioning statements among eight companies, focusing on their relevance to customers' perceptions. the comparison is visually represented in two ways: a horizontal cluster map (left column) and a vertical bar graph (right column). each row in the horizontal map represents a different brand and the various green and red bars represent positive and negative perceptions of attributes respectively. in this context, the second segment, labeled as \"3shape,\" is represented both through the horizontal cluster map and vertical bar graph. in the horizontal cluster map for 3shape, several attributes are listed on the left side under the \"overall\" column, with corresponding horizontal bars showing the difference from the mean. notably visible are the green bar (8%) and red bar (-2%) for two attributes, with the majority of horizontal bars being very low, indicating minimal perceived differences. moving to the right side of the map, the attributes for 3shape are again listed under \"overall,\" \"zirkonzahn,\" \"exocad,\" etc. the red bar for \"too expensive\" stands out prominently at -25%, indicating a significantly higher negative perception compared to other attributes. it is also one of the few bars that extends below the 0% line, showcasing a notably negative perception for this particular attribute. the vertical bar graph provides a condensed comparison, where each brand is represented by a column of alternating green and red bars, marking positive and negative perceptions respectively. the green bar for 3shape is quite slender at 2%, while the red bars are more substantial, totaling approximately 15%. the largest and most visually striking feature is the red bar at -27%, which stands out as a significant negative perception area among the brands being compared. the graph visually segments the attributes and highlights the extreme -27% red bar in comparison to those brands' average standings. these analyses from both perspectives indicate that 3shape predominantly faces negative perceptions, particularly around the high cost factor, which is starkly represented in both the horizontal cluster map and vertical bar graph. the image contains a bar graph titled 'brand positioning: focus on \"totally relevant\"', which represents the difference in brand positioning in relation to specific attributes. this is done across different brands, with each brand's attributes rated on a
