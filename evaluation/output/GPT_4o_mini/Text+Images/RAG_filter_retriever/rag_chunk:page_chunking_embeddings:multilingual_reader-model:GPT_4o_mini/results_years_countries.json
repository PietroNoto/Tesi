            "21 how useful do you consider the use of an intraoral scanner in the following situations? base: 371 (total sample) france (%) italy (%) spain (%) mean vote (1-5) usefulness of the ios in different situations total (%) there is not a significant difference in the perceived usefulness of the scanner across the different situations listed as all of them receive a high level of consideration. however, time optimization, improving clinical effectiveness, and internal planning activities are the three situations where the scanner is considered most useful. spain considers the scanner less useful as a tool for optimizing times compared to the other two countries. italian dentists, on the other hand, find the scanner quite useful in all the listed situations, with slightly less emphasis on improving effectiveness. in france, respondents show less importance toward the usefulness of the scanner for improving internal planning activities, as a communication tools, and as a marketing tool, showing a strong orientation towards optimization and clinical effectiveness. in fact, only french dentists place less value on communication and marketing topics, while in other countries, all topics are rated very positively. the image shows a detailed line graph depicting the \"mean vote\" for the usefulness of the intraoral scanner across different countries. the graph is split into three lines, colored in purple, blue, and pink, each corresponding to france, italy, and spain, respectively. the x-axis of the graph indicates various factors that the intraoral scanner is considered valuable for: 1. \"improving clinical effectiveness, accuracy, and predictability of treatments\". 2. \"improving internal planning activities, orthodontic, surgical, and\/or implant prosthesis\". 3. \"communication tool with the patient for improving compliance and relationship even after treatment\". 4. \"marketing tool that improves the practice\". the y-axis, on the right side, plots the mean score on a scale from 1 to 5, representing the level of perceived usefulness for each country, with higher numbers correlating to higher perceived usefulness. ### line graph details: 1. **improving clinical effectiveness, accuracy, and predictability of treatments:** - both france (purple) and spain (pink) show consistent high usage over the points marked, with scores hovering close to 4. - italy (blue) starts with a lower score but increases incrementally but without as significant a peak. 2. **improving internal planning activities, orthodontic, surgical, and\/or implant prosthesis:** - france and spain continue to rate the scanner favorably, with scores staying around 4. - italys score is slightly lower than the previous category but shows improvement with a peak closer to the earlier range but still not fully as high. 3. **communication tool with the patient:** - france maintains high scores, close to 4. - spain sees a significant rise after the initial point from around 3 to nearing 4. - italy initially has a score around 3, gradually increasing but stays below the other countries in this category. 4. **marketing tool that improves the practice:** - france continues high usage, similar to the previous categories. - spain starts lower but then reaches the highest scores, showing the scanner's notable utility here. - italy mirrors its performance from prior categories, staying around mid-range. ### analysis: france maintains a consistent, high level of perceived usefulness across all categories, showing it as a favored tool for multiple aspects of dental practice. spain shows a significant increase in usefulness over time for certain categories, indicating it may have greater adoption or increased awareness of the scanners applications. italy, while improving, remains relatively lower across all categories, suggesting either slower adoption or the scanners utility being felt more in specific areas as opposed to across-the-board effectiveness. overall, the graph visualizes the comparison between these three european countries, highlighting the versatility and perceived benefits of the intraoral scanner in different areas of dental and orthodontic practices. the image contains a chart illustrating the perceived usefulness of an intraoral scanner across various dental practice scenarios based on the feedback of dentists in four different countries: france, italy, spain, and an aggregate of the surveyed dentists' responses. the survey sample size is 371 respondents in total. the chart is partitioned into five rows, corresponding to different applications and purposes of the scanner: 1. **tool for optimizing times (from chairside operations to laboratory work):** -
