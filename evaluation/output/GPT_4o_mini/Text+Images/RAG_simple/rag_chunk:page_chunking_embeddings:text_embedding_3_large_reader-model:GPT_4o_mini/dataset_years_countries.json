both france (purple) and spain (pink) show consistent high usage over the points marked, with scores hovering close to 4. - italy (blue) starts with a lower score but increases incrementally but without as significant a peak. 2. **improving internal planning activities, orthodontic, surgical, and/or implant prosthesis:** - france and spain continue to rate the scanner favorably, with scores staying around 4. - italys score is slightly lower than the previous category but shows improvement with a peak closer to the earlier range but still not fully as high. 3. **communication tool with the patient:** - france maintains high scores, close to 4. - spain sees a significant rise after the initial point from around 3 to nearing 4. - italy initially has a score around 3, gradually increasing but stays below the other countries in this category. 4. **marketing tool that improves the practice:** - france continues high usage, similar to the previous categories. - spain starts lower but then reaches the highest scores, showing the scanner's notable utility here. - italy mirrors its performance from prior categories, staying around mid-range. ### analysis: france maintains a consistent, high level of perceived usefulness across all categories, showing it as a favored tool for multiple aspects of dental practice. spain shows a significant increase in usefulness over time for certain categories, indicating it may have greater adoption or increased awareness of the scanners applications. italy, while improving, remains relatively lower across all categories, suggesting either slower adoption or the scanners utility being felt more in specific areas as opposed to across-the-board effectiveness. overall, the graph visualizes the comparison between these three european countries, highlighting the versatility and perceived benefits of the intraoral scanner in different areas of dental and orthodontic practices. the image contains a chart illustrating the perceived usefulness of an intraoral scanner across various dental practice scenarios based on the feedback of dentists in four different countries: france, italy, spain, and an aggregate of the surveyed dentists' responses. the survey sample size is 371 respondents in total. the chart is partitioned into five rows, corresponding to different applications and purposes of the scanner: 1. **tool for optimizing times (from chairside operations to laboratory work):** - encompassing france (24%), italy (50%), spain (18%), andmean votefrom3.6to4.0. 2. **tool for improving clinical effectiveness, accuracy, and predictability of treatments:** - including france (18%), italy (24%), spain (50%),mean votefrom3.3to4.0. 3. **tool for improving internal planning activities, orthodontic, surgical, and/or implant prosthetics:** - with responses from france (15%), italy (24%), spain (51%),mean votefrom2.9to4.0. 4. **communication tool with the patient for improving compliance and relationship even after treatment:** - including france (14%), italy (46%), spain (30%),mean votefrom3.3to4.0. 5. **marketing tool that improves the practice:** - encompassing france (13%), italy (45%), spain (31%),mean votefrom3.3to3. each application category is further broken down into five response tiers, each represented by a bar that corresponds to each country's feedback, with the following color codes indicating each tier: indispensable (green) very useful (light green) quite useful (yellow) not very useful (red) useless (dark pink) additionally, the image utilizes a secondary bar graph that visually depicts the mean voting score (from 1 to 5) for each application across the four countries. this graph aids in quickly grasping the aggregated perception levels. a key observation is the general high level of perceived usefulness for the scanner, with nearly all applications garnering substantial percentages of \"indispensable\" and \"very useful\" feedback. the chart effectively communicates the utility of the scanner across different professional and practice-oriented perspectives.",

influenced by the size of the dental practice and the age of their initial scanners. those who already own ios represent a highly relevant and strategic segment 61% of respondents own an ios scanner owner prospects 39% of respondents are prospects non-owner prospects the image contains a pie chart titled \"io s ownership,\" which visually represents the categories of respondents under that heading. there are three primary sections within the pie chart, each representing a different aspect or group of respondents. the chart is segmented into shades of green and pink, clearly breaking down the data as follows: 1. **primary sector (50% of respondents)**: this is the largest section in the chart, shaded in pink. it signifies that 50% of the respondents fall under the category labeled 'io s ownership'. 2. **secondary sector (39% of respondents)**: this green segment represents the second-largest section. it indicates that 39% of the respondents are categorized here. 3. **tertiary sector (11% of respondents)**: the smallest green segment, representing 11% of the respondents. the chart also includes text labels at the bottom, clarifying that 16% of respondents are scanners, while 45% are owners of io scanners. overall, this pie chart succinctly quantifies the distribution of respondents' ownership and roles regarding scanners. the colors used enhance differentiation between the categories, making it easy to visually distinguish the proportions of each subset. the clear labeling at the bottom ensures that any viewer can quickly grasp the breakdown and context. the image contains three bar graphs side by side, arranged vertically, each representing data on \"prospective buyers from future and current owners\" as pertains to introral scanners and their demographics. from left to right, these graphs are labeled as \"country,\" \"age,\" and \"dental practice size.\" *country graph:** this bar graph displays country-wise data on ownership and intentions to purchase introral scanners. it includes four countries: **france**, **italy**, **spain**, and data combined for groups under the headings \"up to 44,\" \"from 45 to 54,\" \"over 54,\" \"up to 2 chairs,\" \"3 chairs,\" and \"more than 3 chairs.\" for 'france', the breakdown starts with \"no, but we plan to purchase one in the future\" at 48%, followed by 32% with \"yes, more than one and we have plans to purchase another,\" 16% with \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one,\" and 20% with \"no but have not indicated any future interest.\" 'italy' shows \"yes, more than one and we have plans to purchase another one\" at 52%, \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 36%, and \"no but have not indicated any future interest\" at 12%. spain reflects \"no but have not indicated any future interest\" at 49%, \"yes, more than one and we have plans to purchase another one\" at 36%, and \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 15%. for \"up to 44,\" \"from 45 to 54,\" \"over 54,\" \"up to 2 chairs,\" \"3 chairs,\" and \"more than 3 chairs,\" the percentages show varying degrees of interest and ownership. *age graph:** this bar graph depicts data across six age groups categorized as \"under 45\" and \"45 and above.\" for 'under 45,' it's split into \"no, but we have not indicated any future interest\" at 32%, \"yes, more than one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 50%, and \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 36%. for the age group \"from 45 to 54,\" the breakdown is similar with \"no but have not indicated any future interest\" at 46%, \"yes, more than one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 18%, and \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 18%. for 'over 54,' the percentages are \"no but have not indicated any future interest\" at 41%, \"yes, more than one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 12%, and \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 5%. *dental practice size graph:** this graph is segmented into three groups: \"up to 2 chairs,\" \"3 chairs,\" and \"over 3 chairs.\" for \"up to 2 chairs,\" the percentages reflect \"no but have not indicated any future interest\" at 52%, \"yes, more than one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 43%, and \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 27%. for the \"3 chairs\" category, the breakdown is \"no but have not indicated any future interest\" at 55%, \"yes, more than one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 18%, and \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 40%. in the \"over 3 chairs\" category, the percentages similarly show \"no but have not indicated any future interest\" at 40%, \"yes, more than one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 43%, and \"yes, one and we plan to purchase another one\" at 17%. the second image effectively shows varying patterns and trends in the willingness of different demographics to purchase introral scanners with distinct preferences based on countries, age, and dental practice size.",

both france (purple) and spain (pink) show consistent high usage over the points marked, with scores hovering close to 4. - italy (blue) starts with a lower score but increases incrementally but without as significant a peak. 2. **improving internal planning activities, orthodontic, surgical, and/or implant prosthesis:** - france and spain continue to rate the scanner favorably, with scores staying around 4. - italys score is slightly lower than the previous category but shows improvement with a peak closer to the earlier range but still not fully as high. 3. **communication tool with the patient:** - france maintains high scores, close to 4. - spain sees a significant rise after the initial point from around 3 to nearing 4. - italy initially has a score around 3, gradually increasing but stays below the other countries in this category. 4. **marketing tool that improves the practice:** - france continues high usage, similar to the previous categories. - spain starts lower but then reaches the highest scores, showing the scanner's notable utility here. - italy mirrors its performance from prior categories, staying around mid-range. ### analysis: france maintains a consistent, high level of perceived usefulness across all categories, showing it as a favored tool for multiple aspects of dental practice. spain shows a significant increase in usefulness over time for certain categories, indicating it may have greater adoption or increased awareness of the scanners applications. italy, while improving, remains relatively lower across all categories, suggesting either slower adoption or the scanners utility being felt more in specific areas as opposed to across-the-board effectiveness. overall, the graph visualizes the comparison between these three european countries, highlighting the versatility and perceived benefits of the intraoral scanner in different areas of dental and orthodontic practices. the image contains a chart illustrating the perceived usefulness of an intraoral scanner across various dental practice scenarios based on the feedback of dentists in four different countries: france, italy, spain, and an aggregate of the surveyed dentists' responses. the survey sample size is 371 respondents in total. the chart is partitioned into five rows, corresponding to different applications and purposes of the scanner: 1. **tool for optimizing times (from chairside operations to laboratory work):** - encompassing france (24%), italy (50%), spain (18%), andmean votefrom3.6to4.0. 2. **tool for improving clinical effectiveness, accuracy, and predictability of treatments:** - including france (18%), italy (24%), spain (50%),mean votefrom3.3to4.0. 3. **tool for improving internal planning activities, orthodontic, surgical, and/or implant prosthetics:** - with responses from france (15%), italy (24%), spain (51%),mean votefrom2.9to4.0. 4. **communication tool with the patient for improving compliance and relationship even after treatment:** - including france (14%), italy (46%), spain (30%),mean votefrom3.3to4.0. 5. **marketing tool that improves the practice:** - encompassing france (13%), italy (45%), spain (31%),mean votefrom3.3to3. each application category is further broken down into five response tiers, each represented by a bar that corresponds to each country's feedback, with the following color codes indicating each tier: indispensable (green) very useful (light green) quite useful (yellow) not very useful (red) useless (dark pink) additionally, the image utilizes a secondary bar graph that visually depicts the mean voting score (from 1 to 5) for each application across the four countries. this graph aids in quickly grasping the aggregated perception levels. a key observation is the general high level of perceived usefulness for the scanner, with nearly all applications garnering substantial percentages of \"indispensable\" and \"very useful\" feedback. the chart effectively communicates the utility of the scanner across different professional and practice-oriented perspectives.",

4% increased slightly - 37% stable - 38% decreased slightly - 17% decreased a lot - 3% the chart is a horizontal bar graph with each bar representing the percentage of different perceptions of the current business situation. the bars and their corresponding labels are color-coded, with darker colors representing a higher percentage of respondents. #### observations: the largest segment appears to be \"stable\" at 38%, indicating that almost 40% of respondents believe the current business situation has remained unchanged over the past 12 months. the next two major perceptions are \"increased slightly\" with 37% and \"increased a lot\" with 4%. \"decreased slightly\" and \"decreased a lot\" are significantly lower at 17% and 3% respectively. ### perception about the future *categories**: it will increase a lot - 6% it will increase slightly - 32% it will remain stable - 54% it will decrease slightly - 6% it will decrease a lot - 1% this analysis also uses a horizontal bar chart to show perceptions of the future of business over the same period. similar to the first chart, bars and colors are used to visualize this data. #### observations: the most common response is that the business situation will \"remain stable\" with 54%, showcasing high confidence levels in maintaining current conditions into the future. \"increase slightly\" and \"increase a lot\" received moderate responses at 32% and 6%, respectively. \"decrease slightly\" and \"decrease a lot\" are the least selected options, garnering 6% and 1% of the responses. ### coherent analysis comparing the two sets of data, there are notable differences and trends: 1. **current condition vs. future trend**: - a large number of respondents (36%) view their current situation as either improving slightly or improving a lot. this suggests optimism about recent changes or improvements. - conversely, the majority (54%) do not anticipate a substantial change (either increase/decrease a lot or decrease slightly) in the future, underscoring a belief in stability or a mild increase. 2. **stability in perception**: - there is a notable stability factor in both categories, with 38% of responses for current situation perception and 54% for future situation perception. 3. **moderate change expectations**: - a moderate but significant portion (37%) expect at least a slightly positive change going forward, which is echoed by their perception of the present business conditions. 4. **underconfidence in decreases**: - less than 10% of respondents anticipate larger negative changes in either their current or future business situation, indicating a general confidence in avoiding significant declines. this detailed analysis of both charts indicates a pattern of cautious optimism with a preference for stability, where current improvements are believed to continue, albeit not in large measures. the image contains a bar chart titled \"analysis of confidence: perception of current situation vs. perception of the future.\" it provides a comparison between how respondents perceive the current situation versus their forecast for the future. the sample for the data is noted as 588 cases (whole sample). the chart also gives a brief overview of the data evaluation method stating that it involves a comparison between the perception of the situation over the last 12 months and the forecast. specifically, the chart details respondents' beliefs about the future situation as follows: the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"increase a lot\" is 6%. this is visually represented by a green bar. the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"increase slightly\" is 32%. it is depicted with a light green bar. the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"remain stable\" is 54%. this is clearly highlighted by the yellow bar occupying the most space in the chart. the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"decrease slightly\" is 6%. this is depicted by an orange bar. the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"decrease a lot\" is 1%. this is visualized by the shortest red bar at the bottom of the chart. this comparison illustrates that a significantly higher proportion of respondents (54%) expects the future situation to remain stable, followed by those who think there will be an increase either a lot or slightly. conversely, the percentages indicating a decrease, whether slight or significant, are notably lower.",
