\"plaster models sent to manufacturers\/milling centers.\" this section highlights the importance of digital restoration and the impact of outsourcing on these percentages. overall, the image offers a visual representation of the tech usage trends in digital restoration across different lab practices. the image contains a bar chart that breaks down the percentage of laboratories using different technology for digital restoration. the chart is divided into three main categories: in-house milling, scanner, and full outsourcing. under the first category, in-house milling, 19% of the laboratories utilize this method. in the second category, scanner, 33% of laboratories employ a scanner for digital restoration, out of which 63% of these users are scanners owned by fulloutside milling center. the third category, full outsourcing, represents the largest portion with 61% of laboratories. additionally, there is a breakdown of 38% of the total digital restoration providers who use the scanner to send the files outside for milling. these percentages illustrate that the methods for digital restoration significantly vary among laboratories. however, the chart explicitly shows an increase in scanner ownership among milling center owners in comparison to full outsourcing. the chart also provides a comparison for each technology used in 2015 and 2018, which can provide insights into trends over time in the usage of these technologies. the overall layout and information distribution aim to give a comprehensive overview of where different laboratories stand regarding the use of digital restoration technologies.","key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 29 equipment use and intention to buy the analysis on digital technologies went deeper with the investigation of the main used brands of this segment. in specific, the investigation took into consideration the brands used for scanning and for milling. chart equipment use: scanners - europe the analysis proved that the penetration of this kind equipment varies widely, according to the sample taken into consideration. the sample of dental practices made up of digital technologies users stated to use an intraoral scanner in 20% of the cases, while the corresponding sample of laboratories stated to use a scanner in 84% of the cases. for the former sample, the penetration of dental scanners related to those laboratories having a scanner for either sending outside scan files (in this case, the percentage is 55%) or to be used with an in-lab milling center. chart equipment use: brand numeric distribution, scanners - europe the image shows two pie charts, each representing a different group within the context of dental practices and laboratories. these charts provide insights into the frequency of the use of specific equipment. on the left, the pie chart is labeled \"dental practices.\" this chart indicates a significant majority (80%) of dental practices do not use a certain piece of equipment, while a small minority (20%) do. this suggests that this particular piece of equipment is not widely adopted by dental practitioners in this sample group. on the right, the pie chart is labeled \"laboratories.\" here, a much smaller percentage (16%) do not use this equipment, while a vast majority (84%) do. this stark contrast highlights a high adoption rate of the equipment among laboratories compared to dental practices. overall, both pie charts illustrate the differing levels of adoption and usage of the specific equipment in question across dental practices and laboratories, with a clear trend of higher usage by laboratories and lower usage by dental practices. the image contains a bar plot titled \"equipment use: brand numeric distribution, scanners -

\"basis: whole sample,\" which represents the entire combined dataset or the whole sample base used for this particular analysis of technique penetration. next to the chart, on the right side, theres a boxed section providing some contextual information and explanations regarding the data presented. specifically, it highlights aspects of digitalization within laboratories and differences in digital workflow penetration across various regions: **prolonged digitalization:** 88% of labs receive scan files. **traditional dominance:** its especially high in spain and lower in the uk. smaller labs (16.9% of full digital workflow) tend to have lower interest in increasing digitized work share through scan files. full digital workflow penetration varies but is generally high, particularly in spain and italy, but often remains fragmented. different techniques are noted for traditional, partial, and full digital workflow, each with its own percentage. it provides a table that aligns these percentages per country, with the top countries significantly higher compared to others. this detailed context and breakdown offer insight into how different european regions approach various techniques within their laboratory practices. the image contains a pie chart that reflects the breakdown of laboratory practices by level of digital workflow penetration in various countries. the pie chart is divided into three sections, each representing a different category: traditional techniques (42.2%): this section is the largest portion of the pie chart, indicating that traditional techniques have the highest usage percentage among the three categories. partial digital workflow (35.3%): this section is slightly smaller than the section for traditional techniques, showing that partial digital workflow is moderately used compared to both traditional techniques and full digital workflow. full digital workflow (22.5%): this section is the smallest part of the pie chart, reflecting that full digital workflow is less penetrated when compared to traditional techniques and partial digital workflow. the legend at the bottom of the pie chart provides colors to match each category: traditional techniques are depicted in a darker shade. partial digital workflow is shown in a lighter shade. full digital workflow is colored in the same lightest shade as the second sector. there are a few other annotations in the image: a text box with bullet points detailing the analysis and context, mentioning that digitalization is very high with 88% of labs receiving scan files. a statement indicating that full digital workflow penetration varies significantly in different countries, with some countries fragmented, while some show a sparser adoption of digital working processes. additional notes on lab penetration, digital workflow declaration, and different penetration rates for varying techniques. based on this, it can be inferred that the pie chart is illustrating the usage patterns of different techniques in laboratories, primarily distinguished by levels of digital workflow, indicating a nuanced adoption rate across various countries and

interest or no demand, highlighting a persistent lack of engagement even in the red and diagonal arrows represent a category that the respondents did not choose, suggesting an area not significant in the survey but perhaps indicating low preference. the gray bars show preferences for conventional methods, which have slightly dropped from 21% in 2015 to 10% in 2018, demonstrating a shift in preference. the colored bars also indicate an increase in the 'familiarity with technology' category from 1% to 3%, suggesting a growing acceptance but not widespread demand. the image contains a pie
