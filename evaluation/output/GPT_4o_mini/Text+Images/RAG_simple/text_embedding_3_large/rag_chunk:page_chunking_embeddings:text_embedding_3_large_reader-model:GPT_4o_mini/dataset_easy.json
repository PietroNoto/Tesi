57% feel uncomfortable. - 23% are closer to using them because they are the future of prostheses. - 4% feel comfortable. - 13% reported using them but feeling uncomfortable. 2. **france (fr)**: - 47% feel uncomfortable. - 9% are getting closer because they see them as the future. - 4% feel comfortable. - 6% are using them but uncomfortable. - 6% feel completely comfortable but are using them. 3. **italy (it)**: - 55% feel uncomfortable. - 13% feel comfortable. - 4% are getting closer due to the future of prosthetics. - 28% reported using them but feeling uncomfortable. 4. **spain (sp)**: - 54% feel uncomfortable. - 17% are getting closer due to the future value in prostheses. - 3% feel comfortable. - 0% reported getting closer for use but feeling uncomfortable. 5. **united kingdom (uk)**: - 44% feel uncomfortable. - 4% are getting closer because they think they are future tools. - 5% feel comfortable. - 17% said they were using them but feeling uncomfortable. - 41% reported feeling uncomfortable overall, but there is no segment showing the percentage of those more comfortable. the bar graphs align and extend the information from the pie chart to provide insights into the acceptance levels in specific countries. overall, there is a prominent trend among dental practices, with a majority of respondents in all countries expressing discomfort with digital technologies, although some are either getting familiar with them or using them as perceived as a future necessity in dental practices. the image shows a pie chart and bar graph depicting dentists' acceptance and familiarity with digital technology in dental offices. the text explains various respondent sentiments towards the increasing use of digital technology, primarily in the context of dental practices in europe. the pie chart indicates the proportion of dentists' feelings on digital technology across europe and breaks down countries like denmark, italy, and the uk. the categories presented include: **i feel uncomfortable and rather far from them (12%)** this section illustrates dentists who feel uneasy and distant from digital technologies, with a notable percentage at 12%. **i am getting closer to them because i think they are the future of prosthetics (44%)** here, 44% of the dentists express that they are increasingly embracing these technologies as they believe they are the future of prosthetics. **i am using digital technologies because i need, but i am not comfortable with it (13%)** 13% of the dentists use these technologies out of necessity but report feeling uncomfortable with them. **i am using digital technologies and i am comfortable with it (17%)** 17% of dentists are comfortable using digital technologies for both their practices and procedures. **dont know (15%)** on the question of discomfort with digital technologies, 15% of the dentists are uncertain. additional observations from the accompanying bar graphs for individual countries (denmark, italy, the uk, and germany) reiterate the trends but highlight variability across these countries. for instance, denmark shows a higher percentage for those who are comfortable with digital technology compared to others, while the uk shows a marked percentage of dentists are getting closer to these technologies because they think they are the future of prosthetics. moreover, the text notes that the majority of respondents believe digital technologies will not replace traditional restorations but will play an increasingly important role, as evidenced by the higher percentages in italy and spain in using digital technologies in their practices. lastly, the context suggests a cautious yet evolving acceptance of digital technologies among dental professionals, primarily driven by the future trends in prosthetics and the need to modernize practice methods despite some initial discomfort.",

using a dotted vertical line to indicate a median satisfaction value for the overall assessment of open technologies. the image contains a graph depicting molecular structures and associated numerical values. the molecular structure consists of carbon and hydrogen atoms forming a chain with double bonds indicating the presence of alkene. each molecule is represented by a unique set of numbers and symbols: the first molecular structure starts at the left and has the number values 6,8,9,7,7,8,6,78, which correspond to the atomic or molecular weights. the numbered connections represent chemical bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms, indicating their relative positions in the chain. the sequence of numbers (6, 8, 9, 7, 7, etc.) might signify weight assignments or functional group identifiers in the compound. each molecule terminates towards the right and is arranged in a continuous series, showing a systematic increase and decrease in numerical sequence, implying variations in structural isomers or functional group substitutions. the graph uses a color gradient from cyan to purple to distinguish between different values, highlighting differentiation in molecular compositions and possibly their characteristics or activities. this type of visualization could be used in scientific research for comparative analysis of molecular structures in a biological, chemical, or pharmaceutical context. the image contains a detailed graphical representation of the satisfaction levels of survey respondents concerning the features of open technologies and their overall performance. it appears to be extracted directly from the first image. the second image specifically highlights the frequency of software updates and the costs associated with these updates. it shows two sets of bar graphs positioned next to each other, each corresponding to the satisfaction levels of users on these two aspects: the left side shows the percentage of respondents who indicated various satisfaction levels for the frequency of software updates (presumably ranging from 'basically satisfied' to 'not at all satisfied' and 'no clue'). there is a noticeable distinction in satisfaction levels, with a significant number of users rating the updates as 'basically satisfied.' the percentage is divided into different sections, represented by colors ranging from yellow at least partially to green for those who are'very satisfied.' the right side shows the percentage of respondents with varying satisfaction levels concerning the costs of software updates. similar to the left side, this graph also shows different levels of satisfaction with green indicating the highest level of satisfaction. the cost aspect indicates that for a large percentage, the updates are seen as very costly, while others are quite satisfied, likely due to the perceived value and effectiveness of the updates. the data is visually laid out in a comparative format within a single panel for easy comparison. each section is neatly segmented, and the colors differentiate between levels of satisfaction, creating a clear visual hierarchy of responses.",

4% increased slightly - 37% stable - 38% decreased slightly - 17% decreased a lot - 3% the chart is a horizontal bar graph with each bar representing the percentage of different perceptions of the current business situation. the bars and their corresponding labels are color-coded, with darker colors representing a higher percentage of respondents. #### observations: the largest segment appears to be \"stable\" at 38%, indicating that almost 40% of respondents believe the current business situation has remained unchanged over the past 12 months. the next two major perceptions are \"increased slightly\" with 37% and \"increased a lot\" with 4%. \"decreased slightly\" and \"decreased a lot\" are significantly lower at 17% and 3% respectively. ### perception about the future *categories**: it will increase a lot - 6% it will increase slightly - 32% it will remain stable - 54% it will decrease slightly - 6% it will decrease a lot - 1% this analysis also uses a horizontal bar chart to show perceptions of the future of business over the same period. similar to the first chart, bars and colors are used to visualize this data. #### observations: the most common response is that the business situation will \"remain stable\" with 54%, showcasing high confidence levels in maintaining current conditions into the future. \"increase slightly\" and \"increase a lot\" received moderate responses at 32% and 6%, respectively. \"decrease slightly\" and \"decrease a lot\" are the least selected options, garnering 6% and 1% of the responses. ### coherent analysis comparing the two sets of data, there are notable differences and trends: 1. **current condition vs. future trend**: - a large number of respondents (36%) view their current situation as either improving slightly or improving a lot. this suggests optimism about recent changes or improvements. - conversely, the majority (54%) do not anticipate a substantial change (either increase/decrease a lot or decrease slightly) in the future, underscoring a belief in stability or a mild increase. 2. **stability in perception**: - there is a notable stability factor in both categories, with 38% of responses for current situation perception and 54% for future situation perception. 3. **moderate change expectations**: - a moderate but significant portion (37%) expect at least a slightly positive change going forward, which is echoed by their perception of the present business conditions. 4. **underconfidence in decreases**: - less than 10% of respondents anticipate larger negative changes in either their current or future business situation, indicating a general confidence in avoiding significant declines. this detailed analysis of both charts indicates a pattern of cautious optimism with a preference for stability, where current improvements are believed to continue, albeit not in large measures. the image contains a bar chart titled \"analysis of confidence: perception of current situation vs. perception of the future.\" it provides a comparison between how respondents perceive the current situation versus their forecast for the future. the sample for the data is noted as 588 cases (whole sample). the chart also gives a brief overview of the data evaluation method stating that it involves a comparison between the perception of the situation over the last 12 months and the forecast. specifically, the chart details respondents' beliefs about the future situation as follows: the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"increase a lot\" is 6%. this is visually represented by a green bar. the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"increase slightly\" is 32%. it is depicted with a light green bar. the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"remain stable\" is 54%. this is clearly highlighted by the yellow bar occupying the most space in the chart. the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"decrease slightly\" is 6%. this is depicted by an orange bar. the percentage of respondents who believe the future situation will \"decrease a lot\" is 1%. this is visualized by the shortest red bar at the bottom of the chart. this comparison illustrates that a significantly higher proportion of respondents (54%) expects the future situation to remain stable, followed by those who think there will be an increase either a lot or slightly. conversely, the percentages indicating a decrease, whether slight or significant, are notably lower.",

**product and service quality - 43% (depicted in blue)** - **easy practice - 21% (depicted in green)** - **management costs - 26% (depicted in red)** - **compatibility - 9% (depicted in yellow)** each factor is represented with a corresponding color indicating its respective weight in customer satisfaction analysis for \"dental practices.\" ### for laboratories: the bar graph for \"laboratories\" mirrors the same horizontal bar format, showing a different set of data. the percentage weighting is distributed as follows: - **product quality - 32% (depicted in blue)** - **support and assistance - 33% (depicted in green)** - **management costs - 18% (depicted in red)** - **compatibility - 17% (depicted in yellow)** like the \"dental practices\" graph, each factor is connected to a color signifying its impact on customer satisfaction for \"laboratories.\" *explanation and analysis**: the first bar graph indicates that for \"dental practices,\" \"product and service quality\" holds the largest weight at 43%, significantly influencing customer satisfaction. this implies that the quality and service provided by dental practices are of paramount importance to their customers. the \"easy practice\" factor comes next at 21%, showing its substantial but secondary role in overall satisfaction. this points out the importance of user-friendly processes and practices within dental practices. both \"management costs\" and \"compatibility\" make up smaller portions of satisfaction assessment, with \"management costs\" influencing slightly more than \"compatibility,\" emphasizing the significance of financial aspects in client perception. for \"laboratories,\" the \"support and assistance\" factor holds the highest weight at 33%, followed closely by \"product quality.\" this reveals that both the assistance provided and the quality of the products or services are key drivers of laboratory satisfaction among customers. \"management costs\" and \"compatibility\" play more substantial but slightly less crucial roles compared to \"dental practices\". these graphs represent a comparative analysis to identify the primary determinants of customer satisfaction for each entity type, offering significant insights into what customers value most and how their satisfaction is influenced by these various aspects.",
