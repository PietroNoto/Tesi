a scanner or in-lab milling unit based on two different categories of users: digital equipment users and in-lab milling users. *scanners:** the chart for scanners shows a breakdown with five primary categories and one miscellaneous category: 1. **quality of the restorations:** represented by the largest blue segment, this dominates with 28%, indicating that many users value the quality of restorations significantly. 2. **makes the daily practice easier:** follows as the second most important reason at 19%. 3. **broad range of procedures:** coming third with 16% of the votes. 4. **innovation:** slightly less important than the broad range of procedures, it accounts for 15%. 5. **production increase:** with a 12% share, pointing to efficiency improvements. 6. **reputation of the brand:** important to some, with 5% of the responses. 7. **convenience:** also rated as important but not as prevalent, at 5%. 8. **flexibility:** rated a bit lower, at 4%. 9. **quality of the

5%. 12. **don't know:** a minimal 3% of users remain undecisive. additionally, a descriptive note at the end explains that ease of daily practice and the quality of restorations are primary reasons for using digital equipment. it also notes flexibility and convenience as less prominent factors but emphasized by the survey respondents. *in-lab milling:** for in-lab milling, the categories show a similar breakdown,"],"10":["clinica + labo\" and \"laboratorio\" respectively. this demonstrates that the demand for information and product integration remains high. by 2015, this factor retained significant importance with 38% and 39% respectively. - **precios convenientes**: convenient pricing holds a significant second position for clinics (40% for clinics in 2018, 22% for laboratories), indicating affordability is a major factor for customers in both categories. in 2015, this value was 40% for clinics and 39% for labs. - **nada, no estoy interesado**: it shows a lower interest level
