purchase with various colored segments representing different response categories with an average of 2019 indicated in the top right corner. the responses are broken down into five categories, each corresponding with a different color segment: 1. **yes, and we use it often (depicted by a darker blue segment)** 2. **yes, but we rarely use it (depicted by a lighter blue segment)** 3. **no, but we plan to buy it (depicted by an orange segment)** 4. **no, and we dont plan to buy it (depicted by a darker brown segment)** 5. **no, and we dont know if we will buy it (depicted by a tan segment)** the pie chart showcases response distributions across different years, with the latest year (2021) indicated by a lighter color and the earliest (up to 2017) by a darker shade. for each year, a corresponding categorys responses are highlighted: for 2021: - about 16% used the 3d printer frequently. - slightly under 20% rarely used it. - about 20% responded they planned to buy. - nearly 30% indicated they had no plans to buy. - approximately 14% were unsure. for 2020: - just under 27% used it frequently. - 24% rarely used it. - nearly 40% planned to buy. - about 25% had no plans to buy. - about 8% were unsure. for 2019: - approximately 19% used it often. - slightly over 32% rarely used it. - more than 30% planned to buy. - about 20% had no plans to buy. - roughly 9% were unsure. for 2018: - a bit under 22% used it often. - 33% rarely used it. - nearly 55% planned to buy. - about 29% had no plans to buy. - around 12% were unsure. for the earlier years (up to 2017): - just over 15% used it often. - over 35% rarely used it. - nearly 50% planned to buy. - about 24% had no plans to buy. - around 28% were unsure. the overall trend suggests a decrease in the percentage of dental practices using 3d printers frequently from earlier years to more recent ones. there is a noticeable increase in the percentage planning to buy, particularly post-2019, reflecting growing interest in 3d printing technologies in the dental field. meanwhile, the percentage of practices with no current 3d printers and no intention to buy remains consistent across the surveyed years, hovering around 30-40%.", "3d printer brands is your lab equipped with a 3d printer? 34 labo what is the brand of your 3d printer? formlabs is the most quoted brand overall, leading the penetration ranking in every

relevant to the mentioned brands (or more difficult to recognize due to the absence of a direct purchase relationship). the second image, within the context of the first, depicts a segmented bar chart showcasing the results of survey responses. ### detailed content of the second image: 1. **visuals**: - the bar chart consists of multiple horizontal bars, each representing individual ratings derived from a survey. - the bars are colored in four shades of pink, indicating varying degrees of relevance. 2. **data representation**: - **highly reputable**: the highest bar indicates a rating of 5.3, suggesting respondents found the brand highly reputable. - **innovative and at the forefront**: the bar next to it shows a rating of 4.2, suggesting moderate agreement. - **worldwide renowned**, **wide-reaching**, and **strong influence**: each subsequent bar shows smaller increments moving leftward to rates of 4.1, 3.8, and 3.6, respectively. - **affordable**, **customer-focused**, and **good price ratio**: these bars show even lower ratings of 3.5, 3.3, and 3.2. 3. **overall mean**: - the central chart shows an average rating of 4.1, depicted by a small orange circle. 4. **categorization**: - the entire set of ratings ranges from very positive (5.0) on the left, trending downwards, to neutral/less positive responses (3.0+). ### chain of thought (cot): each rating represents a separate evaluation based on subjective feedback. the highest rating indicates consensus that the brand is highly reputable. moving to the right, slightly lower ratings suggest views on more nuanced or less tangible aspects such as the brand's reach or influence. the lower ratings indicate qualities perceived as less beneficial to consumers, such as price and practicality. in evaluating this context within the broader image-1 setting, this segmented bar is a visual compact of the collected feedbacks, highlighting trends and areas of strength and weakness for the brand. the comprehensive data represented through the bars and cluster grouping reflects a multi-dimensional survey analysis. this approach ensures each opinion is contextualized within a broader evaluative framework, enhancing the clarity and utility of the survey's outcome. the image contains a snippet of text listing a series of statements alongside a legend that categorizes each statement as

visually using a dotted vertical line to indicate a median satisfaction value for the overall assessment of open technologies. the image contains a graph depicting molecular structures and associated numerical values. the molecular structure consists of carbon and hydrogen atoms forming a chain with double bonds indicating the presence of alkene. each molecule is represented by a unique set of numbers and symbols: the first molecular structure starts at the left and has the number values 6,8,9,7,7,8,6,78, which correspond to the atomic or molecular weights. the numbered connections represent chemical bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms, indicating their relative positions in the chain. the sequence of numbers (6, 8, 9, 7, 7, etc.) might signify weight assignments or functional group identifiers in the compound. each molecule terminates towards the right and is arranged in a continuous series, showing a systematic increase and decrease in numerical sequence, implying variations in structural isomers or functional group substitutions. the graph uses a color gradient from cyan to purple to distinguish between different values, highlighting differentiation in molecular compositions and possibly their characteristics or activities. this type of visualization could be used in scientific research for comparative analysis of molecular structures in a biological, chemical, or pharmaceutical context. the image contains a detailed graphical representation of the satisfaction levels of survey respondents concerning the features of open technologies and their overall performance. it appears to be extracted directly from the first image. the second image specifically highlights the frequency of software updates and the costs associated with these updates. it shows two sets of bar graphs positioned next to each other, each corresponding to the satisfaction levels of users on these two aspects: the left side shows the percentage of respondents who indicated various satisfaction levels for the frequency of software updates (presumably ranging from 'basically satisfied' to 'not at all satisfied' and 'no clue'). there is a noticeable distinction in satisfaction levels, with a significant number of users rating the updates as 'basically satisfied.' the percentage is divided into different sections, represented by colors ranging from yellow at least partially to green for those who are'very satisfied.' the right side shows the percentage of respondents with varying satisfaction levels concerning the costs of software updates. similar to the left side, this graph also shows different levels of satisfaction with green indicating the highest level of satisfaction. the cost aspect indicates that for a large percentage, the updates are seen as very costly, while others are quite satisfied, likely due to the perceived value and effectiveness of the updates. the data is visually laid out in a comparative format within a single panel for easy comparison. each section is neatly segmented, and the colors differentiate between levels of satisfaction, creating a clear visual hierarchy of responses.", "caracter\u00edsticas

(clinics) and \"laboratorios\" (labs) in terms of digital technology providers' offerings. the data is presented in two categories: \"clinica + labo\" combines the values of both clinics and labs, and \"laboratorio\" specifically shows lab values. the graph is color-coded with brown representing values from 2018 and yellow representing values from key features of the bar graph include: 1. **orientation**: the x-axis represents various characteristics deemed important, such as \"formaci\u00f3n, informaci\u00f3n, prueba productos, simplificaci\u00f3n\" (training, information, product testing, simplification), \"precios convenientes\" (convenient prices), \"nada, no estoy interesado\" (i don't care for anything), \"mejorar las relaciones\" (improving relationships), \"mejorar las\u6027\u80fdes\" (improving performance), and \"otro\" (other). the y-axis shows the percentage of respondent values with varying heights indicating the importance given to each characteristic. 2. **comparative data analysis**: - **formaci\u00f3n, informaci\u00f3n, prueba productos, simplificaci\u00f3n**: the most critical aspect for both clinica and lab data in 2018 is training, information, product testing, and simplification, with 53% and 43% for \"clinica + labo\" and \"laboratorio\" respectively. this demonstrates that the demand for information and product integration remains high. by 2015, this factor retained significant importance with 38% and 39% respectively. - **precios convenientes**: convenient pricing holds a significant second position for clinics (40% for clinics in 2018, 22% for laboratories), indicating affordability is a major factor for customers in both categories. in 2015, this value was 40% for clinics and 39% for labs. - **nada, no estoy interesado**: it shows a lower interest level over time. for \"clinica + labo,\" it decreased from 2015 to 2018 (15% to 7%), and for laboratories, from 17% to 7%. - **mejorar las relaciones** (improving relationships) and **mejorar las performancees** (improving performance): only 6% and 4% of clinics preferred these aspects by 2018, lower than previous trends of 6% and 8% in labs saw a minor drop, from 3% to 2% and 2% to 0%. - **otro**: remains a minor yet notable aspect, with 5% for \"clinica + labo\" and 7% for labs in 2018. *insights**: overall, the graph highlights that the integration and streamlined processes of digital solutions, combined with convenient pricing, are significant for both clinics and laboratories, with less emphasis on specific personal relationships or less defined enhancements. this data could be crucial for technology vendors to tailor their offerings based on these observed trends. the image contains a bar graph that compares the characteristics preferred by providers of medical laboratories in the years 2015 and 2018 regarding the use of digital technology. the graph is divided into two sections: one for clinics and another for clinic + lab, indicating a breakdown by type of facility. each section includes features rated by the providers and their corresponding percentage from the years 2015 and the background of the bars alternates between yellow for 2015 and brown for 2018 to visually differentiate the data from each year. 1. **clinics** - **formaci\u00f3n e informaci\u00f3n (training and information)**: - 2018: 53% - 2015: 38% - **precios convenientes

portion of the pie chart, approximately 80%, indicating that a vast majority of those surveyed are not aware of the availability of 3d printing technology in dentistry. the chart provides an interesting comparison between public awareness of 3d printing technology in general and its availability and use within the dental industry. in the context of the first image, this pie chart shows that although the majority is aware of 3d printing (82%), a significant portion (80%) lacks awareness even of its applications specifically in dentistry. this awareness gap highlights a potential area for education and promotion within the dental community. the image contains a pie chart with two categories labeled \"yes\" and \"no.\" the \"yes\" category is marked in light blue and occupies the majority of the chart, representing 78% of the responses. the \"no\" category is in dark purple, representing 22% of the responses. there is no legend or further context provided within the chart, leaving the specific subject matter of the survey open to interpretation. the chart is a simplified and clean visual representation typically used in summarizing survey results. the image contains a bar graph depicting the awareness levels regarding 3d printing in general in five different countries. the horizontal x-axis represents the countries while the vertical y-axis indicates the percentage of awareness. the five countries represented are de (germany), fr (france), it (italy), sp (spain), and uk (united kingdom). each country has two bars aligned against it, signifying a split analysis of awareness regarding 3d printing technology in general and 3d printing in dentistry specifically. for each country, there is a shorter purple bar representing the awareness level on 3d printing technology in general and a taller light blue bar representing the awareness level on 3d printing in dentistry. for instance, in germany (de), 21% are aware of 3d printing in general, with 79% aware of 3d printing in dentistry. conversely, in the united kingdom (uk), 39% are aware of 3d printing in general, with only 61% aware of 3d printing in dentistry.", "scenario: 3d printing awareness are

printing awareness generally is higher among technicians than among dentists, and again the lowest grade of awareness about the availability of 3d printing in dentistry is from uk, like it happened in the sample of dentists. the second image displays a bar chart titled \"3d printing awareness\" comparing the awareness level of three-dimensional printing technology among dentists across various countries. the x-axis represents different countries (abbreviated as de, fr, it, sp, uk, which stand for germany, france, italy, spain, and the united kingdom, respectively), and the y-axis represents the percentage of awareness, ranging from 0% to 100%. the chart includes two pairs of bars for each country: the lighter blue bar represents the percentage of dentists who are aware of 3d printing technology. the gray bar represents the percentage of dentists who are aware of the availability of 3d printing technology specifically in dentistry. for each country, the following observations can be made: germany (de): 100% of dentists are aware of 3d printing general technology, whereas 92% are aware of its use in dentistry. france (fr): 100% awareness of 3d printing technology; 16% awareness of 3d printing in dentistry. italy (it): 84% aware of general 3d printing technology; 18% aware of 3d printing in dentistry. spain (sp): 82% aware of 3d printing technology; 18% aware of 3d printing in dentistry. united kingdom (uk): 79% aware of 3d printing technology; 21% aware of 3d printing in dentistry. this visualization helps in understanding the disparity between the general awareness of 3d printing technology and its specific application in dentistry among dentists across different european countries. the image contains a pie chart labeled \"no\" with 8% of the pie colored gray and the rest labeled \"yes\" with 92% colored white. the chart is set against a plain background with no additional annotations or text. the chart specifically represents a statistic or survey result concerning a yes-or-no question regarding 3d printing technology awareness among a surveyed group. the significant majority, 92%, are identified as being aware of the technology whereas a smaller segment, 8%, are not aware. this pie chart is placed towards the bottom left of an infographic, with the heading \"are you aware of the 3d printing technology?\" placed above it for context, indicating that it's a component of a larger survey or study addressing technological awareness. the image contains four distinct bar graphs arranged in two columns, indicating various percentages for different countries and a segment of those bar graphs colored differently from the others. from left to right, starting with the first column: the first bar is fully colored in blue, with 100% written above it. this suggests that all participants in this segment were aware of 3d printing technology. the first bar in the second set is colored in purple with 18% written below it. this indicates that 18% of the respondents were not aware of 3d printing technology, contrasting with the fully colored blue bar above it which signifies full awareness. the third bar is also blue but now labeled with 23%, which could imply a gap or a continuation in percentage understanding of 3d printing awareness compared to the column on the left, where all represented in blue. the right column: the first bar is in a vivid blue with 82% written, showing similar awareness. the second bar is purple and indicates 12%, suggesting 12% are not aware of 3d printing technology, again in contrast with the fully blue bars above them. the third bar is also blue with 88% written, consistent with the first column for the same awareness level. the fourth bar is more striking in its deep purple as it only shows 4% unaware, with 96% fully aware, making the lowest percentage of unawareness among the presented categories, potentially highlighting a unique situation or understanding within that particular group. the base notation indicates that 722 cases were used as a base for this data collection, showing the sample size's significance for the study. the image is from page 22 indicated at its lower right corner and its associated with a publication by omnivision digital and key-stone. the combination of these bar graphs with different colors and percentages effectively contrasts and illustrates varying levels of 3d printing awareness among different populations or subgroups, underscoring how general 3d print awareness diverges in dental environments versus general awareness. the image contains two similar pie charts, both depicting the level of awareness regarding 3d printing technology. the key differences between the two charts lie in the types of questions they cover and the specific details for two countries - germany (de) and the united kingdom (uk). at the top-left corner of the image, it poses a question: are you aware of the 3d printing technology? below this, there is a pie chart representing the responses from germany (de) and the united kingdom (uk). the pie chart shows: yes (93%): represented by a large blue segment indicating the proportion of respondents who are aware of 3d printing technology. no (7%): represented by a small purple segment indicating the proportion of respondents who are not aware. at the top-right corner of the image, there is another question: are you aware of the availability of 3d printing technology in dentistry as well? below this question, there is another pie chart representing the responses from germany (de) and the united kingdom (uk). this pie chart shows: yes (92%): a large blue segment, slightly smaller than the yes segment from the first question. no (8%): a small purple segment. beneath these two pie charts is an explanatory note stating: \"3d printing awareness generally is higher among technicians than among dentists, and again the lowest grade of awareness about the availability of 3d printing in dentistry is from uk, like it happened in the sample of dentists.\" in summary, the pie charts in the first image provide a comparative view of the awareness levels regarding 3d printing technology and its availability in dentistry across two specific regions germany (de) and the united kingdom (uk). the charts highlight a high level of awareness regarding the technology but suggest varying degrees of awareness regarding its application particularly in dentistry, with the uk showing lower awareness. both charts clearly demonstrate these trends visually through their distinct blue and

labs to obtain a recommendation regarding intraosseous (io) scans, labeled as \"frequency of doctors approaching labs about io scan recommendation.\" specifically, it presents data for five different countries: germany, france, italy, spain, and the united kingdom. each country is depicted as one bar, consisting of two main segments: 1. **blue bar (larger segment)**: represents the frequency and type of approach (never, very seldom, monthly, weekly, daily). - *never*: germany (7%); italy (5%); uk (8%) - *very seldom*: france (5%) - *monthly*: germany (12%), france (27%), italy (18%), spain (5%), uk (7%) - *weekly*: germany (22%), france (12%), italy (22%), spain (8%), uk (9%) 2. **dark blue bar (smaller segment)**: represents the frequency of io scan recommendations: - *germany*: 18% - *france*: 20% - *italy*: 29% - *spain*: 28% - *uk*: 18% additional details: there is a pie chart accompanying the bars, showing the percentage distributions for a combined dataset: - 50%: never - 45%: very seldom - 3%: monthly - 18%: weekly - 22%: daily the base for all the bars is 594 cases, as noted at the bottom. there are additional descriptive notes explaining the data, including the fact that these laboratories are approached with a certain frequency, and the frequency of io recommendations varies across countries with differences in lab size and digitization level influencing these frequencies. this visual information contrasts between different countries' approaches concerning io scan recommendations, illustrating how digitalization levels and lab sizes influence the frequency of such recommendations. the image contains a pie chart titled \"frequency of doctors approaching labs about ios recommendation.\" the chart divides the responses into five categories, which are depicted by different colored segments. the five categories and their associated colors are as follows: never (light lilac) very seldom (light blue) monthly (blue) weekly (darker blue) daily (purple) the distribution across these categories is as follows: never: 50% in light lilac. very seldom: 18% in light blue. monthly: 22% in blue. weekly: 6% in darker blue. daily: 3% in purple. the chart is

least a technician at your practice? 10 base: 1000 cases germany shows a higher penetration of dental practices with technicians. the image contains a bar graph titled \"scenario: number of dental technicians and laboratories\" focusing specifically on whether dental professionals have at least one technician at their practice, based on data collected from different countries. the main title above the graph reads: \"do you have at least a technician at your practice?\" this title indicates the subject of the study, which is the availability of dental technicians across various countries. the bar chart has two major columns each associated with two colors: a darker blue representing 'no', indicating that no dental technicians are available, and a lighter blue representing 'yes', indicating the presence of at least one dental technician. ### breakdown of the data: 1. **germany (de)**: - no (darker blue): 69% - yes (lighter blue): 31% 2. **france (fr)**: - no: 93% - yes: 7% 3. **italy (it)**: - no: 91% - yes: 9% 4. **spain (sp)**: - no: 97% - yes: 3% 5. **united kingdom (uk)**: - no: 95% - yes: 5% the darker blue bar (indicating 'no') is significantly higher than the lighter blue bar (indicating 'yes') in every country listed, suggesting that a very low percentage of these professionals own at least one dental technician. specifically: germany shows a 31% yes/no variation (31% have at least one dental technician). france stands with the lowest percentage, with only 7% having a technician. italy shows a 9% yes/no variation (9% have a technician). spain has the least variation, with only 3% having a technician. the uk has the second lowest percentage with only 5%. ### additional insights: 1. **germanys comparison**: - the 31% variation shows a modest presence of dental technicians in comparison to other countries. - this indicates germanys relative focus on integrating dental technicians into dental practices, albeit not widespread. 2. **frances lowest percentage**: - the 7% figure implies that dental technicians are either non-existent or very rarely used in french dental practices, potentially due to different professional norms or regulations. - this could reflect a cultural or systemic barrier to integrating dental technicians within the country. 3. **general trend**: - an overwhelmingly high percentage of dental practitioners in all countries surveyed indicate no dental technicians. it suggests a significant gap in dental practice standards or available resources within these regions. - the minimal percentage of affirmative responses may point toward a need for greater recognition and adoption of dental technologies that require technicians. ### conclusion: the second image provides a clearer and more precise focus on the national distribution of dental technician availability. it demonstrates a widespread gap in dental technician integration across the listed countries, highlighting potential areas for policy changes and professional development. the stark contrast between the 'yes' and 'no' bars underscores the necessity for focused efforts to promote the professional role of dental technicians in enhancing dental care standards. the image contains a pie chart that breaks down the scenario of the number of dental technicians and laboratories, focused on whether dental practices have at least one dental technician or not. the chart shows the data on two regions: germany (abbreviated as de) and a collective representing various other countries (abbreviated as country). the main sections of the pie charts are labeled as \"no\" and \"yes,\" with respective percentages. in the chart for germany (de), the \"no\" section of the pie chart is larger and it accounts for 33% of the response. the \"yes\" section is significantly smaller, accounting for 28% of the responses. both these percentages are marked in blue. in the chart for other countries (country), the \"no\" section is much larger dominating 89% of the responses, while the \"yes\" slice is tiny, representing only 11% of the responses. these pie charts are meant to compare the prevalence of dental technicians in different areas. it clearly indicates that while a noticeable number of dental practices in germany have a technician (28%), significantly fewer have them than the other countries represented (only 11%). this stark difference suggests that dental technology is more integrated or mandated in germany compared to other countries surveyed, with majority of the other countries not having or having very few dental technicians at their practices. overall, the second image in context of the first one, emphasizes the variation in the availability of dental technicians across different regions and countries, with germany showing a relatively higher adoption and penetration of dental technicians in dental practices.", "sample segmentation: number of practicing dentists mean overall mean: 3,1 dentists 9 cases

slide shows the breakdown by geographical area. please note, the indirect restorations (veneers, inlays and onlays), are not included in the new cases of fixed prosthetics. it should be noted that the used opinion poll approach, which does not include the responses of \"non clinic owners, is not totally representative of the actual stratification of the reference universe with regard to the type and size of the dental practices. therefore, this methodology does not allow for the projection of the mean values of the sample on the reference universe in order to assess the total market. 4,3 18,6

orthodontic therapies, it has been decided to investigate the number of treatments carried out in the clinic regarding fillings/restoration, oral hygiene/scaling, fixed protheses, implants, veneers, inlays/onlays and professional whitening. base: 1.061 cases the image contains a chart that shows the breakdown of the average number of treatments per month across different categories compared to the overall mean values shown in the first image. the chart is categorized into four sub-categories: fillings/restorations, oral hygiene/scaling, new cases of fixed prosthesis, and implants. *fillings / restorations**: up to 25: 31% from 26 to 60: 32% more than 60: 37% *oral hygiene / scaling**: up to 25: 34% from 26 to 60: 32% more than 60: 34% *new cases of fixed prosthesis**: up to 25: 33% from 26 to 60: 32% more than 60: 35% *implants**: up to 25: 18% from 26 to 60: 26% more than 60: 34% the first chart in the first image provides a detailed overview of the total number of treatments performed monthly, broken down by categories, giving the average monthly production (84.7 for fillings / restorations and 73.2 for oral hygiene/scaling) for clinics overall. the second chart in the image correlates these averages with the specific frequency ranges of these treatments. the image contains a chart labeled \"new cases of fixed prostheses,\" which is an extraction from the larger infographic on the page, as seen in the first image. the chart is a horizontal bar graph that breaks down the data concerning the number of new cases involving fixed prostheses per month. the chart, specifically, focuses on the quantity of new fixed prosthesis cases conducted over different periods. the data is divided into three categories, each represented by a horizontal bar of different colors and lengths. 1. **less than 10 cases:** represented by a light blue bar, this category shows that 33% of the clinics reported a new number of fixed prosthesis cases falling below ten cases per month. 2. **from 10 to 19 cases:** represented by a dark blue bar, this category has a slightly shorter bar than the first one, indicating that 32% of clinics reported having new fixed prosthesis cases ranging between ten and nineteen cases per month. 3. **20 or more cases:** represented by the darkest blue bar, this category shows that 35% of clinics reported having at least twenty new fixed prosthesis cases per month. this category has the longest bar, signifying the highest percentage. each category is labeled with a corresponding color code and a percentage, making the distribution of new cases crystal clear. the use of gradient colors (light to dark blue) could indicate an increase in the number of cases from left to right. the overall color-coding scheme enhances visual comprehension, ensuring that readers can easily recognize and compare the quantities without confusion. the chart's conciseness and clarity provide a quick and impactful snapshot of the data, allowing for an easy comparison of the proportion of clinics experiencing new cases within different ranges. the image shows a bar chart that provides specific data on the distribution of different types of dentistry treatments performed monthly. this information is presented within the context of the larger content on the page, which appears to focus on dental procedures. the bar chart is designed to visualize the percentage of specific treatments (such as fillings/restorations, oral hygiene/scaling, implant, veneers, indirect inlays/onlays, and professional whitening) in various regions. *image

**utilizamos impresi\u00f3n 3d** (we use 3d printing) - these individuals use 3d printing and most likely utilize it in their daily practice. 2. **light blue bars**: - **lo usamos ocasionalmente en el pasado, pero ya no lo hacemos** (we used it occasionally in the past, but no longer do it) - these individuals occasionally used 3d printing in the past, but it is not a current practice. 3. **purple bars**: - **estoy familiarizado con sus beneficios y usos, pero nunca lo probe** (i am familiar with its benefits and uses, but have never tried it) - these individuals are aware of the benefits and uses of 3d printing, but they have not personally tried it. 4. **gray bars**: - **conozco la impresi\u00f3n en 3d pero no estoy familiarizado con sus beneficios y usos** (i know about 3d printing but am not familiar with its benefits and uses) - while aware of 3d printing, these individuals are not familiar with its advantages or common applications. 5. **sandy beige bars**: - **nunca escuche de eso** (i have never heard of it) - these individuals have not come across or heard of 3d printing. each of these codes helps to classify the responses of clinicians and laboratories in the first image. the image contains a donut chart showing the concordance and usage of 3d imaging in clinical and laboratory settings. it is presented within a larger context of text and infographics. the particular focus here is the donut chart detailing the responses from clinical settings. the donut chart is labeled \"clinicas,\" indicating data from clinic-based responses. it illustrates three key statistics using different shades and colors: 1. **39%** -

there will not be any change at all: the higher one is from spain, italy and france. again, the stance of german respondents is quite different from the other countries, where a higher share of respondents believe that the dentists will need to get more expert about prosthetics. the image contains a pie chart depicting the responses to a survey question regarding the future roles of dentists and technicians, specifically in relation to digital technologies. the pie chart is divided into four distinct sections, each representing a different percentage of the total responses: 58% of respondents believe that \"there will not be any change at all, because everyone will always have its own distinct role\" (indicated in light blue). 21% of respondents think \"the dentists will need to get more expertise about prosthetics\" (demonstrated in dark blue). 19% believe \"the dentists will need to get more expertise about prosthetics, because they will be required to perform part of

is the largest, taking up 35% of the pie chart. the dark blue segment is the next largest, making up 34%. the gray segment is the smallest, comprising only 7% of the pie chart. the darkest blue segment is 34%, but it is not segmented into two smaller portions by the legend, suggesting that the largest segment (35%) includes other categories not specified. the legend at the bottom explains the data with three primary statements: the relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad processing. the relationship will become blander because the cad processing will be even easier and it does not require specific expertise from the dentists. the relationship with the industry will become tighter because of the need for case-specific manufactured products and services. the overall chart conveys that, out of the surveyed group, 35% believe the relationship will tighten due to high specialization on specific tasks, 34% think it will tighten because of industry-specific product needs, and 7% think it will become blander due to easier cad processing. the largest portion, representing 35%, falls into the category of tighter relationships, illustrating a significant majority opinion on the matter. the image contains a bar chart titled \"scenario: change in the relationship among dentists, technicians, and

indicating the reduction in buying intention including orthodontists, stating: \"the buying intention \"certainly yes\" of 5% is reduced to 4.5% including orthodontists.\" further, a pie chart to the left side of the above text provides a visual summary of those with \"certainly no\" intentions, making up 32%, \"probably no\" intentions constituting 33%, and a significant portion of responses indicating \"probably yes\" or \"certainly yes\". overall, the visual representation indicates a nuanced distribution of buying intentions across different demographics and contexts within the dental practice community.", "number of dental technicians and laboratories do you have at least a technician at your practice? 11 if yes, how many? if not, how many laboratories do you cooperate with? mean: 1,2 dental technicians mean: 2,2 external laboratories (vs. 2,0 in 2015) base: 281 cases (whole sample) clinic 22 cases 22 cases there is no significant change in comparison to year 2015 (9% of surgeries stating to have at least one technician). the image contains a pie chart that is part of a larger presentation concerning the number of dental technicians and laboratories in dental practice. specifically, this pie chart is situated at the bottom left of the page and is labeled \"omnivision, digital\" at the bottom, indicating the organization responsible for the data. the chart is titled \"do you have at least a technician at your practice?\" the pie chart clearly displays two segments. the larger segment, in blue, constitutes 92% and is labeled \"no, we cooperate with an external laboratory.\" this indicates that the majority of respondents, 92% of dental professionals, do not have a technician at their practice but instead work with an external laboratory. in comparison, the smaller segment of the pie chart, in dark orange, constitutes 8% and is labeled \"yes.\" this segment shows that 8% of dental professionals have a technician working directly at their practice. adjacent to the pie chart, on the left side of the image, there is additional information indicating that 259 dental practices had no technician and 22 dental practices had a technician, with the remaining practices cooperating with an external laboratory (as explicitly stated by 92%). above the pie chart, there is text that summarizes: \"there is no significant change in comparison to year 2015 (9% of surgeries stating to have at least one technician).\" this suggests that the distribution of having a technician at the time of this survey is quite similar to the situation in 2015, with a slight overall decrease, though largely staying consistent. on the right side of the pie chart, the image also includes a pie chart titled \"if yes, how many?\" where 86% of respondents have 1 technician, 14% have 2 or more technicians, with a noted mean of \"1.2 dental technicians.\" the text clarifies that if the response was 'no,' then the additional question is how many external laboratories do they cooperate with, showing a mean of \"2.2 external laboratories (vs. 2.0 in 2015).\" there are four different bars corresponding to the number of external laboratories: 1 lab (31%), 2 labs (37%), 3+ labs (32%), and dont know/no answer (11%). thus, the pie chart emphasizes that although a technician is present in only 8% of dental practices, there is significant external laboratory collaboration, predominantly involving 2 or more laboratories. the image contains a pie chart divided into two sections, with one large segment in dark blue and a smaller segment in light blue. the dark blue portion of the pie chart is labeled with \"86%\" and the light blue portion with \"14%.\" the image is titled \"number of dental technicians and laboratories,\" indicating that it specifically references the distribution of 11 dental technicians at 281 cases evaluated. the contextual linkage provided by the surrounding text suggests that the percentage 86% corresponds to practices that have no technicians and instead rely on external laboratories. in alignment, the light blue 14% indicates practices that have at least one dental technician within the surveyed settings. the image contains a pie chart titled \"number of dental technicians and laboratories.\" the pie chart is divided into four distinct segments, each representing a different aspect of healthcare facility surveys: 1. **first segment (dark blue)**: - percentage: 31% - text: \"if not, how many laboratories do you cooperate with?\" - this segment illustrates the proportion of respondents who do not have at least one dental technician at their practice, and then proceed to discuss the number of laboratories they cooperate with in external networks. 2. **second segment (light blue)**: - percentage: 37% - text: \"mean: 2.2 external laboratories (vs. 2.0 in 2015)\" - this segment indicates that 37% of the respondents cooperate with external laboratories, and the mean number of external laboratories used is 2.2, which is an increase from the previous year's data of 2.0. 3. **third segment (dark blue)**: - percentage: 32% - text: \"if yes, how many?\" - this segment captures the respondents who answer 'yes' to having at least one dental technician, and it then details the number of dental technicians they employ. 4. **fourth segment (blue)**: - percentage: 14% - text: \"mean: 1.2 dental technicians\" - this segment informs us that 14% of respondents use more than a few dental technicians, with a mean of 1.2 dental technicians per practice that employs one. the overall message conveyed by the pie chart is to illustrate the distribution of dental technicians and laboratories among surveyed respondents, emphasizing both internal and external cooperation aspects. the second image presents a pie chart related to the number of external laboratories with which dental practices in the given study collaborate. this chart specifically addresses the 259 cases surveyed in the study, detailing the distribution of external laboratories these practices partner with. the data is segmented into categories concerning the number of external laboratories: 1 external laboratory 2 or more external laboratories the pie chart is color-coded for ease of understanding, featuring: **dark blue** for practices collaborating with only one external laboratory (32%). **light blue** for practices collaborating with two or more external laboratories (31%). furthermore, the mean number of external laboratories (noted as 2.2 in the studys 2015 data comparison) provides a reference for the distribution observed. also included in the chart is an additional color-coding key at the bottom: **dark blue** represents 1 external laboratory. **light blue** indicates 2 or more external laboratories. **unknown / no answer** with a corresponding gray segment. the chart's key clearly differentiates the collaborated laboratory types, illustrating the preference or requirement for multiple collaborations. in summary, this pie chart provides a visual representation of the external laboratory collaboration practices among dental surgical services, reflecting an increase in partnerships in 2015 as compared to previous years. the distribution highlights a significant portion of practices collaborating with two or more laboratories, indicating a trend towards enhanced collaboration in their process of handling surgeries.", "the image contains an infographic with a pie chart and bar charts, which are part of a larger visual report titled \"penetration of technology\" by key-stone network. the infographic's focus is on the adoption and integration of 3d printers within dental practices. ### pie chart analysis the pie chart at the top of the image represents \"penetration of technology.\" it's divided into four segments: 1. **yes, and we use it often (51%)** - represented in dark blue, indicating that more than half of the dental units surveyed already own and frequently use 3d printers. 2. **yes, but we rarely use it (27%)** - shown in lighter blue. 3. **no, but i intend to purchase it by the end of 2024 (6%)** - indicated in a dark grey. 4. **no, but i may purchase it from 2025 or later (10%)** - highlighted in an even lighter grey. 5. **no, and i do not intend to purchase it (3%)** - shown in a nearly unnoticeable grey, and it's the smallest section. ### segment explanation **more than one in ten dentists** own 3d printers, but those who are non-owners indicate a stronger intention to acquire them in the future. **practices with three or more dental units** show increased penetration (21%), suggesting that larger dental practices are more inclined to integrate this technology. dental practices utilizing other digital technologies, such as smile design systems and surgical planning software, also tend to adopt 3d printers more frequently. ### bar charts analysis the bar charts beneath the pie chart detail \"intention to buy\" with regards to the number of dental units and attitudes toward digital technology: 1. **no:** - **1 dental unit**: 98% do not intend to buy - **2 dental units**: 89% do not intend to buy - **3 or more dental units**: 79% do not intend to buy - **supporters**: 78% do not intend to buy - **beginners**: 88% do not intend to buy - **skeptics**: 99% do not intend to buy these segments show a uniformly high proportion of dentists across different practice sizes and attitudes toward digital technology who have no intention to buy 3d printers. 2. **yes:** - **1 dental unit**: 11% will buy - **2 dental units**: 21% will buy - **3 or more dental units**: 16% will buy - **supporters**: 22% will buy - **beginners**: 12% will buy - **skeptics**: 1% will buy - **users**: 18% will buy - **prospects**: 13% will buy - **rejectors**: 100% will buy ### detailed breakdown **single-unit dental practices** are much less likely to buy, with only 11% of those with one dental unit intending to do so. **practices with two dental units** show a modest increase, with 21% interested in purchasing. **further, larger practices with three or more units show the highest intentions for purchase at 16%**. surprisingly, **some proportion of users (18%) and prospects (13%) are also open to acquiring the 3d printers**, while an overwhelming number of rejectors (100%) are definitely not purchasing. ### analytical insight the infographic implies that larger dental practices and practices employing advanced digital technologies are more inclined to adopt 3d printers, likely due to the scale of operations facilitated by these systems. conversely, smaller dental practices and those skeptical or unfamiliar with digital technologies are less inclined to invest in 3d printing equipment. despite this, a significant minority within the larger adoption brackets still prefer not to buy, suggesting potential barriers like cost, lack of perceived need, or unfamiliarity with the technology.", "technology intention to buy: overall are you willing to purchase an intra-oral scanner, a chairside cad-cam milling unit or a 3d printing unit within 2 years? if yes, what brand(s) are

detailed comparison allows brands to assess areas they need to improve and areas of strength. the visual and numerical data effectively capture the nuances of consumer perceptions, which is crucial for brand positioning and marketing strategies. the image contains a structured comparison of the brand image perceptions across various aspects from two perspectives: three million (3m) and the average number of all brands (all brands). the comparison covers eight attributes: high reputation, high quality, long-time tradition, easiest to use, innovating company, customer orientation, friendliness, and quality/price ratio. the comparison is visually represented by stacked bar graphs, where responses are divided into five categories based on their relevance: totally irrelevant, partially irrelevant, neutral, quite relevant, and totally relevant. each category is denoted by a different color: red, orange, yellow, green, and blue respectively. for each attribute, respondents have indicated their levels of agreement with the brand statements, visually separated by data from the three million respondents and the mean data for all brands. for instance: the company's high reputation is considered relevant by 51% of 3m respondents compared to 46% of the overall all brands average. the statement about quality/price ratio shows 30% of 3m respondents rated it as \"very relevant\" while 32% of the overall average agreed on this. regarding customer orientation, 47% of 3m respondents felt this aspect was important, which is comparable to the overall average of 47%. at the bottom, the image includes a figure that likely represents the 3m average values in an infographic style, with color bands indicating the proportion of responses for each category. each stacked bar visually captures the distribution of sentiment across the different brand attributes, providing a comparative overview between the respondents and the overall brand average. the image contains a horizontal bar graph that measures customer perceptions of brand attributes for \"3m\" in comparison to \"all brands.\" the x-axis indicates different brand attributes such as high reputation, high quality, long-time tradition, and others. the left side of the graph is color-coded, and ratings range from \"totally irrelevant\" (red) to \"totally relevant\" (blue). the ratings for both \"3m\" and \"all brands\" are illustrated using colored circles for \"totally irrelevant\" (red), \"partially irrelevant\" (orange), \"neutral\" (yellow), \"quite relevant\" (green), and \"totally relevant\" (blue). for each attribute, it's clearly visible how much percentage of people rated the brand as relevant or not. the numbers inside each circle represent the percentage of respondents with this perception. the second image (the smaller one inside the first image) is a stylized line graph depicting the mean values for the attributes for both \"all brands\" and \"3m.\" each data point is marked clearly with a symbol and has its specific values labeled. these values represent the average responses in respect to each attribute. the data is visualized with line segments that connect each mean value, creating a visual trend across different brand attributes. the y-axis, indicated on the right side of the graph, runs from 3.0 to 4.5 and represents the mean values across many attributes. there appears to be a general declining trend from the 'all brands' mean values to the '3m' mean values across multiple attributes. each data points corresponding value is precise, and connections are made to show a clearer trend. the line graph and the accompanying horizontal bars together provide a comprehensive view of customer perceptions and comparisons.", "items importance + average score +

the survey question: \"how will the use of precession impression materials like elastomers (a silicons, polyethers, etc.) evolve in your practice?\" a substantial majority (over 40%) of respondents still think that traditional impression materials will continue to be widely used in dental practices despite the growing trend towards digital solutions. only a minority (10%) anticipates full replacement of traditional materials by optical impressions. this suggests a mixed scenario in which traditional technologies might coexist with new digital technologies rather than being completely replaced. in the second image, these details and interpretations are summarized with three bullet points: 1. \"they will be completely replaced by optical impressions\" represented by the color green in the first image. 2. \"they will only be used for certain indications, and over time they will play a marginal role\" represented by the color teal in the first image. 3. \"we will continue to use them for certain indications, and they will not decrease significantly\" represented by the color dark blue in the first image. the overall message reinforced by both images is that while traditional

sub-section focused on a bar chart which is part of a larger infographic. the bar chart in question presents survey results regarding respondents' agree-disagree ratings for specific statements on the impact of 3d printing in dentistry. the title at the top of this sub-section reads: to what extent do you agree on the following statements, with regard to the main consequences that 3d printing will bring to the dentistry? please rate them with fully agree, partially agree, neutral, partially disagree, fully disagree. this suggests an evaluation of the anticipated benefits of 3d printing in dental practices. the bar chart consists of three bars per statement, each using different colors to depict the percentage responses of respondents with varying levels of agreement: orange represents respondents who either fully disagree or partially disagree. yellow represents neutral responses. blue represents responses where people either partially agree or fully agree. dark blue represents respondents who fully agree with the statements. each statement includes a horizontal bar that is further divided into four segments colored to reflect the different agreement levels: the first statement: the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden - the segments are: orange (3%) and yellow (2%) for fully disagree and partially disagree, respectively; blue (26%) and dark blue (20%) for partially agree and fully agree, respectively. the second statement: the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase - the segments are: orange (4%) and yellow (4%) for fully disagree and neutrality, respectively; blue (30%) and dark blue (23%) for partially agree and fully agree, respectively. the third statement: the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks - the segments are: orange (18%) and yellow (14%) for fully disagree and partially disagree, respectively; blue (27%) and dark blue (21%) for partially agree and fully agree, respectively. additionally, this sub-section of the infographic includes two data trend analysis sections along the right side: at the top section, it shows the percentage (as 'agree') for the year 2018, followed by 2015 (with the color key specifying different agreement levels). the lower section has similar trend analysis but is not explicitly dated for the year. to the right, a graph is plotted illustrating the data comparison with a line connecting the years 2018 and 2015 for the percentage of agree responses. each segment in the bar chart, along with the percentage scale, provides specific insights into the distribution of responses, allowing readers to understand the balance between the degree of agreement and disagreement regarding the statements presented. the 3d bar segmentations help in visualizing the distribution effectively, making it easier to infer trends in public sentiment over time. the image contains a section of a study analyzing the main consequences in dentistry brought about by 3d printing, focusing on three key areas: the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden, the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase, and the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of materials compared to cad-cam blocks. the study is based on an analysis of 588 cases. the analysis is visually represented through horizontal bar graphs comparing data from two years, 2018, and 2015 (indicated as 'v. 2018 (agree)' and 'v. 2015 (yes)'), and it includes a trend analysis line graph showing the percentage of respondents (named agree) over the years. the bar graphs include responses measured from \"fully disagree\" to \"fully agree,\" which are visually represented with different colors and their corresponding percentages. specific details of the agreement rate for each statement are as follows: 1. **kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden**: - in 2018, 26% fully agreed, 20% partially agreed, and 52% neutral. - in 2015, 34% fully agreed, 23% partially agreed, and 43% neutral. 2. **the efficiency and flexibility of the workflow will increase**: - in 2018, 4% fully agreed and 30% partially agreed. - in 2015, 4% fully agreed and 30% partially agreed. 3. **the costs of the restorations will decrease because of the lower price of the materials used compared to the cad-cam blocks**: - in 2018, 18% fully agreed and 39% partially agreed. - in 2015, 21% fully agreed. the trend analysis line graph tracks the percentage of respondents agreeing from 2015 to 2018, showing a general decrease in the percentage of respondents agreeing by that metric. additionally, this section is part of a larger study report, indicated by a citation at the bottom that reads \"base: 588 cases (whole sample).\" the image is marked with page number 31 in the lower-right corner and contains the logos of omnivision and

respondents who agree with each statement was 72%, 70%, and 68% for the three statements respectively. - in 2015, the same data points were 82%, 73%, and 57% for the three statements respectively. - a line chart indicates that there is a noticeable downward trend over the years for the percentage of respondents who agree with the statements. 3. **legend:** - represented colors for different responses: - red: fully agree - yellow: partially agree - blue: neutral - light blue: partially disagree - grey: fully disagree *overall insight:** - the data is indicating a substantial shift in the perception of 3d printing's impact on dental procedures over the given time periods. - a clear decline in the number of respondents who strongly agree with statements about the broadening of materials and increasing efficiency can be observed. *background knowledge:** - 3d printing, or additive manufacturing, has been extensively integrated into the dental industry to streamline the production of dental implants, prosthetics, and other dental models. by enabling quick, customized, and economical production, it has revolutionized the workflow and material usage in dental practices. - the broadening of materials and procedures (as implied by \"the kind of materials and procedures produced digitally will broaden\") suggests that dentists can now manufacture a range of materials and components not previously accessible or cost-effective to fabricate within traditional methods, like cad-cam (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing). *technical terms and terminology used:** - **cad-cam (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing):** a process used in dentistry for designing and producing dental restorations and prosthetics. - **line chart and trend analysis:** illustrates the relationship between variables, helping visualize changes over time and make data-driven decisions. *visual elements:** - bars representing data distributions in proportions (red to grey). - a numerical breakdown for precise understanding. - a line graph representing long-term trends. *relevance of data presented:** - this analytical chart likely originates from a survey or study, providing insights into how professionals in the dental field are adapting to the advent of 3d printing technology, focusing on its impact on material flexibility, efficiency, and cost efficiency."], "test_settings": "chunk:page_chunking_embeddings:multilingual_reader-model:GPT_4o_mini"}, {"question": "What are the key factors influencing brand recommendation in Spain in

multiple barriers related to the adoption of an intraoral scanner, with each barrier rated on a three-point scale from 'not a problem' (1-6), 'quite a problem' (7-8), to 'serious problem' (9-10). the first row illustrates different economic and logistical issues respondents face when adopting an intraoral scanner. for instance, in france, 44% consider the economic investment as a serious problem while 37% perceive it as an issue, and 20% do not see it as a problem. similarly, in italy, 52% of respondents view economic costs as serious, 20% find it only a minor issue, and the remainder feel it is not a problem. spain shows a more mixed response: 22% (serious), 31% (considerable), and 47% (not a problem). the other barriers listed in the dataset include high costs for model printing, technology still evolving, and forcing the usage of certain software. the percentages of respondents rating these as serious, quite severe, or not a problem are consistent across france, italy, and spain, with similar variations in ratings. the image also contains graphs representing the mean vote (indicating the levels of concern across different issues) for each country, visually reinforcing the data in the table. france shows a trend of increasing concern from 5.5 to 6.7 in mean vote, italy moves from 4.9 to 5.4, and spain slightly increases from 6.4 to 7.3 for the same period. additionally, the graphs depict the trend over a unspecified number of years, displaying a mixed increase and decrease pattern, particularly noticeable within the purple (spain) and blue (italy) lines. overall, the second image serves as a comprehensive breakdown of how various economic and technical barriers impact the adoption of intraoral scanners in non-owner dental practices, providing detailed insights into respondent perceptions across different countries. the image shows a line graph that displays data points and trends over time for two separate countries, indicated by the different colored lines. the vertical axis is labeled 'mean vote', and the horizontal axis is marked with years ranging from 1995 to the graph features two distinct lines, one in blue and one in purple, which seem to track responses to various points, probably related to public opinion or survey scores, with data points connected by a continuous line. the blue line trend indicates values that have generally declined over time from a high of approximately 7.9 in 1995 to a low of around 4.3 in notably, the graph features a few notable peaks; one is just above 6.4 in the mid-2000s, and another peaks are around 6.9 toward the start of the next decade. the majority of this line shows a downward trajectory, suggesting a decline in the mean vote over the 18-year span. the purple line, though it crosses below the blue line, maintains more stability but experiences similar overall downward trends. the highest point on this line is around 6.2, seen in the early 2000s, before the values start to decrease more significantly. the lowest value on the purple line reaches about 4.2 in overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of changes in mean vote scores over a

category's impact on the relationship between dentists, technicians, and the industry with digital technologies. for instance, under the \"no\" category for digit. restor. provider, 32% believe that there will be no change, and 25% believe the relationship will become tighter, highlighted in dark blue. these percentages vary across each category and technology group, showing differing levels of expectation and impact perception by the respondents, who are presumably dentists, technicians, and industry members. for example, under technology, \"chairside milling\" has the highest response of 39% indicating that the relationship will become tighter. contrastingly, \"digit. restor. provider\" shows the least response with 32% and \"no\" responses at 35%. the overall structure and distribution of the bar charts suggest a comparative analysis of perceptions regarding the anticipated changes in the dynamic between dentists, technicians, and the industry, based on advancements in

on the left, the '2015' column lists reasons, such as 'too expensive' at 27%, while the '2018' column shows that 'too expensive' declines to 25%. - 'i don't need it,' 'low demand,' 'prefer traditional method,' 'poor system precision,' 'not interested,' and 'prefer technology' reasons are also present with varying percentages. - 'poor familiarity with the technology' increases 3 percentage points from 2015 to 2018. **overall trends**: - a noticeable drop in preferences over the years. - the 'low demand' and 'not interested' reasons decrease significantly, suggesting either an increase in awareness of available technologies among respondents or a less favorable reception. the second image essentially serves to quantitatively support the higher-level analysis and trends evident in the first image, painting a clearer picture of why non-ownership is prevalent in specific categories like cost, familiarity, and demand for these advanced technologies. the image contains a pie chart that presents the findings of a survey regarding the purchase intention of medical technology within two years. the chart is divided into two main segments, with the \"no\" segment being significantly larger than the \"yes\" segment. key elements of the pie chart: the \"yes\" segment, which indicates respondents who expressed interest in purchasing an intra-oral scanner, chairside cad-cam milling unit, or a 3d printing unit, occupies approximately 38% of the pie chart. the majority of the chart is occupied by the \"no\" segment, which comprises about 62%. additionally, the pie chart includes a smaller segment labeled \"if not, why?\" that displays the reasons why 62% of respondents do not intend to buy. the reasons are categorized as follows: - **too expensive**: 27% - **i prefer the traditional method**: 25% - **low demand**: 17% - **poor system precision**: 13% - **not interested**: 6% - **poor familiarity with the technology**: 3% the surrounding context from the first image provides additional insights into these trends: **bar graph: \"trend analysis\"**: presented below the pie chart, each bar represents a different year (2015 and 2018). the bars show the percentage of respondents who demonstrated a \"yes\" intent to buy, showing a slightly lower intent in 2018 compared to 2015. **text explanation**: an accompanying text highlights that interest in these digital technologies has decreased significantly, especially regarding a preference for traditional methods. the percentage of respondents concerned about the poor familiarity with the technology has also reduced. **stacked bar graph**: on the right side of the image, this graph highlights the proportion of each reason cited by respondents. the bars stack against each other, making it clear which reason is more prevalent with the largest bar representing those who consider the technology \"too expensive.\" thus, the pie chart and surrounding text collectively illustrate that while a smaller portion of respondents intend to purchase advanced dental technologies, the primary reasons behind this are financial constraints and a preference for traditional methods. the image contains two primary graphs related to survey responses regarding the purchase of advanced medical technologies over a given period. these responses are visualized in bar graphs, presenting comparative statistics between two years. ### detailed description of the image content *first graph:** **title:** the title of this main graph reads, \"technology intention to buy: overall,\" which suggests it provides an overview of general survey respondents' intentions to purchase. **source and date:** it is based on a sample of 245 cases collected in 2018. **trend analysis:** the visual representation is divided into two stacked horizontal bar graphs with labels from 2015 and 2018. - in 2015: - a more significant portion (73%) indicates that respondents did not intend to purchase. - a smaller portion (27%) indicates that they had an intention to purchase. in 2018, the proportions shifted: - a lower percentage (62%) indicated no intention to purchase. - a higher percentage (38%) indicated a desire to purchase. **overlap index explanation:** a note indicates that the differences are within +/- 2%, implying statistical insignificance, though the general trend remains clear. *second graph:** **question labels:** it appears to be a detailed breakdown of the reasons behind the buying or not buying intention. - **reasons for bought:** - too expensive: 27% (bar represents dark blue) - i prefer the traditional method: 12% (light blueish bar) - poor system precision: 13% (greenish bar) - not interested: 10% (light lavender bar) - poor familiarity with technology: 6% (more purple) - **reasons for not bought:** - i don't need it: 38% (dark blue) - low demand: 25% (blue) - i'm retiring: 9% (light lavender) - have other priorities: 6% - other: 7% (various other colors) ### observations: 1. **survey trends over time:** - a marked reduction in those who had no intention to purchase transitioned from 2015 to 2018, suggesting an increasing interest in adopting these technologies. - the percentage of respondents indicating intention increased from 27% to 38%, indicating a shift in interest over time. 2. **rationalization of not intention to buy:** - reasons like preference for traditional methods or poor system precision were not predominant, with most non-purchasers citing needs or other priorities like low demand or non-urgency. 3. **impact of overlap index:** - the overlap index clarifies the significance beyond raw percentages, ensuring the reader understands that despite statistical differences, many non-buyers had similar reasons. ### interpretation: the overall message of the image is to showcase the shift in survey respondents' interest in purchasing medical technologies between 2015 and this can be understood more contextually through the specific reasons provided in the detailed breakdown, highlighting the nuanced factors at play. these descriptions provide a thorough overview of both the visual content and underlying data trends without generalizing but offering specific insights.", "buying intention are you willing/interested in buying an intraoral scanner to make digital prints or a cad-cam chairside milling unit within 2 years? excluding specialized orthodontics practices. 63 base: 498 cases non owners random sample the buying intention certainly yes of 5% is reduced to 4.5% including orthodontists. for respondents who claimed not to have a cad-cam equipment in their office, their future purchase intention was consulted. on the other hand, practices that already have 2 or more chairs are inclined to be more disposed to purchase. between clusters related to the patient's social class, the interest is predominantly averse, with the exception of practices with customers of a and b classes, that in 50% of answers showed to be willing to acquire a cad-cam equipment the image contains a pie chart with four segments, each representing the buying intention of dental practitioners regarding the purchase of an intraoral scanner or cad-cam chairside milling unit within two years. the chart is divided into four responses: \"certainly no\" (dark blue), \"probably no\" (light blue), \"probably yes\" (blue), and \"certainly yes\" (gray). the largest segment is blue, representing 33% of respondents who indicate a \"probably yes\" buying intention. this signifies that nearly one-third of dental practitioners are highly likely to consider purchasing an intraoral scanner or cad-cam chairside milling unit within the next two years. the next significant segment is dark blue, representing 30% of respondents with a \"certainly no\" buying intention. this means that a substantial portion, roughly one in three, are decisively against buying such equipment in the timeframe. a portion of the chart is light blue, indicating that 32% of respondents have a \"probably no\" buying intention. this suggests uncertainty among dental practitioners but slightly more likely to lean towards not purchasing. lastly, a small segment is gray, representing 5% of the respondents who have a \"certainly yes\" buying intention. this is the smallest segment, implying caution among a very small percentage of dental practitioners who are certain about intending to buy such equipment. overall, the data highlights a significant but decisive split among dental practitioners when it comes to their future purchases of intraoral scanners and cad cam milling units, with a notable number leaning towards holding off, yet with a significant proportion indicating a strong intention to proceed. the image is a bar graph titled \"buying intention\" that represents data on dental practitioner respondents' future intentions regarding the purchase of intraoral scanners or cad-cam chairside milling units within the next two years, excluding specialized orthodontics practices. the horizontal axis of the graph is divided into three main categories: age of the practice owner: - up to 40 years - from 41 to 50 years - more than 50 years number of dental chairs: - 1 - 2 - 3 or more - 4 or more social class of patients: - high /mid-high class (a/b class) - middle class (c/d class) - lower class (e class) the vertical axis lists the level of buying intention in percentage, with the following segments: certainly no: 1-5% probably no: 5-20% probably yes: 20-40% certainly yes: 40-50% each category is represented by a combination of light blue and dark blue bars: light blue indicates the proportion of respondents' intention to \"probably yes\" or \"certainly yes\". dark blue indicates the proportion of respondents' intention to \"probably no\" or \"certainly no\". for each combination of categories listed along the horizontal axis, the relative buying intentions are displayed with specific percentage values. specific data includes: for the age group \"up to 40 years\", the \"probably yes\" or \"certainly yes\" intentions are relatively higher. in practices with \"more than 50 chairs\", the percentage of practitioners who plan to \"certainly yes\" or \"probably yes\" is generally higher. among different social classes, higher social class practices tend to show higher buying intentions towards intraoral scanners or cad-cam chairside milling units within the specified time frame. at the top of the image, there is a summary section indicating the reduction in buying intention including orthodontists, stating: \"the buying intention \"certainly yes\" of 5% is reduced to 4.5% including orthodontists.\" further, a pie chart to the left side of the above text provides a visual summary of those with \"certainly no\" intentions, making up 32%, \"probably no\" intentions constituting 33%, and a significant portion of responses indicating \"probably yes\" or \"certainly yes\". overall, the visual representation indicates a nuanced distribution of buying intentions across different demographics and contexts within the dental practice community.", "intention to buy are you willing/interested in buying an intraoral scanner or a cad-cam chairside milling within 2 years?

data on whether individuals, specifically dentists and cosmetic dentistry professionals, would buy an intra-oral scanner or cad-cam milling unit, along with additional demographic information. the accompanying text indicates that the data are part of a random sample of 190 cases, from a population interested in investing in cad-cam technology. the first bar chart represents dentists aged 41 to 50 years old, divided into groups based on the number of dental chairs: up to 5 chairs: 98% of dentists aged 41 to 50 would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. 5 to 10 chairs: 98% of dentists aged 41 to 10 would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. more than 10 chairs: 98% of dentists aged 41 to 40 would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. the second bar chart represents dentists aged \"more than 50 years\" divided into groups based on the number of dental chairs: up to 5 chairs: 100% of dentists aged 50 and above would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. more than 5 chairs: 95% of dentists aged 50 and above would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. the third bar chart presents data on cosmetic dentistry professionals, divided into groups based on whether they have a partner laboratory or not, and in groups based on the number of dental chairs they have: yes, we have: - up to 5 chairs: the data for dental professionals with up to 5 chairs isnt provided. - more than 5 chairs: 98% of cosmetic dentistry professionals with more than 5 dental chairs would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. no, we do not have: - up to 5 chairs: 55% of cosmetic dentistry professionals without a partner laboratory would consider acquiring a cad-cam milling unit. - more than 5 chairs: 46% of cosmetic dentistry professionals without a partner

indicate a \"probably yes\" buying intention. this signifies that nearly one-third of dental practitioners are highly likely to consider purchasing an intraoral scanner or cad-cam chairside milling unit within the next two years. the next significant segment is dark blue, representing 30% of respondents with a \"certainly no\" buying intention. this means that a substantial portion, roughly one in three, are decisively against buying such equipment in the timeframe. a portion of the chart is light blue, indicating that 32% of respondents have a \"probably no\" buying intention. this suggests uncertainty among dental practitioners but slightly more likely to lean towards not purchasing. lastly, a small segment is gray, representing 5% of the respondents who have a \"certainly yes\" buying intention. this is the smallest segment, implying caution among a very small percentage of dental practitioners who are certain about intending to buy such equipment. overall, the data highlights a significant but decisive split among dental practitioners when it comes to their future purchases of intraoral scanners and cad cam milling units, with a notable number leaning towards holding off, yet with a significant proportion indicating a strong intention to proceed. the image is a bar graph titled \"buying intention\" that represents data on dental practitioner respondents' future intentions regarding the purchase of intraoral scanners or cad-cam chairside milling units within the next two years, excluding specialized orthodontics practices. the horizontal axis of the graph is

patients: - high /mid-high class (a/b class) - middle class (c/d class) - lower class (e class) the vertical axis lists the level of buying intention in percentage, with the following segments: certainly no: 1-5% probably no: 5-20% probably yes: 20-40% certainly yes: 40-50% each category is represented by a combination of light blue and dark blue bars: light blue indicates the proportion of respondents' intention to \"probably yes\" or \"certainly yes\". dark blue indicates the proportion of respondents' intention to \"probably no\" or \"certainly no\". for each combination of categories listed along the horizontal axis, the relative buying intentions are displayed with specific percentage values. specific data includes: for the age group \"up to 40 years\", the \"probably yes\" or \"certainly yes\" intentions are relatively higher. in practices with \"more than 50 chairs\", the percentage of practitioners who plan to \"certainly yes\" or \"probably yes\" is generally higher. among different social classes, higher social class practices tend to show higher buying intentions towards intraoral scanners or cad-cam chairside milling units within the specified time frame. at the top of the image, there is a summary section indicating the reduction in buying intention including orthodontists, stating: \"the buying intention \"certainly yes\" of 5% is reduced to 4.5%

depicts that the majority, approximately 94% of dentists offer cad-cam prostheses. the remaining 6% is further divided into two smaller segments, with 5% of the dentists being owners who have scanner and milling units, and 3% of the dentists not owning such devices and instead sending models to a provider. the image also includes a bar graph on the right side illustrating various statistics about the dentists offering cad-cam prostheses. this section is categorized into multiple factors, such as: 1. **number of chairs**: this breaks down the dentists offering cad-cam prostheses into: - 1 chair (7%), - 2 chairs (5%), - 3 or more chairs (9%), - total (3 or more chairs: 52%). 2. **low to high social class**: the social class distribution of the dentists is as follows: - high/upper (2%), - middle-middle class (22%), - middle-low class (57%), - low class (5%), - total (58% in middle-to-lower classes). 3. **monthly expenditures**: this reveals the average monthly expenditure (excluding taxes) on consumable materials: - below 2000 (9%), - 2000 to 2999 (5%), - 3000 to 4999 (9%), - 5000 to 7999 (7%), - 8000 to 9994 (23%). 4. **number of patients per week**: this segment demonstrates the weekly patient volume: - below 15 (11%), - 15 to 29 (15%), - 30 to 49 (6%), - 50 to 79 (10%), - total (42% above 15 patients per week). the overall data depicted both visually in the pie chart and numerically in the bar graph indicate a majority of dentists offering cad-cam prostheses, with the remaining smaller segments providing detailed insights into the specific distribution among different types and sizes of practices. the image contains a bar graph representing the monthly expenditure on consumable materials for cad-cam users. there are two sets of bars, each depicting the percentage of users who fall into a specific expenditure bracket. the first bar measures the percentage of users spending up to 15,000, with a total of 100% of participants falling into this category. the second bar shows the percentage of users spending more than 15,000, with a much smaller distribution, totaling 89% of participants. additionally, there is a color-coding scheme where the first bar is a solid blue and the second bar is divided into segments: a lighter blue representing 11%, and a dark blue representing 6%. this indicates the varying ranges of monthly expenditure among the users. the image contains two bar charts that illustrate the offering of cad-cam prostheses, as represented by owners of cad-cam equipment. each bar chart presents data across three different classifications of dental chairs and social classes of patients. here's a detailed description of each component: *title and header:** the top of both bar charts features the title, \"offer of cad-cam prostheses,\" followed by a subtitle or question, \"and how do you do it?\" indicating a focus on how cad-cam prostheses are offered in medical practices. *legend:** the legend below the graphs categorizes responders into different groups: - **owners (scanner only):** represented by dark blue bars - **owners chairside (scanner and milling unit):** represented by lighter blue bars - **not owner and send the models to a provider:** represented by blue bars *variables and percentages:** 1. **number of dental chairs:** - the left-most column indicates the \"number of dental chairs\" from \"1\" to \"(high/mid/high class).\" - the respective percentage percentages of owners, owner chairside, and those not owning with chairside are listed next to each column: - 1 chair: 100%; 95%; 88% - 2 chairs: 88%; 95%; 98% - 3 or more chairs: 88%; 88%; 88% 2. **social class of patients:** - each subsequent column represents the \"social class of patients.\" - they include \"d (middle)\", \"c/d (middle high class)\", \"middle class\", \"(a/b) class\", and lower class. - the percentages for each class across all groups are as follows: - d class (middle): 88%, 95%, 89% - c/d class (middle high class): 97%, 98%, 97% - middle class: 98%, 98%, 98% - (a/b) class: 100%, 100%, 100% - lower class: 88%, 88%, 88% *bars:** the bars for \"owners (scanner only)\" are usually the tops of each column, making it notable that in most categories, this group consistently represents the top offer percentage. \"owners chairside\" falls right behind them and usually shows a slightly lower but still considerable percentage. the \"not owner and send the models to a provider\" shows the lowest percentage but is relevant in each category. *pie chart (left of graphs):** a pie chart divides \"owners\" by whether they are chairside providers or not, breaking it down into 94% (without chairside) and 5% (with chairside). an intriguing piece of information from this pie chart is that owners who provide chairside service are fewer (5% compared to a substantial 94% who do not use a chairside service). *footer note:** the note, \"considering that only 42% of the sample offers cad-cam prostheses and that 4.7% of these offers include a chairside, it is calculated that there is less than 2% of cad-cam in brazil.\" base information: 239 cases *brand and source:** at the bottom right of the chart, \"key-stone\" is mentioned, likely indicating the source or brand associated with the survey or the publication of the data. this detailed breakdown of the chart reveals how the offerings of cad-cam prostheses are distributed across various group classifications by dental practitioners in brazil. it captures their reliance on ownership, capacity, and patient social status. the image contains two sets of bar graphs accompanied by accompanying texts. one graph displays detailed metrics related to the ownership and usage of cad-cam prostheses by a sample group of 239 cases, and the second bar graph shows demographic data specific to patients who use the cad-cam prostheses. the first bar graph, located on the left side of the page, features a pie chart at the top with three segments. it labels: **94%

the models to a provider**: 88%, 88% (from left to right) the accompanying text elaborates that only 42% of the sample offers cad-cam prostheses, with only 4.7% offering both the scanner and milling unit, indicating that less than 2% of cad-cam uses are in brazil. the second bar graph on the right side of the page illustrates the correlation between the number of patients serviced per week and the monthly expenditure on consumable materials per dollar spent. the key categories on the horizontal x-axis from left to right are: **number of patients per week**: up to 30, from 31 to 60, more than the key categories on the vertical y-axis (which appears in two parts) are: **monthly expenditure on consumable materials**: per 1 dollar, per $12 (separated into different percentage segments for $1 & $12). every category has blue bars representing different percentages. for details: for `up to 30` patients per week, the bars show percentages of `98%` and `2%` for monthly expenditures of $1 and $12 respectively. for `from 31 to 60` patients per week, the values are `95%` and `2%` for $1, and `5%` and `4%` for $ for `more than 60` patients per week, the figures are `88%` and `5%` for $1, and `12%` and `5%` for $ the data emphasize the higher correlation with the number of patients served, as represented by the length of the bars, especially visible in the cost associated per $ the

36.\" ### for dental practices: the bar graph for \"dental practices\" is structured with a horizontal bar format where each bar represents a percentage allocated to different factors influencing customer satisfaction. the percentage weighting is distributed as follows: - **product and service quality - 43% (depicted in blue)** - **easy practice - 21% (depicted in green)** - **management costs - 26% (depicted in red)** - **compatibility - 9% (depicted in yellow)** each factor is represented with a corresponding color indicating its respective weight in customer satisfaction analysis for \"dental practices.\" ### for laboratories: the bar graph for \"laboratories\" mirrors the same horizontal bar format, showing a different set of data. the percentage weighting is distributed as follows: - **product quality - 32% (depicted in blue)** - **support and assistance - 33% (depicted in green)** - **management costs - 18% (depicted in red)** - **compatibility - 17% (depicted in yellow)** like the \"dental practices\" graph, each factor is connected to a color signifying its impact on customer satisfaction for \"laboratories.\" *explanation and analysis**: the first bar graph indicates that for \"dental practices,\" \"product and service quality\" holds the largest weight at 43%, significantly influencing customer satisfaction. this implies that the quality and service provided by dental practices are of paramount importance to their customers. the \"easy practice\" factor comes next at 21%, showing its substantial but secondary role in overall satisfaction. this points out the importance of user-friendly processes and practices within dental practices. both \"management costs\" and \"compatibility\" make up smaller portions of satisfaction assessment, with \"management costs\" influencing slightly more than \"compatibility,\" emphasizing the significance of financial aspects in client perception. for \"laboratories,\" the \"support and assistance\" factor holds the highest weight at 33%, followed closely by \"product quality.\" this reveals that both the assistance provided and the quality of the products or services are key drivers of laboratory satisfaction among customers. \"management costs\" and \"compatibility\" play more substantial but slightly less crucial roles compared to \"dental practices\". these graphs represent a comparative analysis to identify the primary determinants of customer satisfaction for each entity type, offering significant insights into what customers value most and how their satisfaction is influenced by these various aspects.", "customer experience and loyalty metrics in laboratories labo", "customer experience and loyalty metrics in laboratories factor analysis labo", "customer experience and loyalty metrics in laboratories other indicators labo"], "test_settings": "chunk:page_chunking_embeddings:multilingual_reader-model:GPT_4o_mini"}, {"question": "What is the most significant attribute in Italy in 2019 according to the bar chart?\n\n", "true_answer": "The most significant attribute is \"innovative and at the forefront\" with a score of 0.675.", "source_doc": "../sources/OMNI_DIGITAL_ITA_19_CLI_LAB_INTEGRATED_.pdf", "generated_answer": "The most significant attribute in Italy in 2019 is \"trustworthy,\" which has the highest importance score of 0.753 according to the bar chart.

with a simple and clean design. it displays metrics of importance related to an analysis. the x-axis, which is not clearly labeled, represents various attributes, but due to the image context provided by the first image where some attributes were labeled, the x-axis can be reasonably inferred to represent the same key attributes. each entry on the x-axis has a corresponding horizontal bar which shows the level of importance assigned to the attribute: the first bar indicates importance with a value of 0.578. the second bar has a value of 0.753. the third bar has a value of 0.719. next, there is a notable entry tagged as \"not significant,\" which indicates negligible importance with a value labeled as 0 on this bar chart. the fifth bar shows importance with a value of 0.479. the sixth bar has a value of 0.407. the seventh bar indicates 0.709 importance as noted \"not significant\" in the context of the first image. the subsequent bar for importance is given a value of 0.521. next, another bar has a value of 0.340. the last bar notes the importance with a value of 0. these values are quantitatively expressed, possibly through some scoring system, to reflect consumer perception, market research, or brand image analysis pertaining to roland, as indicated by the context provided by the adjacent image (image-1). the visual design uses purple bars to differentiate each category's importance level, with a clear visual hierarchy based on the length of each bar. the higher the score, the longer the bar, signifying more significance. the overall layout of the bar chart is simple and impactful, serving the purpose of succinctly illustrating which attributes are deemed more valuable in the market. it effectively visually communicates that while some attributes (like reliability, trustworthiness, and innovation) hold considerable importance, others like being too expensive have a negligible score according to consumer sentiment. the image contains a vertical bar chart with a title and a set of data values. the chart seems to represent different aspects of a service or product that are rated according to their importance and their average score. the vertical axis (y-axis) is labeled \"items importance\" and measures the importance score, ranging from 0 to 0. the horizontal axis (x-axis) displays different aspects, such as \"reliable,\" \"trustworthy,\" \"innovative and at the forefront,\" \"makes daily practice easier,\" \"highly reputable,\" \"customer service oriented,\" \"good price quality ratio,\" \"leading company,\" \"affordable,\" \"worldwide known,\" and \"too expensive.\" each aspect has a corresponding bar that indicates its importance score. all the bars are red and measure the same average score (4.5 on the right y-axis, except for the item \"too expensive,\" which is marked as \"not significant\" next to it). the \"average score\" scale on the right y-axis ranges from 3.0 to 4.5 in increments of 0. the overall impression is that customers rate most of the aspects highly, with a consistent average score of 4.5 across the majority of categories. however, \"too expensive\" does not have a score and is explicitly marked as being not significant. the second image displays two columns with text and graphical elements. on the left column, titled \"items importance,\" it lists the significance of various factors on a brands recommendation based on user inputs or a correlation analysis. the following items are presented with corresponding numerical values: 1. **reliable - 0.578** 2. **trustworthy - 0.753** 3. **innovative and at the forefront - 0.719** 4. **makes daily practice easier - 0.479** 5. **highly reputable - not significant** the graphical elements here are horizontal bars, each colored in shades of purple, reflecting the importance ratings assigned to different attributes. the right column, titled \"average score,\" compares these ratings visually with a bar graph that contains numerical values ranging from 3.0 to 4. four bars in purple show the average scores for the listed factors: 1. **reliable - 4.3** 2. **trustworthy - 4.3** 3. **innovative and at the forefront - 4.3** 4. **makes daily practice easier - 4.1** two additional horizontal red bars show scores for the remaining items: 1. **highly reputable - 4.0** 2. **worldwide reknown - not significant** 3. **affordable - 3.5** 4. **too expensive - 4.2** the bars in each column visually represent these scores, with the average scores for \"highly reputable\" and \"affordable\" extending across the full range. the context provided in the first image indicates this data is part of a brand image analysis for a company named 'roland,' emphasizing factors like reliability,

\"waste/inefficiency.\" this suggests that while its considered important, it lacks high scores or might have waste inefficiencies. **orientato al servizio clienti (client-oriented):** also placed towards higher importance, with a moderately lower average score. it means clients consider it as crucial, but it likely doesnt score as high in performance. **azienda leader del settore (leader in the sector company):** found in a similar area, suggesting both high importance but not performing highly, indicating potential leadership but lacking high performance scores. **buono rapporto qualit prezzo (good quality/pre-price ratio):** this point is at the lower end concerning importance but near the higher end concerning average score, indicating that while it is not highly considered in its importance, it has better average scores likely due to being a better quality/pre-price ratio. on the right-hand side, categorized under items considered strengths: **affidabile (reliable):** positioned higher, indicating it has high importance and high average scores, a strong recommendation. **innovativa e all' avanguardia (innovative and at the forefront):** it shows high importance as

example: - **fr (france):** a dot plotted toward the higher end of the nearess axis, suggesting a higher emphasis on physical closeness related to reputation. - **it (italy):** positioned toward the bottom right in less relevance with lower nearess, indicating less perceived importance. - **de (germany):** slightly to the right, more focused on the nearess aspect. - **uk (united kingdom):**

reputational focus. **age <40 and age >55:** distinguished profiles with clear placements on how they relate to the market factors. the map serves to provide a nuanced understanding of how different

on the left, the '2015' column lists reasons, such as 'too expensive' at 27%, while the '2018' column shows that 'too expensive' declines to 25%. - 'i don't need it,' 'low demand,' 'prefer traditional method,' 'poor system precision,' 'not interested,' and 'prefer technology' reasons are also present with varying percentages. - 'poor familiarity with the technology' increases 3 percentage points from 2015 to 2018. **overall trends**: - a noticeable drop in preferences over the years. - the 'low demand' and 'not interested' reasons decrease significantly, suggesting either an increase in awareness of available technologies among respondents or a less favorable reception. the second image essentially serves to quantitatively support the higher-level analysis and trends evident in the first image, painting a clearer picture of why non-ownership is prevalent in specific categories like cost, familiarity, and demand for these advanced technologies. the image contains a pie chart that presents the findings of a survey regarding the purchase intention of medical technology within two years. the chart is divided into two main segments, with the \"no\" segment being significantly larger than the \"yes\" segment. key elements of the pie chart: the \"yes\" segment, which indicates respondents who expressed interest in purchasing an intra-oral scanner, chairside cad-cam milling unit, or a 3d printing unit, occupies approximately 38% of the pie chart. the majority of the chart is occupied by the \"no\" segment, which comprises about 62%. additionally, the pie chart includes a smaller segment labeled \"if not, why?\" that displays the reasons why 62% of respondents do not intend to buy. the reasons are categorized as follows: - **too expensive**: 27% - **i prefer the traditional method**: 25% - **low demand**: 17% - **poor system precision**: 13% - **not interested**: 6% - **poor familiarity with the technology**: 3% the surrounding context from the first image provides additional insights into these trends: **bar graph: \"trend analysis\"**: presented below the pie chart, each bar represents a different year (2015 and 2018). the bars show the percentage of respondents who demonstrated a \"yes\" intent to buy, showing a slightly lower intent in 2018 compared to 2015. **text explanation**: an accompanying text highlights that interest in these digital technologies has decreased significantly, especially regarding a preference for traditional methods. the percentage of respondents concerned about the poor familiarity with the technology has also reduced. **stacked bar graph**: on the right side of the image, this graph highlights the proportion of each reason cited by respondents. the bars stack against each other, making it clear which reason is more prevalent with the largest bar representing those who consider the technology \"too expensive.\" thus, the pie chart and surrounding text collectively illustrate that while a smaller portion of respondents intend to purchase advanced dental technologies, the primary reasons behind this are financial constraints and a preference for traditional methods. the image contains two primary graphs related to survey responses regarding the purchase of advanced medical technologies over a given period. these responses are visualized in bar graphs, presenting comparative statistics between two years. ### detailed description of the image content *first graph:** **title:** the title of this main graph reads, \"technology intention to buy: overall,\" which suggests it provides an overview of general survey respondents' intentions to purchase. **source and date:** it is based on a sample of 245 cases collected in 2018. **trend analysis:** the visual representation is divided into two stacked horizontal bar graphs with labels from 2015 and 2018. - in 2015: - a more significant portion (73%) indicates that respondents did not intend to purchase. - a smaller portion (27%) indicates that they had an intention to purchase. in 2018, the proportions shifted: - a lower percentage (62%) indicated no intention to purchase. - a higher percentage (38%) indicated a desire to purchase. **overlap index explanation:** a note indicates that the differences are within +/- 2%, implying statistical insignificance, though the general trend remains clear. *second graph:** **question labels:** it appears to be a detailed breakdown of the reasons behind the buying or not buying intention. - **reasons for bought:** - too expensive: 27% (bar represents dark blue) - i prefer the traditional method: 12% (light blueish bar) - poor system precision: 13% (greenish bar) - not interested: 10% (light lavender bar) - poor familiarity with technology: 6% (more purple) - **reasons for not bought:** - i don't need it: 38% (dark blue) - low demand: 25% (blue) - i'm retiring: 9% (light lavender) - have other priorities: 6% - other: 7% (various other colors) ### observations: 1. **survey trends over time:** - a marked reduction in those who had no intention to purchase transitioned from 2015 to 2018, suggesting an increasing interest in adopting these technologies. - the percentage of respondents indicating intention increased from 27% to 38%, indicating a shift in interest over time. 2. **rationalization of not intention to buy:** - reasons like preference for traditional methods or poor system precision were not predominant, with most non-purchasers citing needs or other priorities like low demand or non-urgency. 3. **impact of overlap index:** - the overlap index clarifies the significance beyond raw percentages, ensuring the reader understands that despite statistical differences, many non-buyers had similar reasons. ### interpretation: the overall message of the image is to showcase the shift in survey respondents' interest in purchasing medical technologies between 2015 and this can be understood more contextually through the specific reasons provided in the detailed breakdown, highlighting the nuanced factors at play. these descriptions provide a thorough overview of both the visual content and underlying data trends without generalizing but offering specific insights."], "test_settings": "chunk:page_chunking_embeddings:multilingual_reader-model:GPT_4o_mini"}, {"question": "What is the general perception of Voco's trust and customer orientation in Europe clinics in 2023?\n\n", "true_answer": "There is a general perception of significant relevance of Voco in terms of trusting the company more, which correlates to customer-oriented behaviors in purchasing decisions and long-standing relationships with the company.", "source_doc": "../sources/BEQ_2301_OVERALL_multi.pdf", "generated_answer": "In 2023, Voco generally enjoys a positive perception regarding trust and customer orientation in European clinics.

laboratories scored higher at 33% compared to dental practices at 21%. **management costs:** both segments scored higher in this category with laboratories at 18% compared to dental practices at 26%. **compatibility:** laboratories scored higher in compatibility (17%) compared to dental practices (9%). this comparison is designed to provide insights into which areas dental practices need to improve on to align more closely with laboratory customer satisfaction metrics, especially in technical support and product quality. the image shows two separate bar graphs side by side, each representing data for two different types of entities: \"dental practices\" and \"laboratories.\" these graphs appear to be extracted from \"key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 36.\" ### for dental practices: the bar graph for \"dental practices\" is structured with a horizontal bar format where each bar represents a percentage allocated to different factors influencing customer satisfaction. the percentage weighting is distributed as follows: - **product and service quality - 43% (depicted in blue)** - **easy practice - 21% (depicted in green)** - **management costs - 26% (depicted in red)** - **compatibility - 9% (depicted in yellow)** each factor is represented with a corresponding color indicating its respective weight in customer satisfaction analysis for \"dental practices.\" ### for laboratories: the bar graph for \"laboratories\" mirrors the same horizontal bar format, showing a different set of data. the percentage weighting is distributed as follows: - **product quality - 32% (depicted in blue)** - **support and assistance - 33% (depicted in green)** - **management costs - 18% (depicted in red)** - **compatibility - 17% (depicted in yellow)** like the \"dental practices\" graph, each factor is connected to a color signifying its impact on customer satisfaction for \"laboratories.\" *explanation and analysis**: the first bar graph indicates that for \"dental practices,\" \"product and service quality\" holds the largest weight at 43%, significantly influencing customer satisfaction. this implies that the quality and service provided by dental practices are of paramount importance to their customers. the \"easy practice\" factor comes next at 21%, showing its substantial but secondary role in overall satisfaction. this points out the importance of user-friendly processes and practices within dental practices. both \"management costs\" and \"compatibility\" make up smaller portions of satisfaction assessment, with \"management costs\" influencing slightly more than \"compatibility,\" emphasizing the significance of financial aspects in client perception. for \"laboratories,\" the \"support and assistance\" factor holds the highest weight at 33%, followed closely by \"product quality.\" this reveals that both the assistance provided and the quality of the products or services are key drivers of laboratory satisfaction among customers. \"management costs\" and \"compatibility\" play more substantial but slightly less crucial roles compared to \"dental practices\". these graphs represent a comparative analysis to identify the primary determinants of customer satisfaction for each entity type, offering significant insights into what customers value most and how their satisfaction is influenced by these various aspects.", "brand image: focus on brands - voco in your opinion, how do you rate the mentioned brands in the following areas? 58 mean voco (58 quotes) (scores: 1 totally

image. this pie chart, labeled simply as \"image-2,\" details the responses given by 594 dental laboratory cases regarding the importance of digitization within their context. the segments of the pie chart are categorized into 5 different categories, each represented by distinct colors and percentages: 1. **very important**: 34% (light blue) this segment indicates that a significant portion of the dental labs consider digitization to be extremely important. 2. **rather important**: 52% (very dark blue) a majority of labs emphasize the importance of digitization but find it not as critical as'very important.' 3. **neutral**: 11% (yellow) this smaller segment suggests that a modest portion of respondents view digital advances as neither significantly important nor unimportant, maintaining an indifferent stance. 4. **rather not important**: 3% (light green) a minor portion of labs sees digitization as unimportant. 5. **not important at all**: 3% (red orange) a smaller segment that indicates that for a few, digitization in dental labs does not at all matter. the legend is placed at the bottom of the image, providing clear labels for each segment of the pie chart. this pie chart, when viewed in the context of image-1 (the entire page), complements the accompanying textual data, which offers deeper insights into why these percentages are formed. the textual analysis in image-1 provides context, such as linking the importance ratings in each country (germany, france, italy, spain, uk) and explaining the overall digitization trends, the role of training and education, and the acceptance of digital orthopedic scanning (ios) by dental labs. together, image-1 and image-2 offer a comprehensive overview of digitalization importance within dental labs. the image contains a pie chart that analyzes the impact of digitization in the dental lab context. the chart is divided into three colored segments with corresponding percentage labels and titles. the largest segment is colored in blue and represents \"overall positive impact,\" comprising 66% of the pie chart. this segment suggests that a majority of respondents view the acceptance of ioi scans (with implications for digitization) as having a positive effect on their dental laboratory business. the second-largest segment is colored in orange and represents \"negative impact,\" making up 30% of the chart. this portion suggests that a significant minority of respondents believe that the ioi scans have had an adverse effect on their dental lab business. the smallest segment, colored in gray, represents \"no major impact,\" which comprises 4% of the pie chart. this portion of the respondents do not perceive a significant change in their dental lab business due to ioi scans. these three categories provide a comprehensive view of how dental lab professionals in the surveyed region perceive the impact of digital technologies on their industry, with a clear majority experiencing a positive change or no significant impact. the image contains a chart with the title \"what impact do you feel the acceptance of the ios scans has had on your dental laboratory business?\" the chart compares the responses from different countries regarding the impact of the acceptance of ios scans on dental laboratory businesses: **germany**: 66% feel a positive impact, 2% a negative impact, and 32% no major impact. **france**: 63% feel a positive impact, 5% a negative impact, and 31% no major impact. **italy**: 71% feel a positive impact, 4% a negative impact, and 25% no major impact. **spain**: 62% feel a positive impact, 4% a negative impact, and 35% no major impact. **uk**: 68% feel a positive impact, 4% a negative impact, and 28% no major impact. the chart uses a combination of dark blue and light gray bars to visually represent the percentage of respondents from each country. dark blue bars correspond to respondents who feel a positive impact, light gray to those with a negative impact, and beige to the respondents who perceive no major impact. the analysis in the first image suggests that the acceptance of ios scans generally has had a positive impact on dental laboratories across all the surveyed countries. however, there are some noticeable differences in the degree of positive impacts and the proportion of respondents in each country. for instance, italian respondents feel the most positive impact, while german respondents feel less positive compared to other countries. additionally, it notes that smaller labs tend to show a lower-than-average positive impact and those performing a higher number of simple fixed prosthesis cases seem to have received more positive impacts compared to labs performing fewer of those cases.", "impact of digitization on the dental labs", "20 frequency of the approaches to doctors about digitization how often do you approach your doctors about digitizing their practice with intraoral scanners? labs receiving intra-oral scan files if never, why? smaller labs bigger labs when the impact of ios scans on the lab business is positive, labs approach doctors more frequently. labs approaching dentists for the practice digitization is quite high, lower than average in the mediterranean countries. in spain, the development of digital technologies in the dental sector has accelerated significantly in the last two years, which is the reason why the percentage of laboratories approaching studies on this subject is high. the reason for not recommending varies with the size of the laboratories: small laboratories do not recommend because they do not feel adequate, while large laboratories, which are the most digitalised ones, are also the ones that can spend less time on this activity. bigger labs

is split into three segments: 1. **majority (88%)** - represented by a large blue segment. this indicates that 88% of the doctors surveyed have received or been approached for digitizing their practice. 2. **majority (12%)** - represented by a small brown segment. this suggests that 12% of the doctors have not received or been approached about digitizing their practice. additionally, the right side of the pie chart provides a bar graph indicating the percentage of labs receiving intra-oral scan files. the data is further categorized by country: - **germany**: 32% receive these files often, 60% seldom, 8% never. - **france**: 32% receive these files often, 60% seldom, 8% never. - **italy**: 41% receive these files often, 47% seldom, 12% never. - **spain**: 25% receive these files often, 33% seldom, 42% never. - **uk**: 43% receive these files often, 28% seldom, 28% never. moreover, the image highlights reasons for not recommending digitization on the basis of lab size: - **small labs**: 45% do not consider themselves digitization experts and do not feel they are in a position to advise. - **labs without digital tools**: 24% lack the necessary tools/materials to assist in discussion. - **feeling their opinion unvalued**: 7%. - **other reasons**: 13%. overall, these charts present the impact of iot scans on lab businesses, the propensity of labs in different countries to approach dentists for digitization, and common reasons for not endorsing digitization. the image contains a pie chart with three segments, each representing the frequency of doctors' approaches about the digitization process across different cases per doctor. the segments are categorized as \"never,\" \"seldom,\" and \"often,\" with specific percentages for each category. the largest segment, consisting of 51% of the pie chart, is labeled \"never.\" this indicates that over half of the doctors surveyed do not approach digitization. the second-largest segment, representing 37% of the chart, is labeled \"seldom.\" this suggests that a substantial but slightly smaller segment of doctors approach digitization sparingly. the smallest segment, taking up 12% of the pie chart, is marked \"often.\" this indicates that a smaller percentage of doctors frequently employs digitization methods. this pie chart is visually separated from the rest of the first image, positioned at the bottom. the segmentation of responses (never, seldom, often) directly correlates with the data presented above, indicating the distribution of doctor's approaches to digitalization processes. the other parts of the first image provide additional context and comparative data points, such as the comparison of frequency across different countries in europe, the reasons for not recommending digitization, and correlations between laboratory size and preference for digitization. these elements complement the quantitative insights provided by the pie chart. the image contains a bar chart that presents the frequency of approaches to dentists about digitalization undertaken by doctors in different european countries. it accompanies a more detailed infographic in the main image to provide insight into the attitudes and behaviors of dental laboratories (labs) responding to dental digitalization. the bar chart specifically focuses on three factors: the percentage of doctors who do not consider themselves digitization experts, the percentage who note a lack of time for this activity, the percentage lacking necessary tools/materials to aid in this process, and the percentage of smaller labs versus larger labs. these categories are color-coded: light blue for smaller labs and dark blue for larger labs. for germany, 11% of doctors do not consider themselves digitalization experts, 57% of smaller labs and 32% of larger labs have these concerns, suggesting a high need for improvement or professional development. in france, 9% of doctors consider themselves non-experts and both the percentages for smaller labs and larger labs (59% and 32% respectively) remain relatively high, indicating a significant need for training and support in digitalization practices. italy shows 12% of doctors not considering themselves digitization experts, with smaller labs at 41% and larger labs at 47%, pointing to a significant gap in digital skills. for spain, the data suggests only 9% of doctors are non-experts, but smaller labs report 67% lacking the necessary tools/materials, and larger labs report 25%. in the uk, 13% of doctors claim they are not digitization experts, with smaller labs showing this concern even higher at 60%, while larger labs report 28%. the overall message conveyed by this chart is that there is a high need for digital skills training in dentistry across all countries but that smaller labs tend to face more immediate challenges due to resource constraints. the image contains a bar chart with the title \"i do not consider myself a digitization expert, do not feel i am in the position to advise,\" followed by four horizontal bars. the percentages and associated reasons for not considering oneself an expert are displayed next to the bars. the first bar, which is the longest, represents 45% who do not consider themselves digitization experts. the next bar shows 30% who do not have the time to assist with digitization projects. the third bar indicates 24% who do not have the necessary tools or materials to help with digitization. the fourth bar shows 7% who do not believe their opinion has value in digitization discussions, and the fifth bar indicates other reasons, accounting for 13%.", "required features from digital technology providers what should your digital technology provider offer you, to improve and enhance the

factor analysis - europe the factor analysis (4 factors) performed on the customer satisfaction items highlighted, as happened with the recommendation, almost the same items. management costs and compatibility were exactly the same, while the first two were slightly different. in the clinical sample the quality of the product is joint to the quality of the service, thus making just one factor product and service quality, while in the sample of dental laboratories the product quality is alone and the service is part of a different factor focused on the area of support and assistance. the technical assistance and support make the difference: for the dental practices, they belong to the first factor, while for the laboratory they belong to the second one. chart customer satisfaction, multiple regression analysis - europe this analysis takes care of assessing how much the single factors affect the overall satisfaction. as previously seen in the factor analysis, the technical assistance and support look to be important, because in the sample of dental practices the first factor, which includes those items, weights far more than the other ones (43%), while in the sample of dental laboratories is the second factor again, including those factors the most important one, with 33% of weight on the overall satisfaction. the image contains a detailed report titled \"the factor

and service quality:** dental practices scored significantly higher at 43% compared to laboratories at 32%. **support and assistance:** laboratories scored higher at 33% compared to dental practices at 21%. **management costs:** both segments scored higher in this category with laboratories at 18% compared to dental practices at 26%. **compatibility:** laboratories scored higher in compatibility (17%) compared to dental practices (9%). this comparison is designed to provide insights into which areas dental practices need to improve on to align more closely with laboratory customer satisfaction metrics, especially in technical support and product quality. the image shows two separate bar graphs side by side, each representing data for two different types of entities: \"dental practices\" and \"laboratories.\" these graphs appear to be extracted from \"key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 36.\" ### for dental practices: the bar graph for \"dental practices\" is structured with a horizontal bar format where each bar represents a percentage allocated to different factors influencing customer satisfaction. the percentage weighting is distributed as follows: - **product and service quality - 43% (depicted in blue)** - **easy practice - 21% (depicted in green)** - **management costs - 26% (depicted in red)** - **compatibility - 9% (depicted in yellow)** each factor is represented with a corresponding color indicating its respective weight in customer satisfaction analysis for \"dental practices.\" ### for laboratories: the bar graph for \"laboratories\" mirrors the same horizontal bar format, showing a different set of data. the percentage weighting is distributed as follows: - **product quality - 32% (depicted in blue)** - **support and assistance - 33% (depicted in green)** - **management costs - 18% (depicted in red)** - **compatibility - 17% (depicted in yellow)** like the \"dental practices\" graph, each factor is connected to a color signifying its impact on customer satisfaction for \"laboratories.\" *explanation and analysis**: the first bar graph indicates that for \"dental practices,\" \"product and service quality\" holds the largest weight at 43%, significantly influencing customer satisfaction. this implies that the quality and service provided by dental practices are of paramount importance to their customers. the \"easy practice\" factor comes next at 21%, showing its substantial but secondary role in overall satisfaction. this points out the importance of user-friendly processes and practices within dental practices. both \"management costs\" and \"compatibility\" make up smaller portions of satisfaction assessment, with \"management costs\" influencing slightly more than \"compatibility,\" emphasizing the significance of financial aspects in client perception. for \"laboratories,\" the \"support and assistance\" factor holds the highest weight at 33%, followed closely by \"product quality.\" this reveals that both the assistance provided and the quality of the products or services are key drivers of laboratory satisfaction among customers. \"management costs\" and \"compatibility\" play more substantial but slightly less crucial roles compared to \"dental practices\". these graphs represent a comparative analysis to identify the primary determinants of customer satisfaction for each entity type, offering significant insights into what customers value most and how their satisfaction is influenced by these various aspects.", "key-stone omnivision digital

with each segment's height proportional to the percentage each response received. the image contains two main visual elements, each conveying distinct sets of information. the first portion of the first image is a bar and pie chart labeled \"relationship among dentists, technicians, and the industry in the future of digital technologies.\" the pie chart, titled \"chart 22,\" shows various percentages representing different relationships with colors corresponding to blue, navy, and yellow. a legend indicates the following meanings for these colors: blue: relationship will become tighter navy: relationship will become tighter because of the high specialization of technicians in prosthodontics and cad processing yellow: relationship with the industry becomes tighter because cad processing will be easier and does not require specific expertise from dentists dark yellow: relationship with the industry becomes tighter because of the need for customized products and services accompanying the pie chart is a detailed description explaining the trends in the relationship between dentists, technicians, and the industry in regards to digital technology adoption. the text indicates that in europe, dentists hold the relationship with the industry to remain tighter. the second part of the first image contains another bar chart titled \"chart 23\" and subtitled \"what

numerical values. the molecular structure consists of carbon and hydrogen atoms forming a chain with double bonds indicating the presence of alkene. each molecule is represented by a unique set of numbers and symbols: the first molecular structure starts at the left and has the number values 6,8,9,7,7,8,6,78, which correspond to the atomic or molecular weights. the numbered connections represent chemical bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms, indicating their relative positions in the chain. the sequence of numbers (6, 8, 9, 7, 7, etc.) might signify weight assignments or functional group identifiers in the compound. each molecule terminates towards the right and is arranged in a continuous series, showing a systematic increase and decrease in numerical sequence, implying variations in structural isomers or functional group substitutions. the graph uses a color gradient from cyan to purple to distinguish between different values, highlighting differentiation in molecular compositions and possibly their characteristics or activities. this type of visualization could be used in scientific research for comparative analysis of molecular structures in a biological, chemical, or pharmaceutical context. the image contains a detailed graphical representation of the satisfaction levels of survey respondents concerning the features of open technologies

distinction in satisfaction levels, with a significant number of users rating the updates as 'basically satisfied.' the percentage is divided into different sections, represented by colors ranging from yellow at least partially to green for those who are'very satisfied.' the right side shows the percentage of respondents with varying satisfaction levels concerning the costs of software updates. similar to the left side, this graph also shows different levels of satisfaction with green indicating the highest level of satisfaction. the cost aspect indicates that for a large percentage, the updates are seen as very costly, while others are quite satisfied, likely due to the perceived value and effectiveness of the updates. the data is visually laid out in a comparative format within a

(punt\u00e9 desde 1 \"completamente insatisfecho\" hasta 10 \"completamente satisfecho\"). this translates to \"considering each of the cad-cam brands used, rate your satisfaction with the following factors. (rated from 1 'completely dissatisfied' to 10 'completely satisfied').\" two sets of bars; on the left set (todas las marcas) contains 26 labels for analysis and bars representing different satisfaction levels, and on the right set (3shape) which presents the aggregated or average satisfaction scores within 3shape specifically. the chart includes a total of 16 different factors, each represented by a horizontal bar in the corresponding satisfaction levels, such as \"bastante satisfecho\", \"muy satisfecho\", \"no satisfecho\", \"no puede juzar\". the colors indicate from low (dark) to high (light) levels of satisfaction. the \"todas las marcas\" horizontal bar chart includes: **bastante satisfecho** in dark hues **muy satisfecho** in lighter hues **no satisfecho** in very light hues **no puede juzar** in very dark hues all labels on the left side of the 16th bar (the gray one) represent different levels of these four responses. each category has varying bar lengths across the factors. the \"3shape\" section shows average satisfaction percentages in color-coded bars (dark blue for low scores, lighter to bright blue for high scores), with individual levels annotated next to each corresponding bar (like \"bastro satisfecho\" 8% to \"muy satisfecho\" 69%). each bar in both sets is associated with specific factors of user satisfaction, such as \"facilitad de la pr\u00e1ctica diaria\", \"precisi\u00f3n y calidad global de las ferramentes\", etc. the overall layout is structured to show the detailed and aggregate responses separately and collectively. a key at the bottom correlates with the color of the bars to their specific satisfaction ratings as per the questionnaires. this detailed visual representation allows for easy comparison of satisfaction levels across different product brands and specific features within the 3shape product. the image contains a 3d molecular structure model depicting a protein or a complex molecule. this molecule is composed of numerous interconnected spheres, each labeled with specific numerical values ranging from 5 to these spheres represent atoms within the molecule, possibly indicating atomic weights, orbital numbers, or other scientific measurements. the spheres are connected by lines, suggestive of chemical bonds between atoms, forming a complex network. the varying colors of the spheres (including blue, pink, teal, and purple) might represent different types of atoms or chemical bonds, although the exact color coding is not explicitly explained in the image. the arrangement and interaction of these spheres follow a helical pattern, typical of many macromolecular structures such as proteins, where the atoms are arranged in a specific order to form a spatially efficient molecule. this is indicative of the natural order and symmetry found in molecular structures, which is essential for maintaining the stability and functionality of the molecule. the 3d model appears to be an informative diagram used in chemistry or molecular biology, likely indicating the geometric arrangement and interactions of atoms within a biological or chemical compound. this type of visual representation is crucial for understanding the spatial configuration in fields like drug design, bioinformatics, and chemical engineering. the image contains a detailed chart titled \"puntuaci\u00f3n de satisfacci\u00f3n: 3shape.\" it displays two primary sections: one section labeled \"todas las marcas\" which includes 538 mentions, and another section labeled \"3shape\" including 26 mentions. at the bottom of the chart, there's a vertical bar graph titled \"mean\" that visualizes the general satisfaction range from unsatisfied to very satisfied across all metrics. ### sections: #### todas las

labeled \"no,\" and a smaller blue section labeled \"yes\" with the percentage values 80% and 20% respectively. the background of the pie chart is white, set against a larger outer border that matches the color of the \"no\" section, creating a visual boundary between the chart and the surrounding area. the chart is overlaid on a document that contains text on the top and bottom sections, which are not part of the pie chart itself but rather provide context to it. the text at the top describes the nature of the data represented by the chart as being related to a survey about \"are you willing to purchase an intra-oral scanner within 2 years?\" beneath the chart and text, there is additional explanatory text that highlights the geographical variations of purchasing intentions and underscores the consistency of intentions across the countries studied. the overall layout uses a muted color palette with various shades of blue and grey, maintaining a professional and clean appearance. the pie chart effectively demonstrates the clear majority preference, suggesting that 80% of the surveyed individuals are not inclined to purchase an intra-oral scanner within the next two years. the second image is a bar graph titled \"technology intention to buy: intraoral scanner.\" it visualizes data from a survey showing the percentage of respondents in different countries who are in favor of purchasing an intra-oral scanner within two years. starting from the left, the first set of bars corresponds to germany (de), where 84% of the respondents are interested in purchasing an intra-oral scanner, out of which only 16% do not intend to. the next bar shows france (fr), with similar data: 85% are interested, and 14% are not. the third bar is for italy (it), with 73% interested and 27% not. the fourth is for spain (sp), where 73% are interested, and 26% are not. the fifth and final bar represents the united kingdom (uk), with 82% interested and 18% not wanting to purchase an intra-oral scanner. overall, this image uses stacked bar charts to contrast the percentages, with each bar representing a percentage of respondents in different countries who have varying levels of intention to purchase intra-oral scanners. the stacked segments alternate in shades of purple to denote percentages of intention to purchase (in dark purple) and the percentage of respondents who do not intend to buy (in light purple). the data originates from a sample of 915 cases.", "technology intention to buy are you willing to start using digital technologies within 2 years? 59 base: 311

\"technology intention to buy,\" which is part of a larger page discussing the adoption of digital technologies within the next two years. the pie chart is labeled with percentages and color segments representing different responses to the question posed. the chart is divided into three sections, with each section describing the proportion of respondents to specific responses. the three largest sectors are: 1. \"no\" - 82%: this segment is colored dark blue with a pie-like cutout to differentiate it as the majority. it represents the respondents who are not willing to start using digital technologies within the next two years. 2. \"yes\" - 12%: this segment is colored light blue, indicating the smaller but still significant proportion of respondents who are willing to adopt digital technologies. 3. \"don't know\" - 6%: this segment is shown in a lighter shade of purple, representing the respondents who are unsure or unresponsive to the question. it is a smaller section compared to the \"no\" and \"yes\" categories. accompanying the pie chart, the text indicates that germany is a market that does not start in the near future. the respondents' intentions to buy digital technologies differ, particularly highlighting a higher percentage of \"no\" in spain. the data is based on 311 cases and is presented on slide 59, attributed to the company \"omnivision digital.\" the image, therefore, showcases detailed data in a clear and concise manner, highlighting the lack of intention to adopt digital technologies in significant portions of the sampled group, with an observable higher percentage of reluctance towards adoption in certain regions. the image contains a bar chart titled \"technology intention to buy\", which inquires about respondents' willingness to start using digital technologies within two years. below the title, there is also a subheading \"are you willing to start using digital technologies within 2 years?\". the bar chart includes a horizontal bar for each country and two vertical bar charts. the vertical bars show respondents' responses (either \"yes\" or \"no\") from a base of 311 cases. the horizontal bars represent

brazil. random sample the image contains a pie chart labeled \"offer of cad-cam prostheses: and how do you do it?\" which provides data about the offer of cad-cam prostheses based on ownership and provision to providers by dentists. the top part of the pie chart depicts that the majority, approximately 94% of dentists offer cad-cam prostheses. the remaining 6% is further divided into two smaller segments, with 5% of the dentists being owners who have scanner and milling units, and 3% of the dentists not owning such devices and instead sending models to a provider. the image also includes a bar graph on the right side illustrating various statistics about the dentists offering cad-cam prostheses. this section is categorized into multiple factors, such as: 1. **number of chairs**: this breaks down the dentists offering cad-cam prostheses into: - 1 chair (7%), - 2 chairs (5%), - 3 or more chairs (9%), - total (3 or more chairs: 52%). 2. **low to high social class**: the social class distribution of the dentists is as follows: - high/upper (2%), - middle-middle class (22%), - middle-low class (57%), - low class (5%), - total (58% in middle-to-lower classes). 3. **monthly expenditures**: this reveals the average monthly expenditure (excluding taxes) on consumable materials: - below 2000 (9%), - 2000 to 2999 (5%), - 3000 to 4999 (9%), - 5000 to 7999 (7%), -

15 patients per week). the overall data depicted both visually in the pie chart and numerically in the bar graph indicate a majority of dentists offering cad-cam prostheses, with the remaining smaller segments providing detailed insights into the specific distribution among different types and sizes of practices. the image contains a bar graph representing the monthly expenditure on consumable materials for cad-cam users. there are two sets of bars, each depicting the percentage of users who fall into a specific expenditure bracket. the first bar measures the percentage of users spending up to 15,000, with a total of 100% of participants falling into this category. the second bar shows the percentage of users spending more than 15,000, with a much smaller distribution, totaling 89% of participants. additionally, there is a color-coding scheme where the first bar is a solid blue and the second bar is divided into segments: a lighter blue representing 11%, and a dark blue representing 6%. this indicates the varying ranges of monthly expenditure among the users. the image contains two bar charts that illustrate the offering of cad-cam prostheses, as represented by owners of cad-cam equipment. each bar chart presents data across three different classifications of dental chairs and social classes of patients. here's a detailed description of each component: *title and header:** the top of both bar charts features the title, \"offer of cad-cam prostheses,\" followed by a subtitle or question, \"and how do you do it?\" indicating a focus on how cad-cam prostheses are offered in medical practices. *legend:** the legend below the graphs categorizes responders into different groups: - **owners (scanner only):** represented by dark blue bars - **owners chairside (scanner and milling unit):** represented by lighter blue bars - **not owner and send the models to a provider:** represented by blue bars *variables and percentages:** 1. **number of dental chairs:** - the left-most column indicates the \"number of dental chairs\" from \"1\" to \"(high/mid/high class).\" - the respective percentage percentages of owners, owner chairside, and those not owning with chairside are listed next to each column: - 1 chair: 100%; 95%; 88% - 2 chairs: 88%; 95%; 98% - 3 or more chairs: 88%; 88%; 88% 2. **social class of patients:** - each subsequent column represents the \"social class of patients.\" - they include \"d (middle)\", \"c/d (middle high class)\", \"middle class\", \"(a/b) class\", and lower class. - the percentages for each class across all groups are as follows: - d class (middle): 88%, 95%, 89% - c/d class (middle high class): 97%, 98%, 97% - middle class: 98%, 98%, 98% - (a/b) class: 100%, 100%, 100% - lower class: 88%, 88%, 88% *bars:** the bars for \"owners (scanner only)\" are usually the tops of each column, making it notable that in most categories, this group consistently represents the top offer percentage. \"owners chairside\" falls right behind them and usually shows a slightly lower but still considerable percentage. the \"not owner and send the models to a provider\" shows the lowest percentage but is relevant in each category. *pie chart (left of graphs):** a pie chart divides \"owners\" by whether they are chairside providers or not, breaking it down into 94% (without chairside) and 5% (with chairside). an intriguing piece of information from this pie chart is that owners who provide chairside service are fewer (5% compared to a substantial 94% who do not use a chairside service). *footer note:** the note, \"considering that only 42% of the sample offers cad-cam prostheses and that 4.7% of these offers include a chairside, it is calculated that there is less than 2% of cad-cam in brazil.\" base information: 239 cases *brand and source:** at the bottom right of the chart, \"key-stone\" is mentioned, likely indicating the source or brand associated with the survey or the publication of the data. this detailed breakdown of the chart reveals how the offerings of cad-cam prostheses are distributed across various group classifications by dental practitioners in brazil. it captures their reliance on ownership, capacity, and patient social status. the image contains two sets of bar graphs accompanied by accompanying texts. one graph displays detailed metrics related to the ownership and usage of cad-cam prostheses by a sample group of 239 cases, and the second bar graph shows demographic data specific to patients who use the cad-cam prostheses. the first bar graph, located on the left side of the page, features a pie chart at the top with three segments. it labels: **94% owners (scanner only)** **5% owners chairside (scanner and milling unit)** **1% not owner and send the models to a provider** below the pie chart, a cluster of seven bars (one for each category) provides specific percentage values: **owners (scanner only)**: 98%, 9%, 5%, 9% (from left to right) **owners chairside (scanner and milling unit)**: 95%, 9% (from left to right) **not owner and send the models to a provider**: 88%, 88% (from left to right) the accompanying text elaborates that only 42% of the sample offers cad-cam prostheses, with only 4.7% offering both the scanner and milling unit, indicating that less than 2% of cad-cam uses are in brazil. the second bar graph on the right side of the page illustrates the correlation between the number of patients serviced per week and the monthly expenditure on consumable materials per dollar spent. the key categories on the horizontal x-axis from left to right are: **number of patients per week**: up to 30, from 31 to 60, more than the key categories on the vertical y-axis (which appears in two parts) are: **monthly expenditure on consumable materials**: per 1 dollar, per $12 (separated into different percentage segments for $1 & $12). every category has blue bars representing different percentages. for details: for `up to 30` patients per week, the bars show percentages of `98%` and `2%` for monthly expenditures of $1 and $12 respectively. for `from 31 to 60` patients per week, the values are `95%` and `2%` for $1, and `5%` and `4%` for $ for `more than 60` patients per week, the figures are `88%` and `5%` for $1, and `12%` and `5%` for $ the data emphasize the higher correlation with the number of patients served, as represented by the length of the bars, especially visible in the cost associated per $ the bottom of both graphs notes that the base sample size used is 239 cases under the label

observations include differences in the number of dental technicians among different countries, and the data reflects that a higher number of technicians may be found in countries like spain and the uk where competition among laboratories is greater. in conclusion, the pie chart is a summary of a survey, showing a significant majority of dental practices have only one or two technicians, with a small proportion having three or more technicians, while a considerable portion lacks detailed data due to unanswered questions. the image shows a series of bar graphs grouped by country, specifically representing data on dental practices. this data has been taken into account by various countries regarding the number of dental technicians and laboratories available. each bar section indicates the percentage for the number of laboratories a dental practitioner is likely to deal with. there are six countries in the image: de (germany), fr (france), it (italy), sp (spain), and uk (united kingdom). for germany (de), there is a total of 100% split across three data points. out of 100 cases: - 64% of cases show a single lab in practice. - 21% showcase two labs. - 15% illustrate more than two, aligning with the average, 2.0, presented in image- in france (fr), a similar distribution is apparent. the data across six sections show: - 27% are associated with one lab. - 43% with two labs. - 28% with more than two labs, close to the mean value of 2.1 displayed in image- for italy (it), the bar graph aligns closely with the previous trends: - 34% show one lab. - 43% show two. - 22% show more than two labs. spain (sp) follows a closely related distribution: - 21% align with one lab. - 42% with two labs. - 37% with more than two labs, with the mean of 2.4 illustrated earlier. the united kingdom (uk): - 24% show one lab. - 22% show two. - 22% depict more than two lab involvement. the visual structure is designed to provide a simplified understanding of how many laboratories most dentists work with across different european countries. each country's data aligns with or diverges slightly from the mean values depicted in the pie charts and other visual data provided in the first image. for instance, each bar graph consistently shows a higher percentage of dentists with at least one lab in practice, but variances appear in the distribution across single and multiple laboratories. the image contains three bar charts stacked vertically to the right side and above one another. each bar chart displays data related to the number of dental technicians and laboratories within various countries. the first bar chart at the top shows that germany has the highest number of laboratories with 53%, followed by the united kingdom with 37%, and france with 22%. these charts are marked with numerical values indicating the percentage of laboratories within different countries. the second bar chart shows data for the number of dental technicians. germany also has the highest percentage with 64%, followed closely by the uk with 24%, while france and spain each have 22% and 21% respectively. the third bar chart appears to be a combination of laboratory presence and technician presence, showing more countries. germany tops this combined list with 64% for laboratories and 35% for technicians, the uk has 24% for technicians and 22% for laboratories, with france showing 22% for technicians and 21% for laboratories and spain with 21% for laboratories and 41% for technicians. this section of the image indicates information from a larger infographic survey concerning the number of dental technicians and laboratories. the charts help visualize competitive aspects within different european nations concerning these resources in dental clinics or services. the combined analysis shows that germany overall leads significantly in both laboratory and technician numbers, which is reflective of a larger and more developed dental infrastructure within this country, a point further corroborated by the note mentioning higher competition and a potentially more advanced dental service market in this nation and perhaps other similar industrial countries like the uk and spain.", "n\u00famero de prot\u00e9sicos/laboratorios en las cl\u00ednicas \u00bfhay al menos un prot\u00e9sico trabajando en su cl\u00ednica? 11 en caso afirmativo, \u00bfcu\u00e1ntos?

organization responsible for the data. the chart is titled \"do you have at least a technician at your practice?\" the pie chart clearly displays two segments. the larger segment, in blue, constitutes 92% and is labeled \"no, we cooperate with an external laboratory.\" this indicates that the majority of respondents, 92% of dental professionals, do not have a technician at their practice but instead work with an external laboratory. in comparison, the smaller segment of the pie chart, in dark orange, constitutes 8% and is labeled \"yes.\" this segment shows that 8% of dental professionals have a technician working directly at their practice. adjacent to the pie chart, on the left side of the image, there is additional information indicating that 259 dental practices had no technician and 22 dental practices had a technician, with the remaining practices cooperating with an external laboratory (as explicitly stated by 92%). above the pie chart, there is text that summarizes: \"there is no significant change in comparison to year 2015 (9% of surgeries stating to have at least one technician).\" this suggests that the distribution of having a technician at the time of this survey is quite similar to the situation in 2015, with a slight overall decrease, though largely staying consistent. on the right side of the pie chart, the image also includes a pie chart titled \"if yes, how many?\" where 86% of respondents have 1 technician, 14% have 2 or more technicians, with a noted mean of \"1.2 dental technicians.\" the text clarifies that if the response was 'no,' then the additional question is how many external laboratories do they cooperate with, showing a mean of \"2.2 external laboratories (vs. 2.0 in 2015).\" there are four different bars corresponding to the number of external laboratories: 1 lab (31%), 2 labs (37%), 3+ labs (32%), and dont know/no answer (11%). thus, the pie chart emphasizes that although a technician is present in only 8% of dental practices, there is significant external laboratory collaboration, predominantly involving 2 or more laboratories. the image contains a pie chart divided into two sections, with one large segment in dark blue and a smaller segment in light blue. the dark blue portion of the pie chart is labeled with \"86%\" and the light blue portion with \"14%.\" the image is titled \"number of dental

suggests that the percentage 86% corresponds to practices that have no technicians and instead rely on external laboratories. in alignment, the light blue 14% indicates practices that have at least one dental technician within the surveyed settings. the image contains a pie chart titled \"number of dental technicians and laboratories.\" the pie chart is divided into four distinct segments, each representing a different aspect of healthcare facility surveys: 1. **first segment (dark blue)**: - percentage: 31% - text: \"if not, how many laboratories do you cooperate with?\" - this segment illustrates the proportion of respondents who do not have at least one dental technician at their practice, and then proceed to discuss the number of laboratories they cooperate with in external networks. 2. **second segment (light blue)**: - percentage: 37% - text: \"mean: 2.2 external laboratories (vs. 2.0 in 2015)\" - this segment indicates that 37% of the respondents cooperate with external laboratories, and the mean number of external laboratories used is 2.2, which is an increase from the previous year's data of 2.0. 3. **third segment (dark blue)**: - percentage: 32% - text: \"if yes, how many?\" - this segment captures the respondents who answer 'yes' to having at least one dental technician, and it then details the number of dental technicians they employ. 4. **fourth segment (blue)**: - percentage: 14% - text: \"mean: 1.2 dental technicians\" - this segment informs us that 14% of respondents use more than a few dental technicians, with a mean of 1.2 dental technicians per practice that employs one. the overall message conveyed by the pie chart is to illustrate the distribution of dental technicians and laboratories among surveyed respondents, emphasizing both internal and external cooperation aspects. the second image presents a pie chart related to the number of external laboratories with which dental practices in the given study collaborate. this chart specifically addresses the 259 cases surveyed in the study, detailing the distribution of external laboratories these practices partner with. the data is segmented into categories concerning the number of external laboratories: 1 external laboratory 2 or more external laboratories the pie chart is color-coded for ease of understanding, featuring: **dark blue** for practices collaborating with only one external laboratory (32%). **light blue** for practices collaborating with two or more external laboratories (31%). furthermore, the mean number of external laboratories (noted as 2.2 in the studys 2015 data comparison) provides a reference for the distribution observed. also included in the chart is an additional color-coding key at the bottom: **dark blue** represents 1 external laboratory. **light blue** indicates 2 or more external laboratories. **unknown / no answer** with a corresponding gray segment. the chart's key clearly differentiates the collaborated laboratory types, illustrating the preference or requirement for multiple collaborations. in summary, this pie chart provides a visual representation of the external laboratory collaboration practices among dental surgical services, reflecting an increase in partnerships in 2015 as compared to previous years. the distribution highlights a significant portion of practices

not inclined to purchase a 3d printing unit within the next two years. this data is part of a larger infographic that also includes additional information, such as feedback on purchasing and technological preferences. ### chart breakdown: **title and question:** the chart is titled \"are you willing to purchase a 3d printing unit within 2 years?\" which is followed by an addendum for non-owners, with a primary focus on their responses. **visual representation:** the data is visualized using a bar graph with two sets of reasons, based on different sample groups. each category contains a list of potential reasons, each represented by a horizontal bar's length corresponding to the proportion of respondents who selected that reason. the lengths of the bars are directly proportional to the percentage of respondents choosing each reason. ### specific chart analysis: **reasons:** these reasons are categorized with both horizontal bars and explanatory line under them. the horizontal bars are colored grey and depict the selected reasons by respondents. **categories:** the responses within the non-owner segment are divided into: - **too expensive**: 22% - **i don't need it**: 19% - **i prefer the traditional method**: 12% - **i'm retiring**: 11% - **low demand**: 9% - **poor system precision**: 6% - **not interested**: 6% - **i have other priorities**: 6% - **poor familiarity with the technology**: 2% - **don't know / no answer**: 8% ### contextual information: the infographic notes that the \"price issue\" has a lesser relevance for non-owners, though it is highlighted still. the infographic indicates that the preference for traditional methods comes third, emphasizing more on the perceived shortcomings in system accuracy and the demand for 3d printing, implying that these factors might be more influential to non-owners than the cost. the textual analysis underscores the point that traditional milling or printing processes might be more commonly used, especially for those who are not familiar with the technology. ### additional element: **survey bases:** the data sets are also noted: the top graph is based on 279 cases, while the bottom one, potentially representing both the owner and non-owner combined, is based on 243 cases, which may give insight into whether the distribution of reasons differs across owner and non-owner subgroups. ### conclusion: while the price is a significant reason for non-owners, it does not necessarily dominate the considerations most non-owners have. instead, concerns around the necessity of the purchase, comfort with traditional methods, and familiarity with technology appear to play a more crucial role. the graph also suggests that for many, the perceived value and utility of traditional methods continue to have a strong influence.", "technology intention to buy: overall are you willing to purchase an intra-oral scanner, a chairside cad-cam milling unit or a 3d printing
