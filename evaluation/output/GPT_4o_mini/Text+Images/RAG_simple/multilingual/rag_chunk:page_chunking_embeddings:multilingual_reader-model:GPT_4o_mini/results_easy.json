frequency of doctors' approaches about the digitization process across different cases per doctor. the segments are categorized as \"never,\" \"seldom,\" and \"often,\" with specific percentages for each category. the largest segment, consisting of 51% of the pie chart, is labeled \"never.\" this indicates that over half of the doctors surveyed do not approach digitization. the second-largest segment, representing 37% of the chart, is labeled \"seldom.\" this suggests that a substantial but slightly smaller segment of doctors approach digitization sparingly. the smallest segment, taking up 12% of the pie chart, is marked \"often.\" this indicates that a smaller percentage of doctors frequently employs digitization methods. this pie chart is visually separated from the rest of the first image, positioned at the bottom. the segmentation of responses (never, seldom, often) directly correlates with the data presented above, indicating the distribution of doctor's approaches to digitalization processes. the other parts of the first image provide additional context and comparative data points, such as the comparison of frequency across different countries in europe, the reasons for not recommending digitization, and correlations between laboratory size and preference for digitization. these elements complement the quantitative insights provided by the pie chart. the image contains a bar chart that presents the frequency of approaches to dentists about digitalization undertaken by doctors in different european countries. it accompanies a more detailed infographic in the main image to provide insight into the attitudes and behaviors of dental laboratories (labs) responding to dental digitalization. the bar chart specifically focuses on three factors: the percentage of doctors who do not consider themselves digitization experts, the percentage who note a lack of time for this activity, the percentage lacking necessary tools\/materials to aid in this process, and the percentage of smaller labs versus larger labs. these categories are color-coded: light blue for smaller labs and dark blue for larger labs. for germany, 11% of doctors do not consider themselves digitalization experts, 57% of smaller labs and 32% of larger labs have these concerns, suggesting a high need for improvement or professional development. in france, 9% of doctors consider themselves non-experts and both the percentages for smaller labs and larger labs (59% and 32% respectively) remain relatively high, indicating a significant need for training and support in digitalization practices. italy shows 12% of doctors not considering themselves digitization experts, with smaller labs at 41% and larger labs at 47%, pointing to a significant gap in digital skills. for spain, the data suggests only 9% of doctors are non-experts, but smaller labs report 67% lacking the necessary tools\/materials, and larger labs report 25%. in the uk, 13% of doctors claim they are not digitization experts, with smaller labs showing this concern even higher at 60%, while larger labs report 28%. the overall message conveyed by this chart is that there is a high need for digital skills training in dentistry across all countries but that smaller labs tend to face more immediate challenges due to resource constraints. the image contains a bar chart with the title \"i do not consider myself a digitization expert, do not feel i am in the position to advise,\" followed by four horizontal bars. the percentages and associated reasons for not considering oneself an expert

4. **innovation:** slightly less important than the broad range of procedures, it accounts for 15%. 5. **production increase:** with a 12% share, pointing to efficiency improvements. 6. **reputation of the brand:** important to some, with 5% of the responses. 7. **convenience:** also rated as important but not as prevalent, at 5%. 8. **flexibility:** rated a bit lower, at 4%. 9. **quality of the restorations (noted separately):** a duplicated reason with only 2% significance. 10. **demand from dentists:** a minor fraction, noted at only 1%. 11. **other:** encompassing miscellaneous reasons at 5%. 12. **don't know:** a minimal 3% of users remain undecisive. additionally, a descriptive note at the end explains that ease of daily practice and the quality of restorations are primary reasons for using digital equipment. it also notes flexibility and convenience as less prominent factors but emphasized by the survey respondents. *in-lab milling:** for in-lab milling, the categories show a similar breakdown, with notable differences: 1. **makes the daily practice easier:** dominates with 39%, suggesting significant ease in daily practice. 2. **quality of the restorations:** holds a substantial 25%. 3. **broad range of procedures:** also important, at 19%. 4. **convenience:** lesser importance, 9%. 5. **innovation and reputation of the brand:** both at 4% each. 6. **flexibility and production increase:** both marginally rate at 4%. 7. **demand from dentists:** minor at 3%. 8. **other:** at 5%. 9. **don't know:** similarly, a small minority at 3%. the second image visually emphasizes these points through a combined pie and bar chart for an easy visual reference, and textual data for a concise summary of each category with their respective percentages. the image contains a bar chart titled \"brand numeric distribution: reasons to use,\" which represents the reasons for using a scanner\/in-lab milling unit based on a sample of 230 cases. the chart shows the proportional distribution of the top reasons listed on the x-axis. the chart is divided into two sections: 1. **scanner**: - **makes the daily practice easier (19%)**: the bar representing this reason has a moderate length, showing that just below half of the respondents valued this aspect. - **quality of the restorations (28%)**: this is the most significant reason according to the chart, as it represents more than a quarter of the total responses. - **broad and range procedures (16%)**: the bar indicates this aspect as the third most emphasized reason among the 230 cases. - **innovation (15%)**: with a relatively similar bar length to \"broad range of procedures,\" this reason is tied for the fourth place. - **other reasons (2%)**: this is the least significant factor in this list, with a very short bar. - **reputation of the brand (5%)**: this shows a slight preference, though it does not stand out among the major reasons. - **convenience (5%)**: once more, it is quite minimal and similar to \"reputation of the brand.\" - **flexibility (4%)**: this is slightly better than \"convenience\" and \"reputation of the brand\" but still minor. - **productivity increase (3%)**: it is the second most minuscule reason. 2. **in-lab milling**: - **makes the daily practice easier (39%)**: this represents a significant increase in value compared to the scanner category, indicating that in-lab milling is particularly valued for simplifying daily practice. - **quality of the restorations (25%)**: this is the second most valued among the respondents, highlighting the importance of restoration quality in in-lab milling. - **broad range of procedures (19%)**: slightly lower than the scanner category, this reason still holds considerable weight. - **flexibility (4%)**: similar to \"innovation\" in the scanner section, but slightly higher in the in-lab milling context. - **convenience (9%)**: a notable increase over the scanner, again suggesting in-lab milling's superiority here. - **innovation (4%)**: remains consistent with scanner, indicating modest importance. - **reputation of the brand (4%)**: the same as \"innovation\" and \"flexibility.\" - **productivity increase (3%)**: again, similar to \"productivity increase\" in the scanner comparison. - the **other** category is 3%. a notable observation is that the perception of using a scanner\/in-lab milling unit varies significantly between the two contexts. for scanners, ease of daily practice is the most common reason, whereas for in-lab milling, ease and functionality dominate. on the right-hand side of the chart, there is a summary sentence \"daily practice made easier and quality of the restorations are the main reasons quoted by the digital equipment users. to a lesser extent, flexibility in terms of a broader range of procedures available and the convenience are also felt to be important.\" this aligns the visual data by emphasizing the pivotal role of ease of use and quality."],"10":["caracter\u00edsticas requeridas a los proveedores de tecnolog\u00edas \u00bfqu\u00e9 deber\u00eda ofrecerle su proveedor de tecnolog\u00eda digital para mejorar el modo en que

characteristics valued by both \"clinicas\" (clinics) and \"laboratorios\" (labs) in terms of digital technology providers' offerings. the data is presented in two categories: \"clinica + labo\" combines the values of both clinics and labs, and \"laboratorio\" specifically shows lab values. the graph is color-coded with brown representing values from 2018 and yellow representing values from key features of the bar graph include: 1. **orientation**: the x-axis represents various characteristics deemed important, such as \"formaci\u00f3n, informaci\u00f3n, prueba productos, simplificaci\u00f3n\" (training, information, product testing, simplification), \"precios convenientes\" (convenient prices), \"nada, no estoy interesado\" (i don't care for anything), \"mejorar las relaciones\" (improving relationships), \"mejorar las\u6027\u80fdes\" (improving performance), and \"otro\" (other). the y-axis shows the percentage of respondent values with varying heights indicating the importance given to each characteristic. 2. **comparative data analysis**: - **formaci\u00f3n, informaci\u00f3n, prueba productos, simplificaci\u00f3n**: the most critical aspect for both clinica and lab data in 2018 is training, information, product testing, and simplification, with 53% and 43% for \"clinica + labo\" and \"laboratorio\" respectively. this demonstrates that the demand for information and product integration remains high. by 2015, this factor retained significant importance with 38% and 39% respectively. - **precios convenientes**: convenient pricing holds a significant second position for clinics (40% for clinics in 2018, 22% for laboratories), indicating affordability is a major factor for customers in both categories. in 2015, this value was 40% for clinics and 39% for labs. - **nada, no estoy interesado**: it shows a lower interest level over time. for \"clinica + labo,\" it decreased from 2015 to 2018 (15% to 7%), and for laboratories, from 17% to 7%. - **mejorar las relaciones** (improving relationships) and **mejorar las performancees** (improving performance): only 6% and 4% of clinics preferred these aspects by 2018, lower than previous trends of 6% and 8% in labs saw a minor drop, from 3% to 2% and 2% to 0%. - **otro**: remains a minor yet notable aspect, with 5% for \"clinica + labo\" and 7% for labs in 2018. *insights**: overall, the graph highlights that the integration and streamlined processes of digital solutions, combined with convenient pricing, are significant for both clinics and laboratories, with less emphasis on specific personal relationships or less defined enhancements. this data could be crucial for technology vendors to tailor their offerings based on these observed trends. the image contains a bar graph that compares the characteristics preferred by providers of medical laboratories in the years 2015 and 2018 regarding the use of digital technology. the graph is divided into two sections: one for clinics and another for clinic + lab, indicating a breakdown by type of facility. each section includes features rated by the providers and their corresponding percentage from the years 2015 and the background of the bars alternates between yellow for 2015 and brown for 2018 to visually differentiate the data from each year. 1. **clinics** - **formaci\u00f3n e informaci\u00f3n (training and

longest bar indicates that by 2018, a notable 26% of laboratory professionals did not see any value in digital technologies for their needs. ### comparative analysis: **dental practices**: there is a clear focus on training and information for both years, indicating a consistent importance in providing users with updated and comprehensive educational resources. significant changes are seen in the percentage of those interested in price convenience, showing a stronger focus on affordability and ease of use in 2018. **laboratories**: a substantial increase is seen in those requiring training and information (48% in 2018 compared to 25% in 2015), indicating a more significant shift towards valuing educational resources. the lack of interest among lab professionals almost doubled from 14% in 2015 to 26% in 2018, possibly reflecting skepticism or a higher degree of self-sufficiency in the lab sector. the overall pattern and trends identified from these data highlight a significant rise in the perceived value of training and affordability in 2018 compared to 2015, likely driven by advancements and enhanced digital offerings. the image contains a horizontal bar graph comparing the most required features from digital technology providers by dental practitioners and laboratories in three different categories: \"dental practices,\" \"laboratories,\" and a combined category titled \"clinic + labo.\" for \"dental practices,\" the features in descending order of importance are: 1. **price convenience**: 42% (represented by a dark brown bar) 2. **training, information,

oriented (ranked 23% with 3.5 mean) - good price quality ratio (ranked 21% with 3.2 mean) - affordable (ranked 8% with 2.9 mean) on the left side, the list of brand attributes is given without the specific percentages and means associated with them, but it mirrors the list on the upper side. these include: worldwide reknown highly reputable innovative and at the forefront leading company reliable recommendable to colleagues trustworthy too expensive makes daily practice easier customer service oriented good price quality ratio affordable the image then explains that there are five possible answers that have been further clustered for better score highlighting among the evaluated brands. these clusters are not relevant, partially relevant, neutral, quite relevant, and totally relevant. the paragraph on the bottom left describes the reason for the clustering and briefly mentions the total relevance of the factors. finally, the overall data indicates that attributes like being \"worldwide reknown\" and \"highly reputable\" are highly significant, with higher mean scores, suggesting that these factors are particularly important to the respondents' perception of overall brand quality.","required features from digital technology providers what should your digital technology provider offer you, to improve and enhance the way you perform restorations and prosthetics in

**2018:** 43% - **2015:** 38% the chart shows that training and information related to digital technology have a very high percentage, reflecting an increased importance year over year. 2. **price convenience:** - **2018:** 22% - **2015:** 35% the need for price convenience was also a concern, although the preference dropped from 35% in 2015 to 22% in 2018, suggesting a minor but significant decline. 3. **not interested:** - **2018:** 18% - **2015:** 16% a slight number of users were not interested in digital technology, with a slight increase in this segment's preference being observed. 4. **improve performances:** - **2018:** 10% - **2015:** 5% improving performance was another significant need, with its percentage more than doubling from 5% in 2015 to 10% in 2018. 5. **innovation:** - **2018:** 4% - **2015:** 1% innovation, while important, has seen a small increase in preference, from 1% to 4%. 6. **customer service:** - **2018:** 2% - **2015:** 1% customer service has seen a minor increase in preference in terms of importance, increasing slightly from 1% in 2015 to 2% in 2018. 7. **don't know \/ no answer:** - **2018:** 11% - **2015:** 14% a smaller number of respondents were unsure in 2018 compared to the 14% who were uncertain in 2015, indicating a decrease in this category. *supporting text:** the graphic notes a comparison between the years 2018 and it states training and information features have increased significantly over the years. the importance of a convenient price remains high but less so compared to the importance of performance gains respect to the past. *logos and identification:** the bottom right of the chart features the logo of key-stone, a company or entity presumably associated with the survey or the presentation. the upper left corner includes the digital intelligence (di) logo. *overall impression:** the data highlights the significant importance of digitally informed training for improving laboratory performance in prosthetics over the given years. the decline in the need for convenience pricing is notable. innovations and customer service improvements have seen modest increases.

said that the relative scores quoted by both samples are rather consistent, showing almost the same behavior. both samples gave lower than average scores for the item too expensive, good price\/quality ratio and affordable, while the performance of other items related to the brand reputation and reliability received higher scores. when considering the brands individually, in the clinical market, while sirona is rather on average, its interesting to note that kavo performed better than the competitors with regard to affordability and customer service oriented, while 3m is more than other brands associated with too expensive and worldwide renowned. on the technical side, it is worth to mention bego, which is higher than average in trustworthy, but far below for too expensive, and sirona, whose performance on affordability and customer service oriented, is not on par with the other brands. zirkonzahn showed higher scores for recommendation and innovation, while amann girrbach is higher than average in good price quality ratio. the image contains two parts of a chart, titled \"brand positioning, items average scores - europe\". the chart compares the perception of dental practices and laboratories regarding various attributes. for \"dental practices\": the chart lists attributes such as \"recommendable to colleagues,\" \"innovative and at the forefront,\" \"customer service oriented,\" \"affordable,\" \"trustworthy,\" \"too expensive,\" \"highly reputable,\" \"reliable,\" \"makes daily practice easier,\" \"good price quality ratio,\" \"worldwide renowned,\" and \"leading company.\" each attribute has three sections colored in varying shades of blue and navy blue, representing not relevant, quite relevant, and totally relevant. the

\"laboratories\": the same list of attributes is repeated under \"laboratories,\" also accompanied by the categories of not relevant, quite relevant, and totally relevant. again, each attribute is depicted with corresponding percentages to illustrate how significant these attributes are from a laboratory's perspective. the scores for each category on the y-axis, presumably in different shades for distinguishing average to high, are visible for both dental practices and laboratories. the colors further depict how each attribute is correlated with perceptions or needs.","key-stone omnivision

processing. both factor analyses worked at their best when the output consisted in two factors, whose meaning and names have been the same for both groups. the first factor was nearness and the second one was reputation. even though the driving items are not exactly the same, both analysis may have the same meaning: nearness is the factor driven by items clearly related to the close relationship that a company may show, like customer service, affordability, reliability, while the second factor named reputation is made up of items in close relation to the image and reputation of a brand. chart brand positioning, factor analysis map - europe despite the factor analysis showed the same factors for both groups, the positioning maps had rather different results. the map of the dental practices sample was clearly influenced by the high weight of sirona in the analysis, whose position was in the middle of the map. a bit more scattered the map of the sample made up of dental laboratories. in the analysis on the laboratories, sirona has no central position and its brand image looks not to be related neither to the nearness, nor to the reputation. kavo brand image looks to be almost the same in both analysis, that is, more linked to the nearness and on average with regard to the reputation. other relevant topics worth to be mentioned are the position of dentsply in the analysis on the dental practices, very much related to the nearness, and the position of ivoclar vivadent in the analysis on the laboratories, which seems to be highly related to the reputation, just like zirkonzahn and, to a lesser extent, 3shape. the image contains a 2x2 matrix that categorizes the relationship between dental practices and laboratories in terms of \"repuation\" (left y-axis) and
