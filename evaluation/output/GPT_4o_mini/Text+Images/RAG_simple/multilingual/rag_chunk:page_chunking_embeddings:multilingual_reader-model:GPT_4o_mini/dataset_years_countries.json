both france (purple) and spain (pink) show consistent high usage over the points marked, with scores hovering close to 4. - italy (blue) starts with a lower score but increases incrementally but without as significant a peak. 2. **improving internal planning activities, orthodontic, surgical, and/or implant prosthesis:** - france and spain continue to rate the scanner favorably, with scores staying around 4. - italys score is slightly lower than the previous category but shows improvement with a peak closer to the earlier range but still not fully as high. 3. **communication tool with the patient:** - france maintains high scores, close to 4. - spain sees a significant rise after the initial point from around 3 to nearing 4. - italy initially has a score around 3, gradually increasing but stays below the other countries in this category. 4. **marketing tool that improves the practice:** - france continues high usage, similar to the previous categories. - spain starts lower but then reaches the highest scores, showing the scanner's notable utility here. - italy mirrors its performance from prior categories, staying around mid-range. ### analysis: france maintains a consistent, high level of perceived usefulness across all categories, showing it as a favored tool for multiple aspects of dental practice. spain shows a significant increase in usefulness over time for certain categories, indicating it may have greater adoption or increased awareness of the scanners applications. italy, while improving, remains relatively lower across all categories, suggesting either slower adoption or the scanners utility being felt more in specific areas as opposed to across-the-board effectiveness. overall, the graph visualizes the comparison between these three european countries, highlighting the versatility and perceived benefits of the intraoral scanner in different areas of dental and orthodontic practices. the image contains a chart illustrating the perceived usefulness of an intraoral scanner across various dental practice scenarios based on the feedback of dentists in four different countries: france, italy, spain, and an aggregate of the surveyed dentists' responses. the survey sample size is 371 respondents in total. the chart is partitioned into five rows, corresponding to different applications and purposes of the scanner: 1. **tool for optimizing times (from chairside operations to laboratory work):** - encompassing france (24%), italy (50%), spain (18%), andmean votefrom3.6to4.0. 2. **tool for improving clinical effectiveness, accuracy, and predictability of treatments:** - including france (18%), italy (24%), spain (50%),mean votefrom3.3to4.0. 3. **tool for improving internal planning activities, orthodontic, surgical, and/or implant prosthetics:** -

this response indicates a belief that despite technological advancements, the fundamental roles of individuals in the field will remain unchanged due to inherent differences in expertise and responsibilities. 2. **the cooperation between dentists and technicians will increase because the knowledge of the technician in prosthetics materials, esthetics and digital processing are important** - this option suggests that the integration between dentists and technicians will grow, primarily driven by an appreciation and necessity for the specialized knowledge that technicians possess, especially in the areas of prosthetics materials, esthetics, and digital processing. 3. **the dentists will need to get more expertise about prosthetics**, because they will be required to perform part of the work in charge of technicians this answer implies a shift towards dentists needing to possess more expertise in prosthetics themselves, possibly reflecting a trend toward dentists taking over more duties traditionally handled by technicians. 4. **dont know** - this response signifies uncertainty or a lack of clear understanding about how roles might change or evolve with new digital technologies in the dental profession. these responses collectively represent a spectrum of viewpoints ranging from resistant to change (believing that individual roles will remain distinct) to an anticipation of increased collaboration and broader skill sets. this context, when aligned with the accompanying pie chart and additional data from the first image, offers a comprehensive view into the diverse perceptions and expectations regarding the impact of new digital technologies on the roles of dentists and technicians."

across different european countries. the image displays a textual enumeration of survey responses, specifically focusing on the expected changes in relationships between dentists, technicians, and the industry in response to the introduction of new digital technologies. the primary question asks: \"how do you think the relationship between dentists and technicians and the industry will change with the new digital technologies?\" below the question, there are four primary categories for responses, each represented by a different colored dot: 1. **blue dot**: indicates respondents who believe the relationship will become tighter primarily due to the high specialization of technicians on prosthetics and cad (computer-aided design) processing. 2. **gray dot**: represents respondents who think the relationship will become blander because cad processing will become even easier and not require specific expertise from dentists. 3. **red dot**: depicts respondents who anticipate the industry relationship will become tighter due to the increased need for specific manufactured products and services. 4. **light blue dot**: represents respondents who chose 'dont know' and left the category blank or did not select this option in favor of the above categories. the corresponding responses from this list appear to be organized by country, though the full context isnt explicitly provided. its likely that each country's data is categorized by place or respondent type, which is a common format for international surveys to allow for comparative analyses. the overall layout is concise and informative, aiming to present the varied responses clearly and quickly while ensuring the data is visually accessible. the inclusion of 'don't know' adds a layer of uncertainty to the analysis, which is valuable for any interpretation of public opinion and industry trends."

both france (purple) and spain (pink) show consistent high usage over the points marked, with scores hovering close to 4. - italy (blue) starts with a lower score but increases incrementally but without as significant a peak. 2. **improving internal planning activities, orthodontic, surgical, and/or implant prosthesis:** - france and spain continue to rate the scanner favorably, with scores staying around 4. - italys score is slightly lower than the previous category but shows improvement with a peak closer to the earlier range but still not fully as high. 3. **communication tool with the patient:** - france maintains high scores, close to 4. - spain sees a significant rise after the initial point from around 3 to nearing 4. - italy initially has a score around 3, gradually increasing but stays below the other countries in this category. 4. **marketing tool that improves the practice:** - france continues high usage, similar to the previous categories. - spain starts lower but then reaches the highest scores, showing the scanner's notable utility here. - italy mirrors its performance from prior categories, staying around mid-range. ### analysis: france maintains a consistent, high level of perceived usefulness across all categories, showing it as a favored tool for multiple aspects of dental practice. spain shows a significant increase in usefulness over time for certain categories, indicating it may have greater adoption or increased awareness of the scanners applications. italy, while improving, remains relatively lower across all categories, suggesting either slower adoption or the scanners utility being felt more in specific areas as opposed to across-the-board effectiveness. overall, the graph visualizes the comparison between these three european countries, highlighting the versatility and perceived benefits of the intraoral scanner in different areas of dental and orthodontic practices. the image contains a chart illustrating the perceived usefulness of an intraoral scanner across various dental practice scenarios based on the feedback of dentists in four different countries: france, italy, spain, and an aggregate of the surveyed dentists' responses. the survey sample size is 371 respondents in total. the chart is partitioned into five rows, corresponding to different applications and purposes of the scanner: 1. **tool for optimizing times (from chairside operations to laboratory work):** - encompassing france (24%), italy (50%), spain (18%), andmean votefrom3.6to4.0. 2. **tool for improving clinical effectiveness, accuracy, and predictability of treatments:** - including france (18%), italy (24%), spain (50%),mean votefrom3.3to4.0. 3. **tool for improving internal planning activities, orthodontic, surgical, and/or implant prosthetics:** - with responses from france (15%), italy (24%), spain (51%),mean votefrom2.9to4.0. 4. **communication tool with the patient for improving compliance and relationship even after treatment:** - including france (14%), italy (46%), spain (30%),mean votefrom3.3to4.0. 5. **marketing tool that improves the practice:** - encompassing france (13%), italy (45%), spain (31%),mean votefrom3.3to3. each application category is further broken down into five response tiers, each represented by a bar that corresponds to each country's feedback, with the following color codes indicating each tier: indispensable (green) very useful (light green) quite useful (yellow) not very useful (red) useless (dark pink) additionally, the image utilizes a secondary bar graph that visually depicts the mean voting score (from 1 to 5) for each application across the four countries. this graph aids in quickly grasping the aggregated perception levels. a key observation is the general high level of perceived usefulness for the scanner, with nearly all applications garnering substantial percentages of \"indispensable\" and \"very useful\" feedback. the chart effectively communicates the utility of the scanner across different professional and practice-oriented perspectives.",
