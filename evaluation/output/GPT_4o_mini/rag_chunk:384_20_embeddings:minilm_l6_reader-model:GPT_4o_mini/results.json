These brands follow Sirona at a significant distance, indicating they are notable players in the industry. However, Sirona currently maintains undisputed leadership in the milling unit segment.","2":"The brand with the highest ratio between total digital awareness and unaided awareness is 3shape. Although it does not have the highest total awareness value, it leads in this specific ratio. This suggests that 3shape is highly recognized in the digital segment relative to its overall unaided awareness.","3":"In Spain, 20% of indirect restorations are produced with a digital workflow. Traditional techniques account for the remaining 80%. The use of digital technologies is growing, but traditional methods still dominate.","4":"The mean satisfaction score for all CAD-CAM brands in dental labs is approximately 7.5. This score represents an average based on various evaluations across different brands. Specific brands may vary, but this figure gives a general sense of satisfaction among users.","5":"The net promoter score in Italy in 2018 was reported to be -6%.

Approximately 30% of dental labs report being approached at least monthly, and this frequency tends to increase with the lab's size and level of digitization. Overall, Spain shows a higher-than-average frequency of approaches compared to other countries.","7":"The main reason dental professionals are reluctant to purchase an intra-oral scanner within two years is primarily due to the high cost associated with the technology. Additionally, some professionals feel a lack of need for such equipment, often preferring traditional methods instead. Concerns about the return on investment also contribute to their hesitance.","8":"The leading brand of 3D printing units in Spain is Formlabs, which has a significant market penetration. Anycubic follows as the second most popular brand. The use of these printers is primarily focused on applications such as surgical guides and temporary dental elements.","9":"The most recommended iOS brand in dental labs in Europe is 3Shape, particularly noted for its high frequency of recommendation.

However, it mentions that on average, digital prosthesis providers produce about 3.3 indirect restorations per week. This suggests that the total could vary significantly based on the number of providers and their operational scales.","12":"The lowest weight on overall satisfaction for 3Shape is associated with items related to technical assistance, company availability, and start-up training. These areas received lower satisfaction rates compared to others. Overall, while many items contribute positively, these specific factors are identified as weaker points.","13":"Less than 2% of cad-cam users in Brazil have a chairside unit.
