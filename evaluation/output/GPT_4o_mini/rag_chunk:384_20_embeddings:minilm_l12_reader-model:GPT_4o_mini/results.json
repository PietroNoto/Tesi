Additionally, users value the flexibility that comes with a broader range of procedures available and the convenience it offers. These factors contribute significantly to the adoption of in-lab milling technology.","21":"In Italy, 18.5% of production is made by partner laboratories for dentists.","22":"The penetration of dental scanners in the sample of dental laboratories is reported to be 84%. Among these, 55% of the laboratories use scanners for sending scan files externally, while others utilize them with in-lab milling centers. The leading brands in this space include 3shape, Zirkonzahn, and Amann Girrbach.","23":"48% of partner lab users also send their models or scan files to a manufacturer\/milling center. Additionally, 11% of them also have in-lab milling capabilities.","24":"The percentage of elements made with optical impressions in Italy is approximately 62.9%. This indicates a significant reliance on optical impressions compared to traditional methods. Traditional impression materials are still widely used, but optical methods are gaining traction.","25":"Bego has a very good reputation, particularly in Germany, receiving high average scores for reliability, trustworthiness, and innovation. However, it is perceived as somewhat expensive, which affects its price-related perception. Overall, the brand is well-regarded in terms of reputation despite some concerns about pricing.","26":"On average, laboratories produce approximately 7.9 composite elements for fixed prosthesis each week. This figure represents a slight increase compared to previous years. The production methods include both traditional techniques and CAD-CAM technology.","27":"The percentage of elements made with optical impressions that are produced in-house in Italy is 51.3%."},"reference":{"0":"3Shape is the most used intraoral scanner brand.","1":"Imes-Icore","2":"Dentsply Sirona","3":"37.2%","4":"The mean satisfaction score for all CAD-CAM brands in dental labs is 8,1.","5":"The net promoter score in 2018 is 31% for dental clinics and 38% for dental laboratories.","6":"30% of Spanish dental labs are approached at least monthly by doctors about their recommendation on intra-oral scanners.","7":"The main reason why dental professionals are not willing to purchase an intra-oral scanner within 2 years is the price, followed by the lack of need and the preference for the traditional method.","8":"Formlabs","9":"3shape","10":"Dentsply Sirona","11":"47,7% of restorations are produced by digital flow prosthesis providers: crowns, bridges, inlays and veneers, while 52,3% are traditional prosthesis.","12":"The lowest weight on overall satisfaction for 3Shape is the cost areas.","13":"Less than 2%","14":"The brand of the most common in-house CAD\/CAM milling unit is Dentsply Sirona and the average year of purchase is 2016.","15":"France","16":"France","17":"68%","18":"The penetration of dental scanners in the sample of dental laboratories is 84%.","19":"20-30%","20":"The main reasons for digital equipment users in Germany to use their in-lab milling scanner and base are that it makes daily practice easier and improves the quality of the restorations.","21":"18.5%","22":"The penetration of dental scanners in the sample of dental laboratories is 84%.","23":"10-15%","24":"16%","25":"The brand Bego scores higher than average in trustworthiness but falls down below the average in affordability.","26":"Laboratories produces 7.9 composite elements for fixed prosthesis on average in a week.","27":"The context does not provide an explicit answer to this question."},"context_precision":{"0":0.5833333333,"1":0.0,"2":0.25,"3":0.8333333333,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":0.9999999999,"7":1.0,"8":1.0,"9":0.6388888889,"10":0.4166666666,"11":0.5,"12":0.3333333333,"13":0.9999999999,"14":0.25,"15":0.25,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":0.8333333333,"19":0.9999999999,"20":0.5,"21":0.9999999999,"22":1.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.5,"26":0.8333333333,"27":0.0},"faithfulness":{"0":0.375,"1":0.75,"2":0.5,"3":0.25,"4":1.0,"5":0.3333333333,"6":0.2,"7":0.8333333333,"8":0.3333333333,"9":0.8333333333,"10":0.75,"11":1.0,"12":0.5,"13":0.6666666667,"14":1.0,"15":0.0,"16":1.0,"17":1.0,"18":0.6,"19":0.25,"20":0.4,"21":0.0,"22":0.6666666667,"23":1.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":1.0,"27":0.0},"answer_relevancy":{"0":0.9931932167,"1":0.8826803573,"2":0.9859597576,"3":0.9851613116,"4":0.0,"5":0.8600531623,"6":0.9886288953,"7":0.9611134246,"8":0.9208369073,"9":0.7894495941,"10":0.9891215924,"11":0.0,"12":0.701662329,"13":0.9723997368,"14":0.9283541773,"15":0.9774288865,"16":0.0,"17":0.994532612,"18":0.8691055964,"19":0.935717311,"20":0.9124216576,"21":0.9688112105,"22":0.894871486,"23":0.8810282578,"24":0.9776254464,"25":0.7489794733,"26":0.9877404337,"27":0.9779804818},"context_recall":{"0":1.0,"1":0.0,"2":1.0,"3":1.0,"4":0.0,"5":0.0,"6":1.0,"7":1.0,"8":1.0,"9":1.0,"10":1.0,"11":1.0,"12":0.0,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":0.0,"16":0.0,"17":0.0,"18":1.0,"19":0.0,"20":1.0,"21":1.0,"22":1.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":1.0,"27":1.0},"answer_correctness":{"0":0.3513333296,"1":0.0553475602,"2":0.1629405823,"3":0.083232643,"4":0.4765512762,"5":0.1551596533,"6":0.4011677136,"7":0.7286795534,"8":0.1327252284,"9":0.1342516856,"10":0.1455764987,"11":0.0190037215,"12":0.2057612022,"13":0.0846895987,"14":0.9960777373,"15":0.0500667493,"16":0.0442121312,"17":0.0645437763,"18":0.4406504498,"19":0.0714825112,"20":0.6558693071,"21":0.0938404981,"22":0.4183433032,"23":0.0692781852,"24":0.0713065462,"25":0.4967862794,"26":0.5217311241,"27":0.0198494993}}
