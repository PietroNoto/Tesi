They are mentioned alongside other brands in the context of CAD-CAM technology. Competition in this space is growing, and various companies are positioning themselves to challenge established brands like Sirona.","2":"I don't know.","3":"In Spain, approximately 37.2% of indirect restorations are produced using a digital workflow. This reflects a trend where a significant portion of indirect restorations still relies on traditional techniques. The data indicates a notable difference in perceptions between dentists and dental technicians regarding production methods.","4":"The mean satisfaction score for all CAD-CAM brands in dental labs is 8.1. This reflects an increase from the previous average of 7.8 in 2015. The scores are based on evaluations from 274 cases and 365 quotes.","5":"I don't know.","6":"Spanish dental labs are approached by doctors about their recommendations on intra-oral scanners with a frequency that can range from monthly to daily. Approximately 30% of dental labs report being approached at least monthly, and larger, more digitalized labs tend to receive more inquiries. Spain has a higher-than-average overall frequency of these approaches compared to other countries.","7":"The main reasons dental professionals are hesitant to purchase an intra-oral scanner within the next two years are high costs and a lack of perceived need for the technology. Additionally, many prefer traditional methods over digital alternatives. Concerns about retirement and low demand also contribute to their reluctance.","8":"The leading brand of 3D printing unit in Spain is Formlabs, which has a significant penetration in the market. Anycubic follows as a notable competitor, particularly among smaller labs due to its affordability. Overall, the market is fragmented with various players outside the traditional dental sector.","9":"The most recommended intraoral scanner brand in dental labs in Europe is 3shape, which is particularly popular in Spain and Italy. Itero follows closely behind, especially recommended in the UK. Dentsply Sirona also receives significant recommendations, especially in Italy.","10":"The brand with the highest ratio between spontaneous and total notoriety in the digital equipment segment in Spain is 3shape. It has a notable level of recognition, indicating its strong presence in consumers' minds. Other brands like Dentsply Sirona and Align Technology are also mentioned but do not surpass 3shape's ratio.","11":"The total number of restorations produced by digital flow prosthesis providers is approximately 5.9 indirect restorations per week on average. This figure represents the production across various practices utilizing digital technologies, including full outsourcing. However, the exact cumulative total for all providers is not specified.","12":"The lowest weight on overall satisfaction for 3Shape is associated with start-up training, frequency of software updates, and technical assistance. These items are identified as being in a weaker position regarding their impact on overall satisfaction. Despite this, they still hold a significant weight in the overall satisfaction assessment.","13":"Less than 2% of dental practices in Brazil have a chairside CAD-CAM unit. This indicates that the adoption of chairside technology among CAD-CAM users is quite low.
