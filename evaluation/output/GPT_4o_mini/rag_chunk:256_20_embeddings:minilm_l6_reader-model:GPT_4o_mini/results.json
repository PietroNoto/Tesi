Other notable competitors include Kavo, Ivoclar Vivadent, and 3M. These brands are recognized in the CAD-CAM market and may pose challenges to Sirona's market position.","2":"The brand with the highest ratio between total digital awareness and unaided awareness is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, 3shape is frequently highlighted as a leading brand in awareness. There is no specific data indicating the highest ratio among the brands discussed.","3":"In Spain, 62.8% of indirect restorations are produced using digital workflow. The remaining 37.2% are produced with traditional techniques. These figures reflect a significant reliance on digital technologies in the production of indirect restorations.","4":"The mean satisfaction score for all CAD-CAM brands in dental labs is not explicitly provided in the context. However, various brands such as Dental Wings and 3shape have been mentioned with satisfaction ratings based on user feedback. For a specific mean score, more detailed data would be required.","5":"The net promoter score (NPS) in Italy in 2018 was +2%. This score indicates a low level of customer advocacy, as values above 20 are considered satisfactory. The highest NPS score reported was 13 for the brand Amann Girrbach.","6":"Spanish dental labs are approached by doctors about their recommendations on intra-oral scanners at least monthly, with 30% reporting such frequency. The frequency of these approaches tends to increase with the size and digitization level of the labs. Overall, Spain shows a higher-than-average frequency of approaches compared to other countries.","7":"The main reasons dental professionals are not willing to purchase an intra-oral scanner within the next two years are primarily related to cost and a perceived lack of need for the technology. Many dentists also prefer traditional methods and are considering retirement or a reduction in practice activity. Additionally, there is a concern about low demand for such technologies.","8":"The leading brand of 3D printing unit in Spain is Formlabs, which holds a significant market share. Other brands like DWS and Bego follow behind but do not compare to Formlabs' dominance.","9":"The most recommended iOS brand in dental labs in Europe is 3Shape, particularly popular in Spain and Italy. Itero follows as the top recommendation in the UK. Carestream and Dentsply Sirona also receive significant endorsements across various countries.","10":"The brand with the highest ratio between spontaneous and total notoriety in the digital equipment segment in Spain is 3shape.

In addition, 55% of these laboratories utilize scanners specifically for sending external scan files. This indicates a significant adoption of scanning technology within the laboratory sector.","19":"I don't know.","20":"The main reason for digital equipment users in Germany to use their in-lab milling scanner and base is to produce digital restorations efficiently. Many laboratories utilize their in-lab milling units alongside scanners to create scan files that can be processed either in-house or sent to external manufacturers for milling. This approach enhances the production capabilities and flexibility of dental restorations.","21":"I don't know.","22":"The penetration of dental scanners in the sample of dental laboratories is reported to be 84%. Additionally, 55% of these laboratories use scanners for sending scan files outside or for in-lab milling centers. In contrast, dental practices show a lower penetration, with only 20% using intraoral scanners.","23":"48% of European partner lab users also send their models or scan files to a manufacturer\/milling center. Additionally, 11% of them have in-lab milling.","24":"The percentage of elements made with optical impressions in Italy is approximately 62.9%. This figure reflects the average weight of optical impressions out of the total impressions taken in dental practices. Traditional impression materials continue to be widely used, but optical impressions are gaining traction.","25":"The brand Bego has a high reputation, as indicated by strong averages in reliability and trustworthiness. However, it tends to receive lower scores in terms of affordability and price-quality ratio. Overall, its reputation positively influences recommendations from users.","26":"On average, laboratories produce approximately 7.9 composite elements for fixed prosthesis in a week. This figure has shown some variation over the years, but it remains close to this average.
