72 base: 179 cases (digital prosthesis providers) since practices may use different technologies and channels, the sum of percentages is higher than 100%. since the digital prosthesis providers have almost doubled with respect to 2015, the following chart shows the penetration of the different channels calculated on the whole sample. it is interesting to note how the penetration of the chairside milling units looks to be quite stable over the years, while the most relevant part in the increase in the use of the digital technologies is played by the increase of the outsourcing especially by using the partner lab (outsourcing by using the manufacturer/milling center is quite low). percentage of dental practices - digital users only the differences below +/- 2% should be considered not statistically relevant. percentage of dental practices - whole sample clinic base: 281 cases (whole sample)"], "test_settings": "chunk:page_chunking_embeddings:mpnet_base_v2_reader-model:zephyr-7b-beta"}]
