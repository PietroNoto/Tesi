labs receiving intra-oral scan files if never, why? smaller labs bigger labs when the impact of ios scans on the lab business is positive, labs approach doctors more frequently. labs approaching dentists for the practice digitization is quite high, lower than average in the mediterranean countries. in spain, the development of digital technologies in the dental sector has accelerated significantly in the last two years, which is the reason why the percentage of laboratories approaching studies on this subject is high. the reason for not recommending varies with the size of the laboratories: small laboratories do not recommend because they do not feel adequate, while large laboratories, which are the most digitalised ones, are also the ones that can spend less time on this activity. bigger labs higher than average for a frequent approach (46% often). the frequency of the approaches to dentists is higher as the lab overall business trend is positive (43% often). labo base: 524 cases cases 123 108 101 91 101 full digital workflow 21 main arguments to convince doctors about digitization when discussing with your doctors about starting\/furthering the digitization process of their practice with an intra-oral scanner, what argumentation do you use to convince them?

38 labs digitization is considered to be very important. a lower importance is recorded for smaller labs, while the opposite is true for bigger sized labs. in addition, when training and education is considered very important, importance of digitization of the lab is high too (62%). moreover, among itero platform users and when lab business has increased, the opinion that importance of digitization of the lab is very high increases (59% and 63% respectively). even the interest in increasing the share of scans from dentists is high*: in overall 82% of interviewees are interested. the interest is lower for smaller labs (72% for yes). labo what impact do you feel the acceptance of the ios scans has had on your dental laboratory business? positive impact is widely quoted overall. again, smaller sized labs quote a lower-than-average positive impact (55%). respondents attributing a high importance to training and education do quote a more than average positive impact (73%). the same is for bigger sized labs (73%). in addition, labs performing ortho cases with aligners do feel more than average an overall positive impact (72%) and those performing a higher number of simple fixed prosthesis cases too (73%). *would you be interested in increasing the % of intra-oral scans received vs.","aided: please indicate if you know (even by hearsay) the following brands."]},"answer":{"0":"<|\n<|system|>\n<|user\n<|user \n<|system(s)\n<|user|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|system\n<|>\n<|>\n<|system\n<|>\n<|>\n<|system|>\n<|user \n<|>\n<|>\n<|user\n<|>\n<|>\n<|system|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user \n<|user \n<|>\n<|user\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user \n<|user\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user \n<|system\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|system|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user\n<|>\n<|user \n<|user|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user \n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|system|>\n<|>\n<|user \n<|>\n<|>\n<|user \n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|system|>\n<|>\n<|user \n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user \n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|system|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user\n","1":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n the percentage s (in s the percentage of the percentage (6 % the percentage of the percentage of the percentage for the.\n\n\n\n\n percentage of the percentage of %.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n percentage of percentage (percentage the percentage of percentage (the percentage of percentage of percentage (percent the percentage of percentage (percentage percentage (percent s percentage s percentage (percent (percent percentage of percentage (3 percentage (percent percentage of percentage (percent (percent percentage (6% the percentage of percentage (percent percentage of percentage (percent (percent percentage of percentage (percent percentage of percentage (percent percentage of percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage the percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent (percent percentage of percentage (percent (percentage percentage (s percentage (percent percentage of percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent (6 percentage of percentage (percent (6 percentage of percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent (percent percentage of percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent (percent (percent (percent (6 (percent percentage (percent (percent percentage (percent (6 percentage of percentage of percentage (6 percentage of percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent (percent (percent (percent (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent (percent (percent (percent (percent percentage (percent (percent percentage of percentage (percent (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent (percent percentage (percent (percent percentage (percent (percent (percent percentage (percent (percent (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent (percent percentage (percent (percent (percent (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent (percent percentage (percent (percent percentage (percent (percent (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent (percent percentage (percent (percent percentage (percent (percent (percent (percent (10% percentage (percent (percent (percent (percent (percent (percent (percent (10% (percent (10% percentage (percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percentage (percent (percent (percent percentage (percent (percent (percent percentage (percent (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent percentage (percent ("},"ground_truth":{"0":"3Shape is the most used intraoral scanner brand.","1":"Imes-Icore"},"context_precision":{"0":1.0,"1":0.9999999999},"faithfulness":{"0":0.0,"1":0.25},"answer_relevancy":{"0":0.2727747502,"1":0.2317429798},"context_recall":{"0":1.0,"1":1.0}}
