Spain and France have a higher-than-average overall frequency of approaches from doctors regarding intra-oral scanners compared to other analyzed countries. The most recommended brand in Spain and Italy is 3Shape, while ITERO is the most recommended brand in the UK. The reasons for recommending a specific intra-oral scanner brand include scanner performance, clinic\/lab integration, brand reputation, and community. The frequency of approaches to doctors about digitizing their practice with intra-oral scanners is quite high, but lower than average in Mediterranean countries. The reasons for not recommending a specific brand vary based on the size of the laboratory. Smaller laboratories do not recommend because they do not feel adequate, while larger laboratories, which are the most digitalized ones, are also the ones that can spend less time on this activity.","1":"<|system|>\n<|user|>\n<|>\n<|system|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|system|>\n<|>\n<|user|>\n<|user \n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|system|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user, \n<|>\n<|>\n<|user|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|system|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user \n<|system|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user \n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user \n<|>\n<|>\n<|user\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user \n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|system|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|user\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<|>\n<"},"ground_truth":{"0":"30% of Spanish dental labs are approached at least monthly by doctors about their recommendation on intra-oral scanners.","1":"The main reason why dental professionals are not willing to purchase an intra-oral scanner within 2 years is the price, followed by the lack of need and the preference for the traditional method."},"context_precision":{"0":1.0,"1":1.0},"faithfulness":{"0":0.8333333333,"1":0.0},"answer_relevancy":{"0":0.2514781571,"1":0.0},"context_recall":{"0":1.0,"1":0.5}}
