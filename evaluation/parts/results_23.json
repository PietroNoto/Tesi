(multiple choice) training \/ education and support are most quoted needs for additional services. dedicated lab support is more often quoted by bigger sized labs (64%) and in general by labs receiving higher than average scan files from clients and those equipped with milling unit (59%). lab-to-doctor education support is more often quoted by labs attributing a high importance to training and education (44%), by those receiving high shares of models\/impression works to digitize (48%) and by smaller sized labs (46%). access to restorative design services is more often quoted by labs receiving a higher share of scan files (37%) and those producing a higher number of ortho cases with aligners (37%). access to modelling and interpretation services are more often quoted by labs with higher share of clients sending scan files (34%) and by those performing higher production of ortho cases with aligners (41%). commercial partnership is more often quoted by labs with high share of clients sending scan files (33%) and those less involved in traditional techniques (31%). labo in the uk the issue of dedicated laboratory support and access to restorative design services are the most relevant. in some countries more elements are mentioned, for example in spain and italy both training and support in providing a synergistic training path between laboratory and clinic is very important. in fact, dentists often turn to the laboratory for guidance on digital flow management. base: 594 cases lab needs in terms of training importance of training and education 45 how do you rate the importance of training and education? mean: 4,5 importance of training \/ education is very high throughout, even more so in southern europe. training \/ education is higher than average very important among smaller labs (65%). and so is for less recently open labs (64%) and for those receiving a lower share of scan files (70%). again, it is higher than average very important for those who think that ios scans have had a positive impact on the laboratory business (62%). where digitalization rate is lower, the perception that training is very important increases (expansion phase). labo base: 594 cases cases 137 114 125 113 105 4,4 4,1 4,7 4,7 4,3 attended type of trainings 46 what types of trainings do you attend?

which intra-oral scanner brand do you recommend most often? 3shape is quoted more than average among big sized labs (49%), by the lab owners (39%), less recently open structures and those stating the business has decreased (40% and 46% respectively). itero is quoted more than average among more recently open labs (25%) and among labs receiving a high share of scan files (22%). less than average among labs performing a high share of prosthetic complex cases (12%). medit is quoted more than average among labs receiving a lower share of scan files (23%). dentsply sirona is quoted more than average among labs receiving scan files from more than half of clients (20%). labo recommendation is very high: on an overall basis, at least 90% of the laboratories approached by dentists recommend a brand. 3shape is the most recommended brand in spain and italy, while itero is most recommended in the uk. carestream has adopted a very widespread distribution and commercial strategy, which explains the high number of recommendations in italy (achieving a significantly higher penetration than in the other analysed countries). diverse recommended brands across the surveyed countries: 3shape is most quoted, itero is main follower. why do you recommend the mentioned ios brand? (multiple choice) scanner performance and clinic \/ lab integration are the most quoted reasons. brand reputation is quoted more often among bigger sized labs (62%) and those performing ortho cases with invisible aligners (58%). the latter also quote community more often than average (20%). integration is quoted more often by labs serving a higher number of practices (60%)."],"1":["key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 18 chart 19a and 19b. use of digital technologies breakdown by technology and channel europe in overall, it is also possible to analyze the information shown at slides 15 and 17 by crossing the data, whose results are shown in the following chart. the chart shows in the rows the information regarding the technologies (in-lab milling, scanner and full outsourcing). in the columns the information is related to both the channels and the technologies. the information can be read as follows: with regard to the technology users, out of the total scanner users (red circled data, respondents using a scanner to send the scan files outside for milling), in 11% of the cases they also have an in-lab milling at the laboratory, and in 10% of the cases they also send the models outside for milling (either to a manufacturer\/milling center or a partner lab). on the other hand, with regard to the channel users, out of the total manufacturer users (blue circled data, respondents sending either the models or scan files to a manufacturer\/milling center), in 91% of the cases they send the scan files to a manufacturer, in 11% of the cases they have an in-lab milling, and in 19% of the cases they also send their models outside for milling to a manufacturer. this is a kind of multiple answer question. also, the same information is available with the channels in rows, and in the columns there are again both the channels and the technologies. the information can be read as follows: with regard to the technology users, out of the total scanner users (red circled data, respondents sending their scan files outside for milling), in 85% of key-stone omnivision digital europe 2015_executive_summary - 19 the cases, they send the scan files to the manufacturer\/milling center channel, in 44% of the cases they also send the scan files to a partner lab, and 11% of them also have an in-lab milling. on the other hand, with regard to the channel users, out of the total partner lab users (blue circled data, respondents sending their models or scan files to a partner lab), 48% of them also send their models or scan files to a manufacturer\/milling center and 11% of them also have an in-lab milling. of course, this is a kind of multiple answer question as well.","it interesting to notice the change in the weight of the various items in comparison to intention to buy ranking 2015 too expensive 32% i dont need it 28% low demand 24% i prefer the traditional method 10% poor system precision 6% poor familiarity with technologies 4% other 2% dont know \/ no answer 0% labo digital technologies in laboratories breakdown by technology and channel labo digital technology use: breakdown by channel taking into considerations all the elements made with cad-cam systems, what percentage do you use the following supply channels?
