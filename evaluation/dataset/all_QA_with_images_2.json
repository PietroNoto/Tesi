appropriate statistical techniques and methodologies. 4 methodology and statistical note glossary the confidence level indicates the reliability of the research. for example, a confidence level of 95% means that the phenomenon identified by the research is certain in 95% of cases. the confidence interval indicates how much the research data may deviate from reality. in the current study, with a 95% confidence level, the maximum error (confidence interval) is +/- 5,1%. the sample (thus the survey) does not represent the overall market but rather the segment of those who intend to purchase an ios deviceexecutive summary 5 the image contains a detailed view of a bar chart that appears to be a section of an analytical webpage or dashboard. it is set against a dark background that includes abstract shapes and lines, giving it an informational and corporate design. the bar chart features numerous bars, each representing data points, possibly representing stock prices, market performance, or similar financial metrics. each bar in the chart is white, clearly contrasting with the dark background. the bars are connected by white lines, suggesting trend lines or price movements over time. overlaid on the bars and line trends are several dotted and dashed lines, which indicate levels, moving averages, or other analytical indicators, common in financial analysis. on the right side of the bar chart, there is a downward-facing triangle that appears to be part of the trend visualization, pointing to a potential area of concern or downside. the overall design is sleek, with a digital and modern aesthetic, implying that this image is part of a business dashboard, possibly for monitoring stock or financial performance. the top-left corner of the image features a small section where the word executive is visible and the image of a graph is seen, suggesting that this chart is part of an 'executive summary' view, meant to present a higher-level overview of key data points. this alignment with the \"executive summary\" title reinforces the strategic and high-level nature of the information being displayed.6 executive summary sample segmentation: implant users implantology is

actuales y pasados) sobre las dependientes (in este caso, satisfacción global). el análisis de correlación bivariada ha sido usado para cuantificar la relación entre las puntuaciones otorgadas a cada ítem y la puntuación en la satisfacción global. de este modo, es posible construir una “jerarquía de importancia” a partir las declaraciones individuales, situarlas en un gráfico y, posteriormente, en un mapa. el eje vertical siempre muestra las puntuaciones de satisfacción que han recibido de media los diferentes ítems, mientras que el horizontal, muestra su influencia en la satisfacción global. en este sentido, se ha obtenido una “importancia estimada” para cada ítem propuesto a los entrevistados, que resulta ligeramente diferente de las declaraciones explícitas. el análisis del peso de cada uno de los factores, y no solo de la importancia declarada, permite realizar interesantes consideraciones. los ítems obtienen diferentes significados en función del punto de vista con el cual sean analizados: nota estadística satisfacción hacia el mercado total aquí es posible evidenciar ciertos prerrequisitos (cuadrante superior derecho del mapa, donde todos los competidores satisfacen el
