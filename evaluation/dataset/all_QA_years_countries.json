the bar represents 29%, marked with a dark blue color. - this is the highest percentage displayed out of the five countries listed. 2. **united kingdom** - the bar represents 8%, marked with a lighter blue color. -

multiple barriers related to the adoption of an intraoral scanner, with each barrier rated on a three-point scale from 'not a problem' (1-6), 'quite a problem' (7-8), to 'serious problem' (9-10). the first row illustrates different economic and logistical issues respondents face when adopting an intraoral scanner. for instance, in france, 44% consider the economic investment as a serious problem while 37% perceive it as an issue, and 20% do not see it as a problem. similarly, in italy, 52% of respondents view economic costs as serious, 20% find it only a minor issue, and the remainder feel it is not a problem. spain shows a more mixed response: 22% (serious), 31% (considerable), and 47% (not a problem). the other barriers listed in the dataset include high costs for model printing, technology still evolving, and forcing the usage of certain software. the percentages of respondents rating these as serious, quite severe, or not a problem are consistent across france, italy, and spain, with similar variations in ratings. the image also contains graphs representing the mean vote (indicating the levels of concern  and represents 65% of the significance. 3. **spain**: - the top section of the bar is in pink and accounts for 21% of the significance. - the bottom section is in turquoise and represents 62% of the significance. beneath each bar graph, there is a small box with the percentage indicated, corresponding to the split between the two sections of the bars: france: 5% and 33% italy: 10% and 65% spain: 9% and 62% this data suggests that in the three countries, a majority perceive high (over 50%) importance to compatibility with invisalign. the percentage breakdown emphasizes the specific range of importance, with italy reflecting the highest percentage for high importance (65%). on the left side, there are three graphical elements: first element illustrates the generalized context of compatibility concerns across three countries: a pie chart with 24% highlighted in a deeper magenta, indicating \"invisalign importance\" and the remaining 76% with alternating pink and light turquoise percentages. below, a note states \"9% of the total sample.\" second element includes a table highlighting the \"important factors when choosing a scanner\" and their corresponding percentage among io and non-io owners. factors like \"reading accuracy\" and  the recent purchase category, and a smaller portion falls into the pre-2022 purchase category. this reflects the trends in the market where new purchases are more common compared to older investments. the visual presentation allows for a clear understanding of the proportions among different periods of purchase. the image contains a bar graph title \"country\" which is a portion of a larger infographic. this graph shows a comparison between three countries france, italy, and spain in terms of a specific variable represented by the percentages on the vertical axis, against the horizontal axis which represents different groups within the respective countries. the following details can be noted from the image: three separate bars represent each of the three countries: france, italy, and spain. each bar is segmented into two colors: teal and red. the height of the teal section indicates one percentage ratio, and the height of the red section indicates another percentage ratio. for france, the teal section of the bar rises to 67%, and the red section rises to 33%. for italy, the teal section of the bar rises to 77%, and the red section rises to 23%. for spain, the teal section of the bar rises to 68%, and the red section rises to 32%. none  variations in ratings. the image also contains graphs representing the mean vote (indicating the levels of concern across different issues) for each country, visually reinforcing the data in the table. france shows a trend of increasing concern from 5.5 to 6.7 in mean vote, italy moves from 4.9 to 5.4, and spain slightly increases from 6.4 to 7.3 for the same period. additionally, the graphs depict the trend over a unspecified number of years, displaying a mixed increase and decrease pattern, particularly noticeable within the purple (spain) and blue (italy) lines. overall, the second image serves as a comprehensive breakdown of how various economic and technical barriers impact the adoption of intraoral scanners in non-owner dental practices, providing detailed insights into respondent perceptions across different countries. the image shows a line graph that displays data points and trends over time for two
