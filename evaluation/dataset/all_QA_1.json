henry schein, megadental, gacd, and proclinic confirm their position as the main suppliers mentioned by the sample of respondents. however, some exclusively online suppliers are present in the top positions of the numerical distribution. this is the case with dental leader, dental good deal, and dentalclick. furthermore, it is worth highlighting the increase in the numerical distribution of dentsply sirona compared to 2018. 107 114% base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) dental dealers: numeric distribution - pqi index who are your main suppliers for consumable products? 108 the comparison between numeric distribution and the \"top used\", highlights relevant differences in the pqi index. example: henry schein is used by 33% of the respondents and 42% of them uses it as the main supplier. proclinic is less frequently quoted overall, but it is mentioned as the first supplier more frequently than henry schein (51%). the overlap index represents the average number of providers mentioned by each respondent: the sum of the percentage is 276%, that is, on average each respondent uses slightly less than 3 (2,76) providers for consumable products. it is interesting to note how the number of suppliers has increased compared to this is highlighted by the pqi index, which has gone from just over 1,5 to almost the use of multiple suppliers appears to be a structural trend in dentists purchasing behavior, thanks also to various online proposals. in fact, traditional dealers are noticed alongside online suppliers in the top positions of the frequency distribution. base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) dental dealers: numeric distribution - pqi index map who are your main suppliers for consumable products? the information described before, may be easily visualized in this positioning map, in which the quantitative variable (numeric distribution) and qualitative variable (pqi) are intersected. among the generalist suppliers, proclinic stands out as having the best performance in terms of the pqi index, meaning it is mentioned more frequently as the primary supplier. henry schein is by far the most mentioned overall and shows an improved ability to be mentioned as the first supplier in the practice compared to however, other main suppliers also show a better pqi index performance (e.g., in addition to proclinic, megadental and dental leader). although the numerical distribution is still low (4%), aera-online is the leading supplier in terms of pqi index performance. 109 numeric distribution + pqi index + base: 1.018 cases (whole sample) expectations about the future future changes in the activity of the practice do you plan to make changes to your practice over the next two years?

to 100% the number of quotes received for the given attributes. it is not a frequency distribution among all brands, but for each brand, a frequency distribution of all attributes is shown. for example: out of 3m total quotes, scientific represents 9%. in dentsply sirona distribution, the attribute with the highest number of quotes is digital company, while for gc is excellent/the best. key take aways 41 in several cases, dentsply sirona is mentioned more frequently compared to various attributes, closely approaching - and in some cases surpassing - the performance of 3m. this is true, for example, for the attributes \"high reputation, \"innovative / cutting edge, flexible / versatile, young and modern. it is worth noting an improvement in ivoclar performance: \"innovative / cutting edge, \"friendly / intimate,\" and \"easy to use\" are some examples where the percentage of respondents mentioning this brand has significantly increased. there is an increase in brand awareness for companies in the digital world. although this may not be evident in overall brand awareness, it becomes clear when analyzing specific attributes. for example, align technology is mentioned in the attributes \"innovative / cutting edge,\" \"young and modern,\" and \"reliable.\" regarding digital brands, it is also worth highlighting their significant presence in the attribute \"innovative / cutting edge,\" a phenomenon not observed in a separate mention should be made for the attribute \"digital company\": apart from the obvious presence of brands in this area, it is interesting to note the clear positioning of dentsply sirona, which aligns well with the strategic change undertaken several years ago, making it the top brand mentioned in this context. key take aways 42 regarding the price positioning, there is a noticeable shift in dentsply sirona performance, as it not the first quoted brand anymore for the item very affordable\" while it is the first quoted one in the items more related to a premium price area. there is a significant improvement for ivoclar in the attribute \"ideal quality/price ratio,\" making it the third most mentioned brand in this edition after 3m and dentsply sirona. analyzing the frequency distributions of the items by individual brand, the following phenomena can be observed: for 3m, the item \"scientific\" is mentioned more frequently compared to \"high reputation\" in for dentsply sirona, the focus on the digital field is confirmed, but in terms of price, the most mentioned item is \"too expensive\" instead of \"good but expensive\" in for ivoclar, the scientific and innovative areas are mentioned more frequently, along with ease of use and flexibility. it is interesting to note the shift from \"good but expensive\" to \"ideal quality/price ratio.\" for kulzer, the most mentioned items are \"effective / concrete\" and \"flexible / versatile.\" correspondence analysis it is a descriptive statistical technique applicable to qualitative variables, whose purpose is to summarize and plot the relationships expressed by a frequency table. the analysis allows to represent as points of the same space (typically a plane) the considered variables, i.e. the rows and columns of the frequency table. with this system, the similarities / differences between rows and / or columns are processed respectively in proximity / distance of the points from one another. through the use of this statistical technique, it is possible to highlight the perception of the respondents and make a comparison among the brands under analysis. depending on the position of the attributes on the plan (active variables) and the proximity of the passive variables (represented by the brands), the perceived positioning in the imagery of the sample can be better understood. statistical note 43 correspondence analysis: positioning drivers 44 sustainable value and convenience this concept encompasses the effectiveness and practicality of the brand, social responsibility and environmental awareness, ease of use, flexibility and versatility, as well as a friendly and intimate approach in the customer experience. the perception is a convenient offering while respecting sustainability and user needs. those brands provide dentists with everything they need in a 360-degree approach. premium authority this definition summarizes the attributes present in this area: a high reputation based on a solid scientific foundation, excellence and superior quality, inspiring trust, a brands history and tradition. however, the attribute too expensive indicates that it may be considered a high-end or luxury brand with a higher price compared to the average. tech-forward leadership this area represents brands that stand out for their innovation, advanced digital presence, and the young and modern image they convey. these attributes indicate that the brand is at the forefront of new technologies, digitally oriented, and targeting a young and modern audience. tech- forward leadership emphasizes leadership in the technological field and the companys modern approach in providing innovative solutions. unlike the map proposed in 2018, the correspondence analysis in this edition does not clearly present two main axes. however, it is possible to identify certain positioning areas that are characterized by the presence of specific attributes that give rise to the names of these areas, as described below: correspondence analysis: positioning drivers 45 sustainable value and convenience premium authority tech-forward leadership correspondence analysis: complete map 46 correspondence analysis: brands only 47 sustainable value and convenience premium authority tech-forward leadership key take aways 48 first and foremost, it is interesting to note the positioning of orthodontic companies, which are primarily those belonging to the world of invisible aligner manufacturers. their positioning is perfectly compatible with the belonging area on this map. as observed in the past, catalog sales/mail-order businesses are positioned in the convenience area. straumann's positioning is heavily focused on performance, excellence, and the premium concept. it is noteworthy the positioning of dentsply sirona in the perception of dentists: it is close to the digital technology area but also relevant to the concept of being premium, as previously observed in the frequency distribution of attributes that have been analyzed. ivoclar and ultradent are positioned close to the concepts of effectiveness, practicality, and ease of use, with the brand gc being particularly close to the latter. kulzer's positioning is closely associated with the concepts of flexibility and versatility, voco with good value for money, and zhermack is closer to the convenience area. 49 brand image: items score brand positioning mean all brands (1.142 quotes) brand image: focus on brands - all brands
